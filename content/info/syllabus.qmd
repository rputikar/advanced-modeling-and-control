## Topics covered

We will cover a broad range of topics including: 

- Cascade, Ratio and Feedforward control. 
- PID Enhancements: inferential, over-ride and selective control; scheduling
  controller tuning; implementation 
- Other Advanced Control Techniques: deadtime compensation; adaptive control
  (programmed adaptation; self-tuning control; online parameter estimation). 
- Multi-input Multi-output Systems: process and control loop interactions;
  control loop pairings; decoupling control systems; multivariable control.
- Digital Control Systems: Z transforms; discrete time models; dynamic
  response; discrete time control algorithms; closed loop analysis; digital
  control system implementation. Review of process modelling and simulation
  techniques. Modelling for Fault Diagnosis: prediction-based and
  identification-based diagnosis. Empirical Modelling: linear and non-linear
  models; artificial neural networks; ARMAX models. 
- Modelling Hybrid (Discrete- Continuous) Systems: representation and solution. 
- Case Studies and Applications in Process Engineering.
