## Topics covered

We will cover a broad range of topics including: 

- Cascade, Ratio and Feedforward control. 
- PID Enhancements: inferential, over-ride and selective control; scheduling
  controller tuning; implementation 
- Other Advanced Control Techniques: deadtime compensation; adaptive control
  (programmed adaptation; self-tuning control; online parameter estimation). 
- Multi-input Multi-output Systems: process and control loop interactions;
  control loop pairings; decoupling control systems; multivariable control.
- Digital Control Systems: Z transforms; discrete time models; dynamic
  response; discrete time control algorithms; closed loop analysis; digital
  control system implementation. Review of process modelling and simulation
  techniques. Modelling for Fault Diagnosis: prediction-based and
  identification-based diagnosis. Empirical Modelling: linear and non-linear
  models; artificial neural networks; ARMAX models. 
- Modelling Hybrid (Discrete- Continuous) Systems: representation and solution. 
- Case Studies and Applications in Process Engineering.

### Books

The books listed in [the course reading
list](https://curtin.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/readinglist/lists/14056101590001951)
will be very userful reference material for topics covered in the course.   

### Other materials

- Process control - Analysis, Design, and Assessment course from IIT Madras.

## Course policies

Please refer to the unit outline posted on blackboard for assessment policies. 

## Assessments and grades

- **Assessment Task 1: Lab reports (30%)** <br> 
  Lab report (a group of 2) needs to be submitted within two
  weeks of conducting the lab. Total 9 reports are submitted for 9 labs. The
  best six assessments are considered in the final marks.

- **Assessment Task 2: Midsemester Test (30%)** <br>
  This will cover the lectures 1 to 5. The format for the test will be
  communicated in due course. 

- **Assessment Task 3: Group project (40%)** <br>
  This is a group project (maximum 3 students per group) which focuses on the
  applications of the theories and concepts (in decentralized control, model
  development and analysis) on a given case study (to be explained further
  during the lectures). The project statement will be released in week 6.

**Pass requirements** <br>
Students must achieve final mark of 50% or greater to pass this unit. Please
refer to the unit outline posted on blackboard for more details.
