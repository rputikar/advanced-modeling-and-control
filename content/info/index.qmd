## Attendance and participation

It is essential to complete the required pre class activities for each class
session **prior to** watching the lecture.

Your active participation and preparedness in class, is essential before you
come to the class on Monday. **This includes having read the material and watched
the videos**. This will enable you to engage in discussions and collaborate with
your peers.

Attendance and participation will play a vital role in your success in this
course. Unfortunately, our labs do not have online collaboration capabilities.
Therefore, all the in class activities, workshops, and labs will be in person
and will not be recorded. If you anticipate missing a lab session, you will
need to apply for extension and complete the lab work in your own time later. 

That said, I am here to support you in your learning. If by any chance you are
going through any issues that may have an impact on your participation in the
unit (e.g. attending a session, sitting for test, completing project etc.),
inform me at the earliest and I will do my best to accomodate your
requirements.
