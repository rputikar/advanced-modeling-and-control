## Objectives

1. To develop PLS models using plsregress function.
2. To compare the PLS model predictive accuracies for different input shapes:
3. Uniform random numbers for sampling periods T~s~=0.5 and T~s~=1.5
4. Sequential step changes for sampling periods T~s~=0.5 and T~s~=1.5
5. To implement the PLS models as soft sensors for y~1~ and y~2~

## Problem Statement {#sec-process-information}

@fig-1 shows a distillation process that is represented using the [Simulink model](./abx_process.slx). The outputs (responses) are the distillate product impurity y~1~ and bottom product impurity y~2~. There are 3 measured state variables: x~1~ and x~2~ are tray temperatures while x~3~ is column pressure. Also, there 3 measured inputs: u~1~ is feed flow rate, u~2~ reflux flow rate and u~3~ steam flow rate to the distillation boiler. Note that both response variables y~1~ and y~2~ are difficult to measure but their values must be kept with acceptable ranges. Also note that, the values shown by the Simulink model simulation are based on the nominal operating values, not the absolute values. As a process control engineer in your company, you are responsible for the profitable operation of the distillation column. To enable tight control of the two response variables, you have decided to build two soft sensors for measuring the variables. The soft sensors are developed using the well-known PLS models.

## Tasks
i.	Construct several PLS models using the plsregress function in Matlab for the different input shapes and sampling periods. Tabulate the regression coefficients and MSE values of all PLS models.
[3 marks]
ii.	Compare the PLS modelling accuracies based on the MSE values. Comments on the impact of input shapes and sampling periods on the modelling accuracies.
[3 marks]
iii.	Implement 2 of your best PLS models on the given Simulink model. Run the simulation for some input changes (you may mix both shapes, e.g., step tests for inputs 1 and 2, and random number for input 3). Plot the actual and predicted profiles of the response variables. Comments on the results.
