## Objectives

1. To design a cascade control system using nested feedback loops with primary (outer) and secondary (inner) controllers.

2. To implement and compare cascade vs. conventional (single-loop) control strategies for setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection.

3. To develop a MATLAB Simulink model for the cascade control system and tune both controllers using the PID Tuner or analytical methods.

## Process information {#sec-process-information}

### Case 1

The transfer functions for the primary process and secondary (inner-loop) process are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Primary Process: } G_p(s) &= \frac{2.5 \exp (-4 s)}{(5 s+1)} \\
\\[1em]
\text { Secondary Process: } G_s(s) &= \frac{-1.6 \exp (-1.2 s)}{1.5 s+1}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-case-1}

### Case 2

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Primary Process: } G_p(s) &= \frac{0.2 \exp (-5 s)}{s} \\
\\[1em]
\text { Secondary Process: } G_s(s) &= \frac{2 \exp (-0.8 s)}{2 s+1}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-case-1}


## Methodology

For each case in [@sec-process-information]

1. Tune a PI controller using a classical PID tuning formula.

2. Develop the Simulink models for the feedback control using primary loop only and
   cascade control strategy (with a tightly tuned inner loop). 

3. Evaluate the control performance for:

   - Setpoint tracking (Step input in setpoint)

   - Disturbance rejections for input disturbance.

   - Disturbance rejections for output disturbance.

## Error Metrics

Use the following metrics to quantify performance:

1. Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE):
   $$
   ITAE = \int_0^T t \cdot |e(t)| \, dt
   $$

   ITAE penalizes large errors that persist for a long time.

2. Integral of Absolute Error (IAE):
   $$
   IAE = \int_0^T |e(t)| \, dt
   $$

   IAE gives a measure of the total absolute error over time and is sensitive
   to both the magnitude and duration of the error.

3. Integral of Squared Error (ISE):
   $$
   ISE = \int_0^T e(t)^2 \, dt
   $$
   
   ISE penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors, making it
   useful when minimizing large errors is particularly important.

4. Integral of Time-weighted Squared Error (ITSE):
   $$
   ITSE = \int_0^T t \cdot e(t)^2 \, dt
   $$

   ITSE is similar to ISE but includes a time-weighting factor, penalizing
   errors that persist for longer periods.

5. Peak Absolute Error (PAE):

   PAE is the maximum absolute error that occurs over the time period of
   interest. It's a measure of the largest deviation from the desired output.

6. Settling Time:

   The settling time is the time required for the error to fall within a
   specified percentage (e.g., 2% or 5%) of the final steady-state value and
   stay within that range.

7. Rise Time:

   The rise time is the time required for the system response to rise from a
   specified lower percentage to a specified higher percentage of its final
   steady-state value.

8. Overshoot:

   Overshoot is the percentage by which the system's response exceeds its final
   steady-state value. It gives an indication of the stability and damping of
   the system.

1. Objective & Problem Statement

   Briefly describe the goal of using cascade control and summarize the given process dynamics.

2. Methodology & Implementation

   * Describe the setup of feedback-only and cascade control models
   * Provide Simulink diagrams with brief explanations
   * Explain controller tuning methods used for inner and outer loops

3. Results

   * Show the system response for both control strategies under:
     - Setpoint tracking
     - Input and output disturbance rejection

   * Include well-labeled plots with appropriate axes, legends, and annotations.

   * Summarize relevant performance metrics such as IAE, ITAE, overshoot, rise time, and settling time for each scenario.

4. Analysis and Discussion

   * Compare and interpret the performance of the two control strategies: feedback-only vs. cascade control.

   * Address the following points:

     - Does cascade control improve disturbance rejection compared to feedback-only? Why?
     - Does cascade control provide better setpoint tracking? Explain using plots and metrics.
     - How robust is each control configuration under Â±10% model mismatch in time constants or gain?
     - Quantitatively assess and compare the performance of each method using the selected metrics (e.g., IAE, overshoot, settling time).

5. Conclusion

   * Summarize your key observations
   * State when cascade control is most advantageous
