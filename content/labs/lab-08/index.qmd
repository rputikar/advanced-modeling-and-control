## Objectives

* To develop MATLAB Simulink models for continuous and digital PI control systems.  
* To simulate and compare the performance of continuous and discrete
(digital) PI controllers for different sampling periods: $T_s = 0.5$, $1.0$,
and $2.0$ seconds.  
* To analyze the effect of sampling period on control
performance and stability.  

## Problem Statement {#sec-process-information}

In practical control systems, continuous-time controllers are often implemented
digitally using sampling and zero-order hold (ZOH) techniques. The sampling
period significantly affects control accuracy and stability — too slow a
sampling rate degrades performance, while too fast a rate increases
computational cost.  

The process under consideration is represented by the following transfer
function:

$$
G_p(s) = \frac{5 e^{-2s}}{(7s + 1)(s + 1)}
$${#eq-process}

An output disturbance enters through the following transfer function:

$$
G_d(s) = \frac{1.4 e^{-3s}}{(10s + 1)}
$${#eq-disturbance}

You are required to implement and compare continuous and digital PI control
systems for this process using MATLAB Simulink. The digital controller should
use a zero-order hold and sampler, and the sampling period should be
varied as described in the objectives.  

## Methodology

1. Simulink Model Development
   - Create a combined Simulink model that includes:
     - The process $G_p(s)$  
     - The disturbance path $G_d(s)$  
     - A continuous PI controller  
     - A discrete PI controller implemented with Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) and Sampler blocks  
   - Configure the sampling period $T_s$ for the digital controller as 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 seconds.  
   - Use the same controller gains for both implementations.  

2. PI Controller Tuning
   - Tune a continuous PI controller for the process using Control System Designer or IMC-based tuning.  
   - Record the controller gains ($K_c$, $\tau_I$).  
   - Verify the closed-loop response for reference tracking and disturbance rejection.  

3. Digital PI Controller Conversion
   - Discretize the continuous PI controller using the Tustin (bilinear) or backward Euler method.  
   - Implement the digital controller in Simulink using either:
     - The Discrete PID Controller block, or  
     - The continuous PID block with sample time = $T_s$.  
   - Ensure a zero-order hold (ZOH) is used between the digital controller and the process.  

4. Simulation Setup
   - Simulate step changes in the setpoint and output disturbance for both the continuous and digital control loops.  
   - Run simulations for $T_s = 0.5$, $1.0$, and $2.0$ seconds.  
   - Observe and record key performance parameters: rise time, overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error.  

5. Performance Comparison
   - Compare continuous and digital control performance using time-domain plots.  
   - Analyze the degradation in response with increasing sampling time.  
   - Discuss the trade-off between sampling speed, control accuracy, and computational cost.

1. Objective & Problem Statement

   Summarize the aim of digital control implementation and explain why sampling
   period selection is important. Include the process and disturbance transfer
   functions.

2. Methodology & Implementation

   Describe the structure of the Simulink model and key components (ZOH,
   sampler, discrete PID).  Explain how the PI controller was tuned and
   discretized.  Provide screenshots of the Simulink model and show where the
   sampling period is defined.  

3. Results

   Present time-domain responses (setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection)
   for both continuous and digital controllers. Show results for $T_s = 0.5$,
   $1.0$, and $2.0$. Include a table summarizing rise time, settling time,
   overshoot, and steady-state error for each case.  

4. Analysis and Discussion

   Compare performance between continuous and discrete systems.  Discuss how
   the sampling period influences controller accuracy and stability.  Explain any
   performance degradation at larger $T_s$.  Relate findings to real-world digital
   control implementation.  

5. Conclusion

   Summarize key findings. Recommend an appropriate sampling period based on
   the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Reflect on the importance of
   sampling rate selection in digital control system design.
