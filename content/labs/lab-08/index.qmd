## Objectives

1. To develop MATLAB Simulink model of continuous and digital control systems.
2. To simulate digital PI controller vs. continuous PI controller performance for different sampling periods T: 0.5, 1, 2.


## Problem Statement {#sec-process-information}

A continuous process is represented by the following transfer function:

$$
G_p (s) = \frac{5 exp(-2s)}{(7s+1)(s+1)}
$${#eq-process}

Also, an output disturbance transfer function is given by,

$$
G_d (s) = \frac{1.4 exp(-3s)}{( 10s+1)}
$${#eq-disturbance}

For the digital PI controller implementation, use zero-order hold and sampler where the sampling period can be varied as mentioned in the objectives.

## Tasks

i.	Develop a Simulink model that contains the continuous and digital control systems. Provide the screenshot of the Simulink model in the report. [2 marks]
ii. Tune a PI controller for the continuous control system, e.g., using Control System Designer. [1 mark]
iii. Apply the PI controller tuning in (b) to the continuous and digital systems. For the digital system, switch the continuous mode to the discrete mode. [2 marks]
iv. Compare the performance of the digital PI controller for the 3 different sampling periods mentioned above with the continuous PI controller. Plot the responses and give comments on the results. [5 marks]
