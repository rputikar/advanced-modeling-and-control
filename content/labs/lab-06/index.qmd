## Objectives

i. To develop a MATLAB Simulink model for multi-loop PID control of a 2×2 MIMO
process.  

ii. To apply and compare different PI controller tuning methods for multi-loop
systems.  

iii. To evaluate the performance of the tuned controllers for setpoint
tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness under model uncertainty.  

## Problem Statement {#sec-process-information}

In many industrial systems, processes involve multiple inputs and multiple
outputs (MIMO) that are dynamically coupled. Controller design for such
processes requires careful pairing of manipulated and controlled variables and
effective tuning of multiple loops.  

Consider the 2×2 MIMO process represented by the transfer function matrix:

$$
G(s) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{22.89 e^{-0.2 s}}{4.572 s + 1} & \frac{-11.64 e^{-0.4 s}}{1.807 s + 1} \\
\frac{4.689 e^{-0.2 s}}{2.174 s + 1} & \frac{5.80 e^{-0.4 s}}{1.801 s + 1}
\end{bmatrix}
$${#eq-1}

This process exhibits cross-coupling between manipulated inputs and controlled
outputs. To achieve satisfactory performance, an appropriate controller
pairing strategy must be chosen, and decentralized controllers must be tuned
for each loop.

## Methodology

1. Controller Pairing and Decoupling  
   - Use a controller pairing method (e.g., Relative Gain Array to select
     suitable input–output pairings.  

   - Reduce the decentralized system to a diagonal form by defining two
     Effective Open-Loop Transfer Functions (EOTFs).  

2. PI Controller Tuning  
   - Apply two different tuning methods for the decentralized loops (e.g.,
     Ziegler–Nichols, IMC tuning, or other methods).  

   - Design two sets of PI controllers based on the chosen methods.  

   - Implement the controllers in MATLAB Simulink.  

3. Setpoint Tracking Tests  

   - Perform simulations for sequential setpoint changes:  
     - +1 unit step change in $y_1$ setpoint  
     - +1 unit step change in $y_2$ setpoint  

   - Record and compare the closed-loop responses under both tuning methods.  

4. Disturbance Rejection Tests  

   - Apply +1 unit step disturbances directly to the outputs $y_1$ and $y_2$.  

   - Compare controller performance for disturbance rejection between the two
     tuning methods.  

5. Robustness to Model Errors  
   - Introduce model mismatches:  
     - Gain errors of ±10%  
     - Dead-time errors of ±20%  
   - Simulate the closed-loop system under these uncertainties.  
   - Compare and summarize the effect of model mismatch on each tuning method.
