## Objectives

1.	To develop a MATLAB Simulink model for multi-loop PID control simulation
2.	To apply controller tuning methods.

## Problem Statement {#sec-process-information}

Consider a 2x2 MIMO process given as follows:

$$
G(s)=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{22.89 e^{-0.2 s}}{4.572 s+1} & \frac{-11.64 e^{-0.4 s}}{1.807 s+1} \\
\frac{4.689 e^{-0.2 s}}{2.174 s+1} & \frac{5.80 e^{-0.4 s}}{1.801 s+1}
\end{array}\right]
$${#eq-1}

## Tasks
1. Determine suitable controller pairings for the MIMO process given above. Based on the results of the controller pairing analysis, next reduce the decentralized system above to a diagonal form with two effective open-loop transfer functions (EOTF). [2.5 marks]

2. Complete the multi-loop PI controller tuning using the aforementioned 2 different tuning methods stated in the objectives. Then, evaluate the multi-loop PI controller performances for sequential setpoint tracking to 1 unit step change in the setpoints of y_1 and y_2. Analysis the simulation results and identify which of the 2 tuning methods gives the best performance for this particular MIMO process. [2.5 marks]

3. Next, evaluate the multi-loop PI controller performance for disturbance rejection: consider 1 unit step changes in the output disturbances to y_1 and y_2. Again, based on your analysis of the simulation results identify the best multi-loop PI control system. [2.5 marks]

4. Suppose that there are modelling errors in the process model where the gain errors are 10% and deadtime errors are 20%. Under these modelling errors, run the simulation of the multi-loop PI control systems involved. Analyze the simulation results and summarize 2 key findings from the simulation. [2.5 marks]
