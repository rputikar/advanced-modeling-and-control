## Objectives

i. To design a feedforward controller in combination with a feedback controller

ii. To evaluate the performances with and without feedforward controller in the
cases of setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection. 

iii. To develop Matlab Simulink model for the combined feedforward-feedback
control strategy

## Process information

The transfer functions for the process and disturbance are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Process: } G_p(s) &= \frac{10 \exp (-2 s)}{(10 s+1)(1.5 s+1)} \\
\text { Disturbance: } G_d(s) &= \frac{-8 \exp (-3 s)}{20 s+1}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-tf}

## Simulation


Develop the Simulink models for the feedback control only and
feedforward-feedback control strategies. Design the feedback (PID) controller
using the PID tuner app. Also, design the feedforward controller using the
idealized method. 

Evaluate the control performance for:

i. Setpoint tracking

ii. Disturbance rejections for both input and output disturbances

A second-order model can be reduced using the Skogestadâ€™s half rule [@skogestad2003jopc] given
by [@eq-skogestad-half].

$$
G(s)=\frac{K_p e^{-\theta_p s}}{\left(\tau_1 s+1\right)\left(\tau_2 s+1\right)} \cong \frac{K_p e^{-\theta_e s}}{\tau_1 s+1} \text { where } \tau_1>\tau_2 \text { and } \theta_e=\theta_p+\tau_2

## Report Format

1) Show the MATLAB Simulink Model of the combined feedforward-feedback control
strategy. Briefly explain the model. [2 marks]

2) Show the PID controller and feedforward controllers (using idealized
method). [2 marks]

3) Compare and comment on the control performances (setpoint tracking and
disturbance rejection) of the two control strategies: (1) feedback control only,
and (2) combined feedbackfeedforward control (idealized method). Show the plots
of the controlled variable under the two different control strategies. [6
marks]

i. Does the implementation of the feedforward controller improve the setpoint
or disturbance rejection performance?

ii. Will the control system remain stable when subjected to the 10% modelling
errors?

iii. Which feedforward controller that gives the best result, based on the
unified or idealized method?
