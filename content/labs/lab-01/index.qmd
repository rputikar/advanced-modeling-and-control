## Objectives

* Design a feedforward controller integrated with a feedback (PID) controller
for a dynamic process.

* Evaluate and compare the performance of feedback-only vs. combined
feedforward-feedback control strategies for setpoint tracking and disturbance
rejection.

* Implement the control strategies in MATLAB Simulink using the PID Tuner and
the idealized feedforward design method.

## Process information

The process and disturbance dynamics are described by the following transfer functions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Process: } G_p(s) &= \frac{10 \exp (-2 s)}{(10 s+1)(1.5 s+1)} \\
\text { Disturbance: } G_d(s) &= \frac{-8 \exp (-3 s)}{20 s+1}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-tf}

To simplify controller design, the process second order model can be
approximated using Skogestad’s half-rule [@skogestad2003jopc]:

$$
G(s)=\frac{K_p e^{-\theta_p s}}{\left(\tau_1 s+1\right)\left(\tau_2 s+1\right)} 
\cong \frac{K_p e^{-\theta_e s}}{\tau_1 s+1} 
$${#eq-skogestad-half}

where $\theta_e = \theta_p + \tau_2$, and $\tau_1 > \tau_2$.

## Simulation Tasks

* Develop Simulink models for:
  - Feedback-only control using a tuned PID controller.
  - Combined feedforward-feedback control using the idealized feedforward design.
* Evaluate both configurations for:
  - Setpoint tracking
  - Rejection of both input and output disturbances

1. Objective and Problem Statement

   * Clearly describe the purpose of combining feedforward and feedback control.
   * Briefly outline the process being controlled and its disturbance characteristics.

2. Methodology and Implementation

   * Describe how each control strategy (feedback-only and feedforward-feedback) was implemented in MATLAB Simulink.
   * Include screenshots of the Simulink models with relevant annotations.
   * Explain PID tuning and derivation of the feedforward controller.

3. Results

   * Show the system response for both control strategies under:

     * Setpoint tracking
     * Input and output disturbance rejection
   * Include well-labeled plots and relevant performance data.

4. Analysis and Discussion

   * Compare and interpret the performance of the two control strategies:
     feedback-only vs. combined feedforward-feedback.

   * Address the following points:
     - Does the addition of a feedforward controller improve setpoint tracking or disturbance rejection? Why?
     - How does the control system respond under ±10% process model mismatch?
     - Quantitatively assess and compare the performance (e.g., rise time,
       overshoot, IAE) of Feedback-only control, and feedback with idealized feedforward control

5. Conclusion

   * Summarize your key findings.
   * Reflect on the practical implications of your results.
