## Smooth operations: distillation column

::::{.columns}
:::{.column .pad width=50%}

* Distillation Column is an important unit in many chemical plants.

* **Objective**: To separate components based on differences in volatility,
   ensuring the desired purity of products.

* **Key Variables**: Temperature, pressure, reflux ratio, and feed composition.

* The column has several control objectives.

* Can you identify which control loop is related to smooth operation?

## Operating constraints

::::{.columns}
:::{.column .pad width=50%}

* Soft constraints
  - Can be violated during operation without compromising safety.
* Hard constraints
  - Physical limitations, such as maximum flow rates determined by valve sizes.
  - Constraints directly related to safety, which must never be violated.

* **Dealing with Process Constraints** is important to prevent accidents,
  unnecessary process disruptions, and loss in profit.

* **Conventional PID controllers** are NOT able to handle constraints.

* **Override Control Strategies** are used to deal with constraints.

## Operating constraints

![](../../../assets/images/vapor_liquid_separator_complete_control.png){width=50%}

- Which are hard constraints?
- Which are soft constraints?


## Limitations of conventional PID controllers

* **Measurement Deadtime:**
   - Delay between the process variable's actual change and the time it is measured.
   - Delayed corrective actions, leading to poor control and potential process upsets.

* **Process Nonlinearity:**
   - PID controllers are designed for linear systems, but many real-world processes exhibit nonlinearity.
   - Degraded control performance, oscillations, or instability in nonlinear processes.

* **Process Constraints:**
   - Physical or safety-related constraints that PID controllers are not inherently equipped to manage.
   - Risk of constraint violations, which can lead to safety hazards or equipment damage.

## Inferential control

* A control strategy that estimates (infers) unmeasured process variables based
  on other easily measurable variables and uses these estimates to maintain
  control of the process.

* Some critical variables are difficult or expensive to measure directly (e.g.,
  product composition, purity).

* Uses Easily Measured Process Variables (e.g., Temperature, Pressure, Flow Rate)
  - Mathematical models to more difficult-to-measure quantities such as
    compositions and molecular weight.

* Advantages

  - Reduces Analyzer Delay: Provides faster estimations, improving process
    responsiveness.
  - Cost-Effective: Significantly lowers both capital and operating costs
    compared to direct measurement systems.
  - Unique Measurements: Offers insights into variables that may be difficult
    or impossible to measure directly.


::: {.callout-note appearance='simple'}
* **Key Requirement**: The inferential measurement must correlate strongly with
  the controlled variable of interest to ensure accurate and reliable control.

## Choosing a proper tray temperature location

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}


![](../../../assets/images/tray_temp_location.png){width=90%}

:::
:::{.column .pad width=40%}

* A tray temperature used for inferential control should show strong sensitivity.

* Tray 10 is more sensitive $\Rightarrow$ change in % mol of propane clearly
  represented by T

* Tray 18 is not sensitive to change in % mol of propane $\Rightarrow$ change
  from 3.5% to 4% only leads to very small error signal in temperature

* Larger error signal generated in temperature $\Rightarrow$ more effective
  inferential T control of %mol of propane

![](../../../assets/images/comp_temp_correlation.png){width=90%}

:::
:::{.column .pad width=40%}

* Tray temperature for multicomponent distillation column as a function of the
  light key in the bottoms product for different ratios of heavy non-key to light
  non-key

* Feed composition affects the composition-temperature correlation.

* Tray temperature cannot represent the bottom composition well enough when
  feed composition heavily fluctuates

  disturbances

## Inferential Reactor Conversion Control

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}


![](../../../assets/images/packed_bed_reactor.png){width=40%}

:::
:::{.column .pad width=50%}

### Macroscopic energy balance

$$
X_A C_{A_{in}} (-\Delta H_{rxn}) = \rho C_p (T_{out} - T_{in})
$$

$$
X_A = \frac{ \rho C_p }{ C_{A_{in}} (-\Delta H_{rxn}) } (T_{out} - T_{in})
$$

* Develop linear relationship based on plant data

$$
X_A = a (T_{out} - T_{in}) + b
$$

* Temperature difference across the reactor must be large enough;
  - noise on the temperature measurement has a minimum effect on $X_A$
* Inlet composition and physical properties are constants, or do not change
  significantly.

  variable correlates with Nonlinear process changes

* Tune the controller at different levels, scheduling parameters; and combine
  the results so that the controller tuning parameters vary over the full
  operating range.

A nonscheduled controller that was tuned for v = 7 ft/sec after the feed rate is
changed to v = 4 ft/sec and a scheduled controller for the same upset.


## Override/select controls

::::{.columns}
:::{.column .pad width=40%}

* Process are many times operated at the safety or equipment limits in order to
  maximize process throughput

* During upset periods, it is essential that safety limits are enforced

* Override/Select control uses LS and HS action to change which controller is
  applied to the manipulated variable.

* Override/Select control uses selected action to switch between manipulated
  variables using the same control objective.

:::
:::{.column width=60%}

![](../../../assets/images/furnace_tube_temp_control.png){width=90%}

* Furnace tube temperature constraint control
  - Two T controls: Tube T; Process fluid T

* 𝑄 = 𝐴𝑈 ∆𝑇
  - Increase Fp (process flow) will increase Q
  
    ∆𝑇 = 𝑇~tube~ − 𝑇~p~

  - Tube temperature increase, it may violate maximum value, i.e. 500 C

## Tube temperature constraint controller

::::{.columns}
:::{.column .pad width=40%}

* Under normal operation,
  - Controller adjusts the furnace firing rate to maintain process stream at
    the setpoint temperature.
  - Process fluid outlet temperature control is selected

* At higher feed rates
  - Excessive tube temperatures can result in greatly reducing the useful life
    of the furnace tubes.
  - Tube temperature control selected

* The LS controller reduces the firing rate to ensure that the furnace tubes
  are not damaged.

## Column flooding constraint control

![Controllers - AC: bottom purity;  DPC: vapor
flow](../../../assets/images/column_flooding_constraint_control.png){width=90%
.pad}

* ΔP proportional to vapor flow. Higher ΔP means higher vapor flow across the
  trays. Too high vapor flow leads to column flooding – non smooth operation
  occur. To avoid flooding, implement DPC with LS controller.

* Under abnormal situation, e.g., sudden increase in feed rate, more steam is
  required. This can dramatically increase the vapor flow leading to flooding.
  DPC will prevent this from happening

## Analysis of override/select control – distillation column

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}
![Controllers - AC: bottom purity;  DPC: vapor
flow](../../../assets/images/column_flooding_constraint_control.png){width=90%
.pad}


:::

:::{.column .pad width=40%}

* When pressure drop across the column reaches an upper operational limit
  - Reboiler duty is switched from controlling; bottom product composition to
  maintaining operation at maximum pressure drop
* When the composition of the impurity in bottom product becomes less than
  setpoint (over purified),
  - Reboiler duty is switched from controlling at maximum pressure drop to
    maintaining composition of bottom product


:::
::::


## Controlling multiple constraints

![Controllers - AC: bottom purity;  TC: bottom temperature; DPC: vapor
flow](../../../assets/images/controlling_multiple_constraints.png){width=90%}

* DPC will be active if excessive vapor flow occurs under sudden increase in
  feed flow.

* TC is used to protect the reboiler from excessively high temperature. Under
  abnormal situation, e.g., sudden drop in feed temperature, a lot of steam is
  required to maintain the bottom purity. This may lead to violation of maximum
  tube temperature. TC is used to prevent this from happening.


## Hot spot temperature control

![](../../../assets/images/hotspot_temp_control.png){width=90% .pad}

* Can be used to control the maximum temperature in a fixed-bed reactor
* Maximum reactor temperature occurs at different locations in the reactor

## Cross-limiting firing controls

![](../../../assets/images/cross_limit_firing_control.png){width=90% .pad}


## Firing rate increase

![](../../../assets/images/cross_limit_firing_control_rate_increase.png){width=90% .pad}

* HS ensures setpoint for air flow controller increases immediately.
* Then LS sends signal to fuel controller as its setpoint.


## Firing rate decrease

![](../../../assets/images/cross_limit_firing_control_rate_decrease.png){width=90% .pad}

* LS ensures setpoint for fuel controller decreases immediately.
* Then HS sends the signal to air flow controller as its setpoint.


## Analysis of cross-limiting firing controls

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}
![](../../../assets/images/cross_limit_firing_control.png){width=90% .pad}

:::

:::{.column .pad width=40%}

* It is critical that excess oxygen is maintained during firing rate increases
  or decreases or CO will form.

* When the firing rate is increased, the air flow rate will lead
  the fuel flow rate.

* When the firing rate is decreased, the fuel flow rate will
  lead the air flow rate.

* Air flow rate controller is based on equivalent fuel flow rate (fuel/air
  ratio).

:::

## Override control

![](../../../assets/images/override_control.png){width=90% .pad}

* Select control to maintain bottom product purity when a maximum reboiler
  constraint is encountered.
* S selects the most critical stream in a cascade control loop.

## Summary

* Ensuring safe, smooth and profitable operation requires adequate control
  system in place.
* Where applicable, inferential control reduces deadtime at a
  very effective price.
* When process nonlinearity is serious, consider the
  scheduling controller tuning.
* Use override/select controls to satisfy safety and operational constraints. 
  - Control system must be able to deal with multiple constraints to ensure
    safe, smooth and profitable operation.
