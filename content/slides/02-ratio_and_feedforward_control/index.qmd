## Feedback control advantages

:::{.fragment}
- Corrective action occurs as soon as the controlled variable deviates from the
  set point, regardless of the source and type of disturbance.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Feedback control requires minimal knowledge about the process to be
  controlled; in particular, a mathematical model of the process is not
  required, although it can be very useful for control system design.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- The ubiquitous PID controller is both versatile and robust. If process
  conditions change, re-tuning the controller usually produces satisfactory
  control
:::

## Feedback control disadvantages

:::{.fragment}
- No corrective action is taken until after a deviation in the controlled
  variable occurs. Thus, perfect control, where the controlled variable does
  not deviate from the set point during disturbance or set-point changes, is
  theoretically impossible.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- It does not provide predictive control action to compensate for the effects
  of known or measurable disturbances.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- It may not be satisfactory for processes with large time constants and/or
  long time delays. If large and frequent disturbances occur, the process may
  operate continuously in a transient state and never attain the desired steady
  state.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- In some situations, the controlled variable cannot be measured on-line, so
  feedback control is not feasible.
:::

::::{.fragment}
:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}
For situations in which feedback control by itself is not satisfactory,
significant improvement can be achieved by adding feedforward control. But
feedforward control requires that the disturbances be measured (or estimated)
on-line. 
:::

## Introduction to feedforward control

- The basic concept of feedforward control is to measure important disturbance
  variables and take corrective action before they upset the process. 

- In contrast, a feedback controller does not take corrective action until
  after the disturbance has upset the process and generated a nonzero error
  signal.
