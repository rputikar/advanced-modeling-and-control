## Feedback control advantages

![](../../../assets/images/simple-feedback.png){width=90%}

:::{.fragment}
- Corrective action occurs as soon as the controlled variable deviates from the
  set point, regardless of the source and type of disturbance.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Feedback control requires minimal knowledge about the process to be
  controlled; in particular, a mathematical model of the process is not
  required, although it can be very useful for control system design.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- The ubiquitous PID controller is both versatile and robust. If process
  conditions change, re-tuning the controller usually produces satisfactory
  control
:::

## Feedback control disadvantages

:::{.fragment}
- No corrective action is taken until after a deviation in the controlled
  variable occurs. Thus, perfect control, where the controlled variable does
  not deviate from the set point during disturbance or set-point changes, is
  theoretically impossible.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- It does not provide predictive control action to compensate for the effects
  of known or measurable disturbances.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- It may not be satisfactory for processes with large time constants and/or
  long time delays. If large and frequent disturbances occur, the process may
  operate continuously in a transient state and never attain the desired steady
  state.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- In some situations, the controlled variable cannot be measured on-line, so
  feedback control is not feasible.
:::

::::{.fragment}
:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}
For situations in which feedback control by itself is not satisfactory,
significant improvement can be achieved by adding feedforward control. But
feedforward control requires that the disturbances be measured (or estimated)
on-line.

## Introduction to feedforward control

- The basic concept of feedforward control is to measure important disturbance
  variables and take corrective action before they upset the process. 

- In contrast, a feedback controller does not take corrective action until
  after the disturbance has upset the process and generated a nonzero error
  signal.

### Feedforward control


:::{.smaller}
*Advantages* 

- Acts before the disturbance reaches the process 
- Cannot cause instability 
- Good for slow process dynamics
:::


:::{.smaller}
*Disadvantages*

- Must identify and measure all disturbances 
- Fails for unmeasured disturbances 
- Relies on availability of process models 
- No indication of control quality

### Feedback control


:::{.smaller}
*Advantages*

- No disturbance measurements needed
- No process model necessary
- Can cope with changes within process
:::


:::{.smaller}
*Disadvantages*

- Will always have some transient error
- Poor for slow dynamics and interactions
- Instability is possible

## Ratio control

Ratio control is a special type of feedforward control
that has had widespread application in the process
industries. Its objective is to maintain the ratio of two
process variables at a specified value. The two variables
are usually flow rates, a manipulated variable u and a
disturbance variable d. Thus, the ratio u/d is controlled rather than
individual variables.

$$R := \frac{u}{d}$$ 


Typical applications 

(1) specifying the relative amounts of components in blending operations. 

(2) maintaining a stoichiometric ratio of reactants to a reactor. 

(3) keeping a specified reflux ratio for a distillation column.

(4) holding the fuel-air ratio to a furnace at the optimum value.

## Stability

- While feedback control is inherently stable due to its self-correcting
  nature, feedforward control requires careful consideration of system
  stability.

- Unstable behavior can arise in feedforward control systems due to modeling
  errors or incorrect estimation of disturbance effects.

- When combined with feedback control, the feedback loop can often correct
  these stability issues. However, if the feedforward control is dominant, it
  might destabilize the system.

- In the design phase, engineers should thoroughly test the system response to
  various disturbances to ensure stability.

## Tuning feedforward controllers

- Tuning a feedforward controller involves adjusting the gain and two time
  constants: lead and lag.

- The lead time constant helps the controller anticipate rapid changes, and the
  lag time constant allows it to respond to slow disturbances. Proper tuning
  ensures a balance between fast response and system stability.

- Tuning is often achieved through simulation or experimental methods.

- Gain scheduling can be used to adjust controller parameters based on system
  conditions.

- When combined with feedback control in a two-degree-of-freedom control
  structure, the feedback controller compensates for the feedforward
  controller's imperfections, ensuring overall system stability.
