## Cascade control

:::{.fragment}
- The feedback control configuration involves one measurement (output) and one
  manipulated variable in a single loop. 
:::

:::{.fragment}
- A disadvantage of conventional feedback control is that corrective action for
  disturbances does not begin until after the controlled variable deviates from
  the set point.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Feedforward control offers large improvements over feedback control for
  processes that have large time constants or time delays. 
:::

:::{.fragment}
- However, feedforward control requires that the disturbances be measured
  explicitly, and that a steady-state or dynamic model be available to
  calculate the controller output.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- An alternative approach that can significantly improve the dynamic response
  to disturbances employs a secondary measured variable and a secondary
  feedback controller.

In cascade control, we have **one** manipulated variable and more than one measurement.

## How Cascade Control Works?

:::{.fragment}
- Cascade control system consists of at least 2 controllers with 1 primary loop
  and 1 secondary loop. 
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Requires 2 measurements – 1 primary measurement and 1 secondary measurement
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Cascade control is primarily aimed to improve disturbance rejection or
  regulatory control performance.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Provides early compensation of input disturbance via the secondary controller.
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Key features:
  
  :::{.smaller}
  a) The disturbance must has an effect on the secondary measurement

  b) Causal (cause-and-effect) relationship between the secondary measurement
  and manipulated variable

  c) Causal relationship between the manipulated variable, and between
  secondary and primary measurements.

  d) Secondary loop must be faster than the primary loop

## Advantages and Disadvanteges

### Advantages
- Removes effects of disturbances and improves disturbance rejection performance
- Reduces the negative effect of process nonlinearity
- Improves control performance and stability of a process with long time-delay
- Uses traditional PID-type controllers

### Disadvantages
- Requires more than 1 measurements and sensors – increased cost
- More tuning parameters to handle – increased tuning task
- Potentially more wear and tear as the the inner loop is tuned aggressively

## Inner loop analysis

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=50%}
- Setpoint transfer function
  $$ H_{r2} = \frac{G_{C2} G_{P2}}{1 + G_{C2} G_{P2}} $$

- Characteristic equation
  $$1 + G_{C2} G_{P2}  = 0$$

  $$ 1 + \frac{K_{C2} K_{P2} e^{-\theta_2 s}}{\tau_2 s + 1} = 0 $$
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- Let Loop gain $K_{L2} = K_{C2} K_{P2}$

- Delay:  $e^{-\theta_2 s} \approxeq 1 - \theta_2 s$

- Characteristic Polynomial
  $$ \tau_2 s + 1 + K_{L2}(1 - \theta_2 s) = 0 $$

  $$
  \underbrace{\left(\tau_2-K_{L 2} \theta_2\right)}_{a_1} s+\underbrace{\left(1+K_{L 2}\right)}_{a_0}=0
  $$

:::
::::


## Inner loop analysis

- Necessary stability criterion: $a_1 > 0, a_0 > 0$

- Upper limit on the loop gain

  $$a_1 = \tau_2 - K_{L2}\theta_2 > 0 ; \therefore K_{L2} = \frac{\tau_2}{\theta_2}$$
  
- lower limit on the loop gain

  $$a_0 = 1 + K_{L2} > 0 ; \therefore K_{L2} > -1 $$
  
- Since the lower limit is negative, due to practical reason the minimum value
  of loop gain should be above 0 but lower than its upper limit. Thus, for
  stability the loop gain is given as

  $$ K_{L2} = R_{p2} \left( \frac{\tau_2}{\theta_2} \right); 0 < R_{p2} < 1 $$

- The  parameter $R_{P2}$ can be used to tune the controller gain
  as:  $K_{C2} = \frac{R_{p2}}{K_{p2}} \frac{\tau_2}{\theta_2}$


## Inner loop analysis

- Simplify the setpoint transfer function $H_{r2}$ as

$$
H_{r 2}=\frac{K_O \exp \left(-\theta_2 s\right)}{\tau_{c 2} s+1}; 
\text{where, }
K_o=\frac{K_{L 2}}{1+K_{L 2}}, \quad \tau_{c 2}=\frac{\tau_2}{1+K_{L 2}}
$$

- Notice that  $K_{L2} = R_{p2}\frac{\tau_2}{\theta_2}$

- Therefore, overall gain and closed-loop time constant can be written as
$$
K_o=\frac{R_{p2} \tau_2}{\theta_2 + R_{p2} \tau_2}; 
\tau_{c2} = \frac{\theta_2 \tau_2}{\theta_2 + R_{p2} \tau_2}
$$

:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}

To increase the speed of response of secondary controller, increase the value
of $R_{p2}$ but keep the value below 1 to ensure stability.

## Primary loop analysis

![](../../../assets/images/cascade-control-outer-loop.png){width=90%}

- Augmented primary process

$$
G_{p a}=H_{r 2} G_{p 1} \cong \frac{K_o K_{p 1} e^{-\left(\theta_1+\theta_2+\tau_{c 2}\right) s}}{\tau_1 s+1}
$$

-  $G_{pa}$ is used to design or tune the primary controller. This means that
  the secondary controller should be designed first, as the primary design
  depends on the $H_{r2}$.


## Primary loop analysis

- The effect of input disturbance is given by $H_{d2}$

  $$
  H_{d2} = \frac{K_{D0}}{\tau_{c2} s + 1}; 
  K_{D0} = \frac{1}{1 + K_{L2}} = \frac{\theta_2}{\theta_2 + R_{p2} \tau_2}
  $$

- Primary setpoint transfer function $H_{r1}$: 

  $$
  H_{r1} = \frac{ G_{c1} H_{r2} G_{p1}}{1 + G_{c1} H_{r2} G_{p1}} 
  $$

- Characteristic equation (CE): 

  $$
  1 + G_{c1} H_{r2} G_{p1} = 0;  
  1 + \frac{K_{c1} K_0 K_{p1} (\tau_I s + 1) e^{-\theta_t s}}
           { \tau_I s (\tau_1 s + 1)} = 0
  $$

  where, $\theta_t = \theta_1 + \theta_2 + \tau_{c2}$

## Primary loop analysis

- Let loop gain $K_{L1} = K_{C1} K_0 K_{p1}$ and $e^{-\theta_t s} \approxeq 1 - \theta_t s$

- Simplifying CE to polynomial

  $$
  \tau_I s (\tau_1 s + 1) + K_{L1} (\tau_I s + 1)(1 - \theta_t s) = 0
  $$

  $$
   \underbrace{\tau_I \left(\tau_1-K_{L 1} \theta_t\right)}_{a_2} s^2 
  +\underbrace{\tau_I + K_{L 1}\left(\tau_I - \theta_t\right)}_{a_1} s 
  +\underbrace{K_{L 1}}_{a_0}=0
  $$

- Necessary stability criterion requires $a_2 > 0, a_1 > 0$, and $a_0 > 0$

- These provide the limits for loop gain $K_{L1}$

- To ensure stability, the loop gain must be bounded between its minimum upper
  limit and maximum lower limit
  
- Provides tuning parameters for the controller

## Choice of Secondary Measured Variables

- There should be a well-defined relation between the primary and secondary
  measured variables.

- Essential disturbances should act in the inner loop.

- The inner loop should be faster than the outer loop. The typical rule of
  thumb is that the average residence times should have a ratio of at least
  five.

- It should be possible to have a high gain in the inner loop.
  

## Summary

- Cascade control can be used when there are several measurement signals and
  one control variable. 

- It is particularly useful when there are significant dynamics, e.g., long
  dead times or long time constants, between the control variable and the
  process variable. 

- Tighter control can then be achieved by using an intermediate measured signal
  that responds faster to the control signal.
