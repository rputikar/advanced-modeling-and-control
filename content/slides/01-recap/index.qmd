* Optimal process operations require [efficient and effective
  control]{.highlight}
* Control systems and advanced algorithms are deployed to monitor, regulate,
  and
  optimize the process variables.

## Control objectives

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

::: {.fragment}

### Safety First

- People
- Environment
- Equipment

### Profit

- meeting final product specifications
- minimizing waste production
- minimizing environmental impact
- minimizing energy use
- maximizing overall production rate

### Reducing variability

- Poor control requires set point far from constraint

  ::: {.smaller}
  Essential for training plant operators in complex units and emergencies

  Create a realistic training environment when connected to process control equipment
  :::

- Facilitating Evaluation of Control Strategies

  ::: {.smaller}
  Assist in identifying variables to be controlled and manipulated
  
  Aid in preliminary controller tuning

  Play an explicit role in model-based control strategies

- Theoretical models 
  
  ::: {.smaller}
  Developed using the principles of chemistry, physics,
  and biology.

  First principles models

  Mass, momentum, and heat balances

  :::
- Empirical models 

  ::: {.smaller}

  Obtained by fitting experimental data.

  Statistical models

  Correlations

  data driven models

  :::
  
- Semi-empirical/ hybrid models 

  ::: {.smaller}
  A combination of the theoretical and empirical models

  The numerical values of one or more of the parameters in a theoretical model
  are calculated from experimental data.
