## Importance of process analysis and control

* Chemical processes greatly influence every aspect of our life 
* [Sustainability]{.highlight} in the chemical process industry 
  - responsible resource utilization
  - minimizes environmental impact
  - long-term viability and competitiveness
* Optimal process operations require [efficient and effective control]{.highlight}
* Control systems and advanced algorithms are deployed to monitor, regulate, and
optimize the process variables.  

## Control objectives

### Safety First

- People
- Environment
- Equipment

### Profit

- meeting final product specifications
- minimizing waste production
- minimizing environmental impact
- minimizing energy use
- maximizing overall production rate

### Reducing variability

- Poor control requires set point far from constraint
