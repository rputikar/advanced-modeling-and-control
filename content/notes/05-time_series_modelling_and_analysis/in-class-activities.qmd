## Activities

1. Estimating Transfer Function Models for a Heat Exchanger

   In this example we estimate the transfer function for a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger consists of a coolant temperature, product temperature, and disturbance ambient temperature. We will estimate the coolant to product temperature transfer function.

   The measured data is stored in an excel file [heat_exchanger.xlsx](heat_exchanger.xlsx) and includes measurements of changes in coolant temperature around a nominal and changes in product temperature around a nominal. Estimate a transfer function for the heat exchanger. 

   1. From the physics of the problem we know that the heat exchanger can be described by a first order system with delay. Use the `tfest` command specifying one pole, no zeroes, and an unknown input/output delay to estimate a transfer function.
   
   2. The `compare` and `resid` commands allow us to investigate how well the estimated model matches the measured data.
      
   Detailed instructions are given [here](https://au.mathworks.com/help/ident/ug/estimating-transfer-function-models-for-a-heat-exchanger.html). 
   
2. **AR model**: Australia COVID-19 Infection

   The cumulative daily data for COVID-19 infections is given in [Australia_covid_cases.xlsx](Australia_covid_cases.xlsx). Fit an autoregression model to the data. 

3. For the transfer function below, develop an ARX model for the above system, with 1 unit step change in input and sampling time Ts = 1 unit. 
   
   $$
   G_p = \frac{ 2 exp (-s)}{(10s + 1)}
   $${#eq-p3}

4. **Iron ore prices**: The price history for iron ore spot prices is given in [iron_ore.xlsx](iron_ore.xlsx). 

   Use the following Matlab functions
   1. `arima(p,d,q)` => to build ARIMA model
   2. `estimate(Mdl,X)` => to estimate the ARMA model parameters
   3. `simulate(EstMdl,t)` => to simulate the ARMA model
   4. `plot(tx,X,tx,y)` = > to compare the data and model estimation

5. Follow the [Building and Estimating Process Models Using System Identification Toolbox](https://au.mathworks.com/help/ident/ug/building-and-estimating-process-models-using-system-identification-toolbox.html) example from Matlab documentation.
