## Activities

### Single-layer perceptron neural network

In a chemical processing plant, a critical valve is controlled based on three
parameters: temperature, pressure, and reactant concentration, all within
normalized ranges. Each parameter is represented as a binary input: 1 if the
parameter is within the desired range, indicating favorable conditions for
opening the valve, and 0 if it is outside the range, indicating unfavorable
conditions. The decision to open the valve depends on these inputs to ensure
safe and efficient operation.


- Scenario 1: Low temperature, low pressure, optimal concentration.
- Scenario 2: Optimal temperature, optimal pressure, optimal concentration.
- Scenario 3: Optimal temperature, low pressure, optimal concentration.
- Scenario 4: Low temperature, optimal pressure, optimal concentration.

: Expected valve position 

| Temperature | Pressure  | Concentration | Valve Opens |
|-|-|-|-|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

Design a simple single-layer perceptron using MATLAB to learn this
decision-making process based on the input parameters.


### ANN modeling of Crystallization

Average crystal size is one of the important parameters to be controlled in a
crystallization process. The average crystal size is affected by two measured
variables:

1. Mother liquor temperature $T$
2. Mother liquor density $\rho$

Note that average crystal size cannot be measured directly and has to be
measured offline in a laboratory. This can introduce significant delays for
control of the crystallizer. 

Build a model to predict the size using Temperature ($T$) and density ($\rho$)
measurements

The temperature and density depend on feed flow rate and stirrer speed. 

Use following modelling information: 

1. Input transfer functions

	a. Feed flow rate (U~1~)

	$$ U_1(s) = \frac{1}{s + 1} $${#eq-1}

	b. Stirrer Speed (U~2~)
	
	$$ U_2(s) = \frac{1}{2 s + 1} $${#eq-2}
		
2. Process Transfer functions

	a. Temperature (X~1~) (based on U~1~)
	
	$$ X_1(s) = \left( \frac{2}{ 3 s + 1} + \frac{ - 0.2 }{ 2 s^2 + 1.1 s + 1}
	\right) e^{-s} $${#eq-3}
		
	b. Density (X~2~) (based on U~2~)
	
	$$ X_2(s) = \frac{ e^{-s}}{ 4 s^2 + 3 s + 1} $${#eq-4}
		
3. Dependency of average crystal size d~avg~ (Y) on temperature and density

$$ d_{avg} = 0.8 T + 1.3 \rho + 1.1 T^2 - 1.9 \rho^2 + 0.6 T \rho $${#eq-5}
