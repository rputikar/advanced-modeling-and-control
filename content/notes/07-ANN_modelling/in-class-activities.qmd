## Activities

1. ANN modeling of Crystallization

Average crystal size is one of the important parameters to be controlled in a crystallization process. The average crystal size is affected by two measured variables:

1. Mother liquor temperature 𝑇
2. Mother liquor density 𝜌

Note that average crystal size cannot be measured directly and has to be measured offline in a laboratory. This can introduce significant delays for control of the crystallizer. 

Build a model to predict the size using Temperature (𝑇) and density (𝜌) measurements

The temperature and density depend on feed flow rate and stirrer speed. 

Use following modelling information: 

1. Input transfer functions

	a. Feed flow rate (U~1~)
	
		$$
		U_1(s) = \frac{1}{s + 1}
		$${#eq-1}
	
	b. Stirrer Speed (U~2~)
		
		$$
		U_2(s) = \frac{1}{2 s + 1}
		$${#eq-2}
		
2. Process Transfer functions

	a. Temperature (X~1~) (based on U~1~)
	
		$$
		X_1(s) = \left(
			    \frac{2}{ 3 s + 1} + 
			    \frac{ - 0.2 }{ 2 s^2 + 1.1 s + 1}
			   \right) e^{-s}
		$${#eq-3}
		
	b. Density (X~2~) (based on U~2~)
		
		$$
		X_2(s) = \frac{ e^{-s}}{ 4 s^2 + 3 s + 1}
		$${#eq-4}
		
3. Dependency of average crystal size d~avg~ (Y) on temperature and density

	$$
	d_{avg} = 0.8 T + 1.3 \rho + 1.1 T^2 - 1.9 \rho^2 + 0.6 T \rho
	$${#eq-5}
