## Example 15.1 from [@seborg2016]

A ratio control scheme is to be used to maintain a stoichiometric ratio of
H~2~ and N~2~ as the feed to an ammonia synthesis reactor [@fig-nh3-synthesis]. Individual
flow controllers will be used for both the H~2~ and N~2~ streams.
Using the information given below,

(a) Draw a schematic diagram for the ratio control scheme.
(b) Specify the appropriate gain for the ratio station, $K_R$.

### Available information:
i. The electronic flow transmitters have built-in square root extractors. The
spans of the flow transmitters are 30 L/min for H~2~ and 15 L/min for
N~2~.

ii. The control valves have pneumatic actuators.

iii. Each required current-to-pressure (I/P) transducer has a gain of 0.75
psi/mA.

iv. The ratio station is an electronic instrument with 4â€“20 mA input and output
signals.
