## Activities

1. Consider a boiler drum as shown in the figure below

:::

   a. Identify controlled variable, manipulated variable and disturbance

   b. Draw a conventional feedback control to maintain liquid level in the
   boiler.

   c. What are the drawbacks of this system?

2. Consider the operation of heat exchanger to demonstrate the application of
   feedforward control strategy. Identify all disturbances and the target
   disturbance to be remove using the feedforward control strategy

![Blending system](../../../assets/images/blending-schematic.png){#fig-blend-system}

:::

  a. Identify controlled variable

  b. Manipulated variable

  c. Disturbance

  d. Propose a feedforward strategy to control outlet composition

  e. Propose a strategy to control composition when inlet flowrate $w_2$ is fluctuating 

  f. propose a feedforward feedback control strategy


4. The process, and disturbance transfer functions for problem 1 are given by

   $$G_p(s)= \frac{0.1 e^{-s}}{2.5s + 1}$${#eq-2-gp} 
   $$G_d(s)=\frac{0.5 e^{-s}}{2.5s + 1}$${#eq-2-gd}

   use PID tuner app to tune a PID controller for this process.

5. Propose a feedforward control system for [@fig-boiler-drum].
   Explain how a feedforward control can improve disturbance rejection or
   regulatory control performance.

6. Calculate ideal feedforward compensator for Problem 2 and implement pure
   feedforward control scheme in simulink.

7. Draw a combined feedforward-feedback PID for [@fig-boiler-drum]. Implement
   feedforward-feedback system in simulink. 

8. Consider the following process and disturbance transfer functions:

   $$ \text { Process: } G_p(s)=\frac{2 \exp (-4 s)}{15 s+1} $${#eq-7-gp}

   $$ \text{Disturbance: }G_d(s)=\frac{5 \exp (-2 s)}{30 s+1} $${#eq-7-gd}

   Do the following: 

   i.	For the process given above, can an idealized feedforward controller be
   used to reject the disturbance. 

   ii.	Obtain a feedforward controller and PID controller for the process
   above using the unified feedforward-feedback control method.

9. [Ratio control for ammonia synthesis reactor](./ammonia_synthesis_reactor.qmd).  

10. Furnace ratio control [@fig-furnace]

    Draw the schematic of a ratio control strategy. What is the target
    disturbance? What is the manipulated variable? What is the controlled
    variable?

    solution to maintain the pH of the effluent.
