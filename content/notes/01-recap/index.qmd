## Importance of process analysis and control

Chemical processes greatly influence every aspect of our life. All important
industrial sector such as food production, water treatment, healthcare and
pharmaceuticals, energy, automotives, and so on rely on chemical process
industry to supply ingradients, raw materials, and enabling technologies. In
recent years, significant attention is given to sustainability in the chemical
process industry. New processes and retrofit of existing processes are based on
responsible resource utilization, minimization of environmental impact, and
considerations to long-term viability and competitiveness. Chemical processes
involve several unit operations, such as mixing, heat exchange, mass transfer,
and reaction. In a chemical process, required unit operations are performed in
a specific sequence to achieve specific objectives. In order to ensure optimal
operations of the process it is important to have efficient and effective
control over process variables such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, and
composition. Optimal operations are crucial for maintaining safety, and
achieving desired product quality. Control systems and advanced algorithms are
deployed to monitor, regulate, and optimize the process variables.  

Controlling processes involves influencing their operation to achieve desired
outcomes. This is accomplished through the use of control units, which regulate
and guide processes to maintain steady operation and prevent deviations from
target conditions. It is important to recognize that all industrial processes
are dynamic, meaning their behavior changes over time. Control engineers must
have a deep understanding of process dynamics and develop suitable mechanisms
to influence and manage their behavior effectively.

Control engineering is an integral part of chemical engineering. Design
engineers must account for dynamic operation and its consequences, while plant
operators must respond to disruptions for smooth operation. Experimental
engineers rely on process control for precise conditions. Without process
control, modern processing facilities cannot operate safely, reliably, and
profitably while meeting quality and environmental standards.

## Process control objectives

### Process System, Input and Output A process system refers to a collection of
interconnected components and equipment that work together to transform inputs
into desired outputs in industrial or chemical processes. 

Several key terms define the components of a control system, including
Manipulated Variables (MV), Controlled Variables (CV), disturbances, and
unmeasured outputs.

1. **Manipulated Variables (MV):** These are the inputs that a control system
   can adjust to influence the process. For example, in a heating system, the
   fuel supply to the burner could be a manipulated variable; the control
   system can increase or decrease the fuel supply to control the system.

2. **Controlled Variables (CV):** These are the outputs of the process that the
   control system aims to regulate. The control system adjusts the MVs to keep
   the CVs at their desired levels, known as setpoints. In the heating system
   example, the temperature of the room would be the controlled variable. 

3. **Disturbances:** These are factors that can influence the CV but are not
   controllable by the system. They can be measurable or unmeasurable. In the
   heating system example, a disturbance could be the outside temperature. If
   it's cold outside, it might cause the room temperature (CV) to decrease, so
   the control system needs to adjust the fuel supply (MV) to maintain the
   desired room temperature.

4. **Unmeasured Outputs:** These are the outputs of the process that are not
   directly controlled or measured, but may still be of interest. These could
   include quantities like efficiency, product quality, or environmental
   emissions. Because they are not directly measured, their values may need to
   be inferred from other variables or estimated using a process model.

Let's consider a tank that's used to store a liquid. The objective is to
maintain the level of the liquid in the tank at a desired value. For this
system MV, CV, disturbances, and unmeasured output can be identified as below. 

![liquid level in a
tank](../../../assets/images/liquid-level-tank-example.png){#fig-liquid-level-tank
width=60%}

1. Manipulated Variable (MV): The flow rate of the liquid into or out of the
   tank. By increasing or decreasing the flow rate, the control system can
   regulate the level of the liquid.

2. Controlled Variable (CV): The level of the liquid in the tank. The control
   system measures the level and compares it to the setpoint, and then adjusts
   the manipulated variable (flow rate).

3. Disturbances: Changes in inlet flow rate, changes in outlet flow rate,
   temperature variations, pressure fluctuations, or any other factors that can
   impact the liquid level.

4. Unmeasured Output: An example of an unmeasured output could be the
   temperature of the liquid in the tank. While the control system may not
   directly measure the temperature, changes in temperature can affect the
   liquid's density and, in turn, impact the level control dynamics. The
   control system must consider such unmeasured outputs and adjust the control
   strategy accordingly.


### Implicit and explicit control objectives Both implicit and explicit control
objectives refer to the desired outcomes or goals for a system's performance.
They provide the framework for designing and tuning control systems.

**Explicit Control Objectives**

Explicit control objectives are clearly defined and typically quantifiable
goals for the performance of a control system. These objectives are explicitly
stated and usually include desired system responses such as stability, speed of
response, minimal overshoot, accuracy, and robustness to disturbances. They may
also include compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Explicit
control objectives form the basis of the formal design and analysis of control
systems [@seborg2016].

Some examples of explicit objectives are given below:

1. **Setpoint Tracking:** The control system should be able to maintain a
   process variable (such as temperature, pressure, or flow rate) at a desired
   setpoint. For example, a temperature control system in a reactor might have
   an explicit objective to maintain the temperature at 175°C.

2. **Disturbance Rejection:** The control system should be able to minimize the
   impact of disturbances on the process variable. For example, if a
   disturbance causes the temperature in a reactor to increase, the control
   system should bring it back to the setpoint as quickly and smoothly as
   possible.

3. **Stability:** The control system should maintain stability in the face of
   disturbances or setpoint changes. This means that it should not induce
   oscillations or lead to runaway conditions.

4. **Speed of Response:** The control system should achieve its control
   objectives quickly. This involves minimizing the rise time (the time it
   takes for the process to go from 10% to 90% of the final value) and settling
   time (the time it takes for the process to settle within a certain
   percentage of the final value).

5. **Overshoot Minimization:** When a setpoint change or disturbance occurs,
   the system should minimize overshoot, which is the extent to which the
   process variable exceeds the final value.

6. **Regulatory Compliance:** The control system should ensure that the process
   meets any applicable regulatory requirements. For instance, a control system
   for an industrial waste treatment process might have an explicit objective
   to maintain pollutant concentrations below regulatory limits.

**Implicit Control Objectives**

Implicit control objectives are usually not explicitly stated or quantified,
but are understood to be desirable or necessary. Implicit objectives are often
evaluated qualitatively, and they can have a significant impact on the
long-term success of a control system. While explicit control objectives
usually take precedence, implicit control objectives play a crucial role in the
successful implementation and operation of control systems [@luyben1990].

Examples of implicit control objectives include:

1. **Simplicity:** The control system should be as simple as possible, making
   it easy to understand, implement, and maintain. For instance, a PID
   controller might be preferred over a more complex control strategy for a
   relatively simple process.

2. **Reliability:** The control system should operate reliably under normal and
   abnormal conditions. This could involve factors like hardware reliability,
   software robustness, and fault tolerance.

3. **Cost-effectiveness:** The cost of implementing and maintaining the control
   system should be reasonable. This includes not only the cost of hardware and
   software but also the cost of any downtime caused by control system issues.

4. **Safety:** While safety is often an explicit objective, it can also be an
   implicit goal in the sense that all control systems should inherently
   contribute to safe operation. This includes avoiding dangerous conditions
   and responding appropriately to emergency situations.

5. **Flexibility:** The control system should be adaptable to changes in the
   process or operating conditions. This could include the ability to handle
   different operating modes or the ability to be easily updated or
   reconfigured.

6. **Scalability:** The control system should be capable of handling increases
   in process size or complexity without a significant degradation in
   performance.

### Implicit control objectives of process control
 
Control systems play a crucial role in ensuring safe and profitable operation
of processes involving various streams. These control systems continuously
monitor process variables such as temperature, pressure, level, flow, and
concentration. They take actions, such as adjusting valves, controlling pump
speed, and regulating heaters, to maintain these variables at specified set
point values defined by operators. This enables processes to operate
efficiently, meeting desired objectives while prioritizing safety and
profitability.

The primary objective of any control system is safety. Control systems are
designed to ensure the safety of people, protect the environment, and safeguard
equipment. By continuously monitoring and adjusting process variables, these
systems can detect and respond to deviations or disturbances that may pose
risks or compromise the integrity of the system. This proactive approach to
safety helps prevent accidents, minimize environmental impact, and preserve the
longevity of equipment.

When faced with competing objectives, the specific tradeoff considerations vary
depending on the industry, scale, and potential consequences involved. For
example, In extreme scenarios such as a nuclear plant, the control system may
shut down the operations to prevent potential deadly radiation leaks. On the
other hand, in power or chemical industry, there is a tradeoff between
controlling emissions and equipment safety. In order to keep the operations
running optimally, the control system may deviate from the emission norms
occasionally. Stricter emission control measures, may place additional stress
on equipment and require diligent maintenance to ensure safe operation.
Balancing emissions control with equipment safety becomes crucial to mitigate
environmental harm while ensuring the integrity and reliability of the
industrial process.

In addition to safety, automatic control also enhances efficiency and
performance. By maintaining process variables at optimal set points, these
systems enable processes to operate at peak efficiency, reduce energy
consumption, improve product quality, and increase overall productivity. This
not only maximizes output and profitability but also contributes to
sustainability efforts by minimizing resource wastage and emissions.

After ensuring the people, environment, and equipment safety objectives are
met, the control objectives can focus on the profit. 

Plant-level control objectives motivated by profit include:

- meeting final product specifications
- minimizing waste production minimizing environmental impact minimizing energy
  use maximizing overall production rate

Process control plays a vital role in reducing variability :::

### Control and Optimization

Both control and optimization share the common goal of improving the
performance of a system, but they focus on different aspects and are used in
different contexts.

Control involves adjusting an input variable to maintain an output variable at
a desired value. This is accomplished using a control strategy, which
continually measures the output, compares it with the desired value, and
adjusts the input to minimize the difference or error between the desired value
and output. Control is a dynamic process that occurs in real time. It's
primarily concerned with maintaining stability, reducing variability, and
reacting to disturbances in the system.

On the other hand, optimization involves finding the best possible value of an
output or set of outputs. In the context of process control, optimization often
involves determining the best setpoint that will maximize or minimize a certain
objective function (such as profit, energy usage, or waste production).

Optimization is often a higher-level task that takes place over a longer
timeframe. The optimization of process operating conditions aims to maximize
economic objectives, such as annual profit. Effective plant management involves
determining desirable operating targets and implementing an efficient automatic
control strategy to maintain these targets within acceptable limits. Chemical
engineers are well-suited for setting control objectives as they possess a
clear understanding of how the plant operates.

To identify the most desirable operating conditions, the feasible region of
operation is defined based on the physical limits of decision variables. Plant
economics are then evaluated by assessing increasing profit contours. While the
optimum operating point often lies at a corner of the feasible region,
practical considerations and plant disturbances necessitate operating at a
slight distance from this point to ensure feasible operation
(@fig-optimal-plant-operations).

The control strategy focuses on minimizing variations around the operating
target and reducing the acceptable operating limits. Advanced control systems
offer the potential for operating even closer to the optimal target, resulting
in increased profitability. This improvement, quantified by a shift towards a
more profitable regime, demonstrates the financial benefits of the control
system.

## Hirarchy of process control activities

The hierarchy of process control activities is shown in
@fig-control-activity-hirarchy. 

### Measurement and Actuation (Level 1)

  Instrumentation, which includes sensors and transmitters, is used to measure
  variables in a process. Actuation equipment, such as control valves, is
  employed to carry out the control actions determined by these measurements.
  In essence, measurement and actuation functions are fundamental components of
  any control system, as they enable the system to gather data about the
  process and respond accordingly to maintain optimal conditions or meet set
  parameters.

### Safety and environmental/ equipment protection (Level 2)

  Level 2 functions are essential in ensuring both the safety of the process
  and its compliance with environmental regulations. As discussed in Chapter
  10, the approach to process safety involves the establishment of multiple
  layers of protection, consisting of various equipment and human actions. 

  A layer of this protection includes process control functions, like managing
  alarms during unusual situations and utilizing safety instrumented systems
  for emergency shutdowns. The safety gear, which encompasses sensors and
  control valves, functions independently of the standard instrumentation used
  for regulatory control in Level 3a.

  Methods for validating sensor functionality can be utilized to verify that
  these sensors are operating correctly.

### Regulatory control (Level 3a)

  The successful operation of a process requires that critical process
  variables, such as flow rates, temperatures, pressures, and compositions, are
  managed at or near their specified set points. This activity, known as
  regulatory control, is achieved by applying standard feedback and feedforward
  control techniques. 

  However, if these conventional control methods are not sufficient, a range of
  advanced control techniques is at our disposal. In recent times, there's been
  an increasing interest in the performance monitoring of control systems.

### Multivariable and constraint control (Level 3b)

  Many challenging process control issues have two key characteristics: they
  involve significant interactions among important process variables and they
  have inequality constraints for manipulated and controlled variables. These
  constraints, which include upper and lower limits, could be based on the
  capabilities of equipment or operational objectives for the process.

  Operating a process near a constraint limit is a significant goal for
  advanced process control. In many industrial operations, optimal conditions
  are often at the constraint limit. However, the set point should not be the
  constraint value to prevent surpassing the limit due to disturbances.
  Therefore, it's critical to set a conservative set point depending on the
  control system's capacity to minimize disturbances.

  Standard process control techniques might not be sufficient for managing
  complex control problems that involve severe process interactions and
  inequality constraints. In such cases, advanced control methods should be
  considered, including multivariable control and constraint control.
  Specifically, the model predictive control (MPC) strategy is designed to
  handle process interactions and inequality constraints.

### Real time optimization (Level 4)

  The optimal operating conditions for a plant are established during the
  process design phase. However, during the operation of the plant, these
  conditions can frequently change due to variations in equipment availability,
  process disturbances, and economic circumstances such as changes in raw
  material costs and product prices. As a result, it can be highly beneficial
  to frequently recalculate the optimal operating conditions. This activity,
  known as real-time optimization (RTO), involves implementing new optimal
  conditions as set points for controlled variables.

  The RTO calculations are based on a steady-state model of the plant and
  economic data like costs and product values. The usual objective of the
  optimization is to either minimize operating costs or maximize operating
  profits. RTO calculations can be conducted for an individual process unit or
  for the whole plant.

  Level 4 activities also incorporate data analysis to confirm the accuracy of
  the process model used in the RTO calculations under current conditions.
  Therefore, data reconciliation techniques can be utilized to ensure that
  steady-state mass and energy balances are met. Additionally, the process
  model can be updated using parameter estimation techniques and recent plant
  data.

### Planning and scheduling (Level 5) 

  The highest tier of the process control hierarchy is focused on strategizing
  and orchestrating operations for the entire plant. For continuous processes,
  the production rates of all products and intermediates need to be planned and
  harmonized. This involves considering equipment limitations, storage
  capacity, sales forecasts, and the operations of other plants, which can
  sometimes be globally distributed.

  For the intermittent operation of batch and semi-batch processes, production
  control transforms into a batch scheduling issue, guided by similar
  considerations. Hence, planning and scheduling tasks present challenging
  optimization problems that are founded on both engineering factors and
  business forecasts.

## Overview of control system design

Control System Design of a plant involves two parts, namely, control structure
design, and controller algorithm design.

### Control Structure Design

The first step in designing a control system for a plant is defining the
control structure. This includes deciding which variables to control
(Controlled Variables, CVs), which variables to adjust (Manipulated Variables,
MVs), and the structure that links these two sets of variables.

1. **Controlled Variables (CVs):** These are the variables that the control
   system aims to maintain at a certain level or setpoint. In a chemical
   reactor, for instance, you might want to control the temperature, pressure,
   or concentration of a certain species. The selection of CVs depends on the
   objectives of the process, such as product quality, safety, or environmental
   compliance.

2. **Manipulated Variables (MVs):** These are the variables that the control
   system can adjust to influence the CVs. In a reactor, these could include
   the flow rate of the reactants, the cooling rate, or the stirring speed. The
   selection of MVs depends on their influence on the CVs and their
   controllability.

3. **Structure Linking CVs and MVs:** Once the CVs and MVs are selected, the
   next step is to decide how they should be linked. In a single-loop control
   system, each CV is paired with one MV. In more complex systems, you might
   use multivariable control strategies where each MV can influence multiple
   CVs and vice versa. The structure should be designed to achieve the best
   control performance while considering practical aspects such as equipment
   limitations and interaction between variables.

### Controller Algorithm Design

Once the control structure is defined, the next step is to design the control
algorithm. This involves selecting the type of controller and tuning its
parameters.

1. **Controller Type:** This could be a simple PID
   (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, which is widely used in the
   industry due to its simplicity and effectiveness. For more complex systems,
   advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) might be
   used. The selection of controller type depends on the complexity of the
   process, the required performance, and the available resources.

2. **Controller Tuning:** This involves adjusting the parameters of the
   controller to achieve the best control performance. For a PID controller,
   this includes the proportional, integral, and derivative gains. For an MPC
   controller, this might involve tuning the prediction and control horizons,
   weights in the cost function, and model parameters.


### Model based control

Model-based control represents a significant advancement in control engineering
and has become increasingly important due to the growing complexity of systems
and the need for improved performance. In model-based control, a mathematical
model of the process is used to predict future outputs and decide on control
actions. This approach allows for optimal control decisions, the handling of
constraints, and the accommodation of system nonlinearity and multivariable
interactions. 

The major steps involved in designing and installing a control system using the
model-based approach are shown in the flow chart of @fig-major-steps. The first
step, formulation of the control objectives, is a critical decision. The
formulation is based on the operating objectives for the plants and the process
constraints. For example, in the distillation column control problem, the
objective might be to regulate a key component in the distillate stream, the
bottoms stream, or key components in both streams. An alternative would be to
minimize energy consumption (e.g., reboiler heat duty) while meeting product
quality specifications on one or both product streams. The inequality
constraints should include upper and lower limits on manipulated variables,
conditions that lead to flooding or weeping in the column, and product impurity
levels. After the control objectives have been formulated, a dynamic model of
the process is developed. The dynamic model can have a theoretical basis, for
example, physical and chemical principles such as conservation laws and rates
of reactions, or the model can be developed empirically from experimental data.
If experimental data are available, the dynamic model should be validated, and
the model accuracy is characterized. This latter information is useful for
control system design and tuning. The next step in the control system design is
to devise an appropriate control strategy that will meet the control objectives
while satisfying process constraints. As indicated in @fig-major-steps, this
design activity is both an art and a science. Process understanding and the
experience and preferences of the design team are key factors. Computer
simulation of the controlled process is used to screen alternative control
strategies and to provide preliminary estimates of appropriate controller
settings. Finally, the control system hardware and instrumentation are
selected, ordered, and installed in the plant. Then the control system is tuned
in the plant using the preliminary estimates from the design step as a starting
point. Controller tuning usually involves trial-and-error procedures.

## Introduction to process modeling

Dynamic models are crucial in the field of process dynamics and control.

- They enhance process understanding by allowing the study of transient
  behavior without disrupting the actual process. Through computer simulations,
  we can gain valuable insights into both dynamic and steady-state process
  behaviors, providing useful information even before a plant is constructed.

- Process simulators are indispensable for training plant operators to manage
  complex units and emergency situations. When connected to process control
  equipment, these simulators create a realistic training environment, much
  like flight simulators in the aviation industry. This helps operators build
  practical skills and respond effectively to challenging situations.

- A dynamic process model assists in evaluating various control strategies by
  pinpointing the variables to be controlled and manipulated. It can also help
  in preliminary controller tuning and in the application of empirical models
  before the plant's start-up. In strategies based on model control, the
  process model explicitly participates in the formulation of the control law,
  resulting in more efficient control implementation.

- Periodically recalculating optimum operating conditions can prove beneficial
  in maximizing profit or reducing costs in a process. By using a steady-state
  process model and economic data, the most profitable operating conditions can
  be identified. This approach allows for optimization and continuous
  enhancement of process performance.

## Types of process models (empirical, mechanistic, etc.)

Models can be classified as:

- Theoretical models are developed using the principles of chemistry, physics,
  and biology.
- Empirical models are obtained by fitting experimental data.
- Semi-empirical models are a combination of the models in categories (a) and
  (b); the numerical values of one or more of the parameters in a theoretical
  model are calculated from experimental data.

## Basic principles of mass and energy balances

- In general

  $$ \text{accumulation} = \text{in} - \text{out} - \text{reaction} -
  \text{tranfer} $$ {#eq-gen_bal}

- Mass balance (without reaction and transfer)

  $$ \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of mass} \\ \text {accumulation}
  \end{array}\right\} = \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of} \\ \text {mass
  in} \end{array}\right\}
  - \left\{\begin{array}{c}
    \text {rate of} \\ \text {mass out} \end{array}\right\} $$ {#eq-mass_bal}


- For component _i_ (with reaction term included) 

  $$ \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of} \\ \text {component i} \\ \text
  {accumulation} \end{array}\right\} = \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of}
  \\ \text {component i} \\ \text {in} \end{array}\right\}
    - \left\{\begin{array}{c}
      \text {rate of} \\ \text {componenti } \\ \text {out} \end{array}\right\}
    + \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of} \\ \text {component i} \\ \text
      {produced} \end{array}\right\} $$ {#eq-component_bal}

## Basic principles of mass and energy balances

- Energy balance

$$ \begin{aligned} \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text { rate of energy } \\ \text {
accumulation } \end{array}\right\} &= \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text { rate of
energy in } \\ \text { by convection } \end{array}\right\} \\ &

## Blending of two components

width=60%}

- Overall mass balance 

  $$ \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of accumulation} \\ \text {of mass in
  the tank} \end{array}\right\} = \left\{\begin{array}{c} \text {rate of} \\
  \text {mass in} \end{array}\right\}
  - \left\{\begin{array}{c}
    \text {rate of} \\ \text {mass out} \end{array}\right\} $$
    {#eq-blend_mass_bal_verbose}

  $$ \frac{d(V \rho)}{dt} = w_1 + w_2 - w $$ {#eq-blend_mass_bal}

- Component balance

  $$ \frac{d(V \rho x)}{dt} = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 - w x $$
  {#eq-blend_component_bal}

It is possible to further simplify the system of two differential equations to 

$$ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{\rho}\left(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 - w x\right) $$
{#eq-blend_1}

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{w_1}{V \rho} \left(x_1 - x\right)+ \frac{w_2}{V \rho}
\left(x_2 - x\right) $$ {#eq-blend_2}


## Degrees of freedom (DOF) analysis 

To simulate a process, it's crucial to confirm that the model equations, both
differential and algebraic, form a set of relations that can be solved. In
simple terms, we need to ensure that the output variables (usually those on the
left side of the equations) can be determined based on the input variables
(those on the right side of the equations). For instance, consider a set of
linear algebraic equations represented as **y = Ax**. To have a unique solution
for **x**, vectors **x** and **y** need to have the same number of elements and
matrix **A** should be nonsingular, meaning it has a nonzero determinant.

For large, complex steady-state or dynamic models, evaluating such a condition
is not straightforward. However, a general requirement exists: for the model to
have a unique solution, the count of unknown variables should match the number
of independent model equations. In other words, all available degrees of
freedom must be taken into account. The number of degrees of freedom,
represented as $N_F$, can be determined using a particular expression.

$$N_F = N_V - N_E$$ {#eq-dof}

where $N_V$ is the total number of process variables (distinct from constant
process parameters) and $N_E$ is the number of independent equations.

A degrees of freedom analysis allows modeling problems to be classified
according to the following categories:

1. $N_F = 0$: The process model is exactly specified. If $NF = 0$, then the
   number of equations is equal to the number of process variables and the set
   of equations has a solution. (However, the solution may not be unique for a
   set of nonlinear equations.)

2. $N_F > 0$: The process is underspecified. If $N_F > 0$, then $N_V > N_E$, so
   there are more process variables than equations. Consequently, the $N_E$
   equations have an infinite number of solutions, because NF process variables
   can be specified arbitrarily.

3. $N_F < 0$: The process model is overspecified. For $N_F < 0$, there are
   fewer process variables than equations, and consequently the set of
   equations has no solution.

### DOF for the blending problem

- Parameters (2): $V, \rho$
- Variables ($N_V = 4): $x, x_1, x_2, w_1, w_1$
- equation ($N_E = 1$): @eq-blend_mass_bal

The degrees of freedom are calculated as $N_F = 4 − 1 = 3$. Thus, we must
identify three input variables that can be specified as known functions of time
in order for the equation to have a unique solution. The dependent variable $x$
is an obvious choice for the output variable in this simple example.
Consequently, we have

- output (1): $x$
- inputs (3): $x_1, w_1, w_2$

Because all of the degrees of freedom have been utilized, the single equation
is exactly specified and can be solved.

## Linearization of process models

Chemical processes often present nonlinear characteristics, leading to the
creation of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the
modeling methods discussed in Chapter 4. However, these models can be complex
and challenging, particularly when it comes to finding closed-form or
analytical solutions. In addition, as we've seen in Chapter 3, straightforward
input-output (I/O) representations can be highly beneficial for control
engineers, making the control problem more discernible and aiding in the
formulation of effective solutions.

Over time, control theory has evolved with a strong focus on linear systems,
with a wealth of tools and methods available for designing and evaluating
control systems. However, is it feasible to settle for a compromise in this
case? There are many scenarios in which nonlinear processes predominantly
operate around a specific point, meaning that a linear approximation of the
process model in that vicinity may provide a satisfactory level of accuracy.
These localized models can offer valuable insights into the problem at hand and
aid in devising pragmatic control strategies. In this chapter, we begin by
exploring how process models described by nonlinear differential equations can
be linearly approximated.

To assist in constructing I/O relationships from linear models, we introduce
the Laplace transform. A significant advantage of this transform is its ability
to change linear differential equations into algebraic equations, greatly
simplifying the mathematical manipulations needed to develop an I/O model. Such
an algebraic model, known as the transfer function, is used extensively in
control system design and analysis.

## Empirical models

- We can construct an empirical model using plant data

- Assume a certain idealized model structure

- First-order plus deadtime (FOPDT) model
 
  Time domain form
  $$\tau_p \frac{dy(t)}{dt} + y(t) = K_p u(t - \theta_p)$$

  Frequency domain form (transfer function)
  $$ G_p(s) = \frac{K_p e^{-\theta_p s}}{\tau_p s + 1}$$

- $K_p$: Process gain; $\tau_p$: time constant; $\theta_p$: deadtime

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}
FOPDT model is often used in controller tuning.
A transfer function is a mathematical formula that describes how a system responds to different inputs over time.

- Frequency domain

  $$ G_p(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{K_p}{\tau^2 s^2 + 2 \xi \tau s + 1}$$

- The ultimate (steady-state) value of the response, $\bar{h} (t \to \infty)$, is
  equal to k for a unit-step change.

- When the elapsed time is equal to the process time constant $t = \tau$, the
  system reaches 63.2% of its final response.

- After approximately 5τ, the transient response can be considered as having
  reached steady-state.

- For a given t / τ, the output reaches the same fraction of the ultimate
  output response value.

which in turn increases the hydrostatic pressure and subsequently the outlet
flow rate. The system eventually reaches a new steady state. This feature is

# Analysis of Process Systems
* Stability analysis and the concept of poles and zeros
* Frequency response analysis
* Bode plots and Nyquist plots

### Properties of transfer functions 

- For transfer function

  $$g(s)= \frac{y(s)}{u(s)} = 
  \frac{b_0 s^m + \ldots + b_m}{a_0 s^n + \ldots + a_n} = 
  \frac{z(s)}{p(s)}
  $$

- The roots of the polynomial z(s) are the **zeros** of the transfer function or
  the zeros of the process.

- The roots of the polynomial p(s) are the **poles** of the transfer function or
  the poles of the process.

- A physical system needs to be *proper* ($n \geq m$), and *casual* (output
  depends only on past inputs)

- Characteristic equation

  The denominator polynomial p(s) when equated to zero is called the
  characteristic equation:

  $p(s) = a_0 s^n + \ldots + a_n = 0$

### Stability of linear systems {auto-animate=true}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=60%}

:::{.fragment index=1}

- The location of the poles of a transfer function determines the bounded
  input–bounded output (BIBO) stability of a process.

:::

:::{.fragment index=2}

- If the transfer function of a dynamic process has a pole with a positive real
  part, the process is unstable. If the real part is zero, then the process is
  critically stable

:::

:::{.fragment index=4}

- We need to be cautious when we derive a transfer function model from a
  statespace model, because a zero (or zeros) may cancel a pole (or poles).
  This becomes especially important if the canceled pole is unstable, which
  means that those modes of the process would be hidden from us.

- The first step in Routh's Criterion is to set up the Routh array.

- Then, we examine the first column of the array. If there are no sign changes
  in the first column, the system is stable.

- If there are sign changes in the first column, the system is unstable. The
  number of sign changes corresponds to the number of roots with positive real
  parts.

- The method provides insights into stability and transient response.

- Root locus begins at open-loop poles and ends at open-loop zeros.

- The plot exists on parts of the complex plane where the number of open-loop
  poles and zeros to the right is odd.
