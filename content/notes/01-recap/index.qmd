## Importance of process analysis and control

Chemical processes greatly influence every aspect of our life. 
All important industrial sector such as food production, water treatment,
healthcare and pharmaceuticals, energy, automotives, and so on rely on chemical
process industry to supply ingradients, raw materials, and enabling
technologies. 
In recent years, significant attention is given to sustainability in the
chemical process industry. New processes and retrofit of existing processes are 
based on responsible resource utilization, minimization of environmental impact,
and considerations to long-term viability and competitiveness.
Chemical processes involve several unit operations, such as
mixing, heat exchange, mass transfer, and reaction.
In a chemical process, required unit operations are performed in a specific
sequence to achieve specific objectives.
In order to ensure optimal operations of the process it is important to have
efficient and effective control over process variables such as temperature,
pressure, flow rate, and composition. 
Optimal operations are crucial for maintaining safety, and achieving desired
product quality. 
Control systems and advanced algorithms are deployed to monitor, regulate, and
optimize the process variables.  

Controlling processes involves influencing their operation to achieve
desired outcomes. This is accomplished through the use of control units, which
regulate and guide processes to maintain steady operation and prevent
deviations from target conditions. It is important to recognize that all
industrial processes are dynamic, meaning their behavior changes over time.
Control engineers must have a deep understanding of process dynamics and
develop suitable mechanisms to influence and manage their behavior effectively.

Control engineering is an integral part of chemical engineering. 
Design engineers must account for dynamic operation and its consequences, while
plant operators must respond to disruptions for smooth operation. Experimental
engineers rely on process control for precise conditions. Without process
control, modern processing facilities cannot operate safely, reliably, and
profitably while meeting quality and environmental standards.

## Process control objectives

Control systems play a crucial role in ensuring safe and
profitable operation of processes involving various streams. 
These control systems continuously monitor process variables such as
temperature, pressure, level, flow, and concentration. 
They take actions, such as adjusting valves, controlling pump
speed, and regulating heaters, to maintain these variables at specified set
point values defined by operators. 
This enables processes to operate efficiently, meeting desired objectives while
prioritizing safety and profitability.

The primary objective of any control system is safety. 
Control systems are designed to ensure the safety of people, protect
the environment, and safeguard equipment. 
By continuously monitoring and
adjusting process variables, these systems can detect and respond to deviations
or disturbances that may pose risks or compromise the integrity of the system.
This proactive approach to safety helps prevent accidents, minimize
environmental impact, and preserve the longevity of equipment.

When faced with competing objectives, the specific tradeoff considerations vary
depending on the industry, scale, and potential consequences involved.
For example, 
In extreme scenarios such as a nuclear plant, the control system may shut down
the operations to prevent potential deadly radiation leaks. 
On the other hand, in power or chemical industry,
there is a tradeoff between controlling emissions and equipment safety. 
In order to keep the operations running optimally, the control system may
deviate from the emission norms occasionally. 
Stricter emission control measures, may place additional stress on equipment
and require diligent maintenance to ensure safe operation. 
Balancing emissions control with equipment safety becomes crucial to mitigate
environmental harm while ensuring the integrity and reliability of the
industrial process.

In addition to safety, automatic control also enhances efficiency and
performance. 
By maintaining process variables at optimal set points, these
systems enable processes to operate at peak efficiency, reduce energy
consumption, improve product quality, and increase overall productivity. 
This not only maximizes output and profitability but also contributes to
sustainability efforts by minimizing resource wastage and emissions.

After ensuring the people, environment, and equipment safety objectives are met, 
the control objectives can focus on the profit. 

Plant-level control objectives motivated by profit include:

- meeting final product specifications
- minimizing waste production
- minimizing environmental impact
- minimizing energy use
- maximizing overall production rate

Process control plays a vital role in reducing variability
:::

The optimization of process operating conditions aims to maximize economic
objectives, such as annual profit. Effective plant management involves
determining desirable operating targets and implementing an efficient automatic
control strategy to maintain these targets within acceptable limits. Chemical
engineers are well-suited for setting control objectives as they possess a
clear understanding of how the plant operates.

To identify the most desirable operating conditions, the feasible region of
operation is defined based on the physical limits of decision variables. Plant
economics are then evaluated by assessing increasing profit contours. While the
optimum operating point often lies at a corner of the feasible region,
practical considerations and plant disturbances necessitate operating at a
slight distance from this point to ensure feasible operation (@fig-optimal-plant-operations).

The control strategy focuses on minimizing variations around the operating
target and reducing the acceptable operating limits. Advanced control systems
offer the potential for operating even closer to the optimal target, resulting
in increased profitability. This improvement, quantified by a shift towards a
more profitable regime, demonstrates the financial benefits of the control
system.

## Overview of control system design

The major steps involved in designing and installing a control system using the
model-based approach are shown in the flow chart of @fig-major-steps. The first
step, formulation of the control objectives, is a critical decision. The
formulation is based on the operating objectives for the plants and the process
constraints. For example, in the distillation column control problem, the
objective might be to regulate a key component in the distillate stream, the
bottoms stream, or key components in both streams. An alternative would be to
minimize energy consumption (e.g., reboiler heat duty) while meeting product
quality specifications on one or both product streams. The inequality
constraints should include upper and lower limits on manipulated variables,
conditions that lead to flooding or weeping in the column, and product impurity
levels. After the control objectives have been formulated, a dynamic model of
the process is developed. The dynamic model can have a theoretical basis, for
example, physical and chemical principles such as conservation laws and rates
of reactions, or the model can be developed empirically from
experimental data. If experimental data are available, the dynamic
model should be validated, and the model accuracy is characterized. This latter
information is useful for control system design and tuning. The next step in
the control system design is to devise an appropriate control strategy that
will meet the control objectives while satisfying process constraints. As
indicated in @fig-major-steps, this design activity is both an art and a science.
Process understanding and the experience and preferences of the design team are
key factors. Computer simulation of the controlled process is used to screen
alternative control strategies and to provide preliminary estimates of
appropriate controller settings. Finally, the control system hardware and
instrumentation are selected, ordered, and installed in the plant. Then the
control system is tuned in the plant using the preliminary estimates from the
design step as a starting point. Controller tuning usually involves
trial-and-error procedures.

## Introduction to process modeling

Dynamic models play a central role in the subject of process dynamics and control.

- Dynamic models and computer simulation enhance process understanding by
  enabling the study of transient behavior without disturbing the actual
  process. Through simulation, valuable insights into dynamic and steady-state
  process behavior can be gained, providing valuable information even prior to
  plant construction.

- Process simulators are essential for training plant operators in handling
  complex units and emergency situations. By connecting simulators to process
  control equipment, a realistic training environment is created, similar to
  flight simulators in the aerospace industry. This enables operators to
  develop practical skills and effectively respond to challenging scenarios.

- A dynamic process model facilitates the evaluation of different control
  strategies by identifying the variables to be controlled and manipulated. It
  can also aid in preliminary controller tuning and the use of empirical models
  prior to plant start-up. In model-based control strategies, the process model
  plays an explicit role within the control law formulation, enabling more
  effective control implementation.

- Periodic recalculation of optimum operating conditions can be beneficial to
  maximize profit or minimize costs in a process. By utilizing a steady-state
  process model and economic information, the most profitable operating
  conditions can be determined. This approach, discussed in Chapter 19, allows
  for optimization and continual improvement of process performance. 

## Types of process models (empirical, mechanistic, etc.)

Models can be classified as:

- Theoretical models are developed using the principles of chemistry, physics,
  and biology.
- Empirical models are obtained by fitting experimental data.
- Semi-empirical models are a combination of the models in categories (a) and
  (b); the numerical values of one or more of the parameters in a theoretical
  model are calculated from experimental data.
