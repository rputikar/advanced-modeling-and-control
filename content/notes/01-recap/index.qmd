## Importance of process analysis and control

Chemical processes greatly influence every aspect of our life. 
All important industrial sector such as food production, water treatment,
healthcare and pharmaceuticals, energy, automotives, and so on rely on chemical
process industry to supply ingradients, raw materials, and enabling
technologies. 
In recent years, significant attention is given to sustainability in the
chemical process industry. New processes and retrofit of existing processes are 
based on responsible resource utilization, minimizes environmental impact,
and considerations to long-term viability and competitiveness.
Chemical processes involve several unit operations, such as
mixing, heat exchange, mass transfer, and reaction.
In a chemical process, required unit operations are performed in a specific
sequence to achieve specific objectives.
In order to ensure optimal operations of the process it is important to have
efficient and effective control over process variables such as temperature,
pressure, flow rate, and composition. 
Optimal operations are crucial for maintaining safety, and achieving desired
product quality. 
Control systems and advanced algorithms are deployed to monitor, regulate, and
optimize the process variables.  

Controlling processes involves influencing their operation to achieve
desired outcomes. This is accomplished through the use of control units, which
regulate and guide processes to maintain steady operation and prevent
deviations from target conditions. It is important to recognize that all
industrial processes are dynamic, meaning their behavior changes over time.
Control engineers must have a deep understanding of process dynamics and
develop suitable mechanisms to influence and manage their behavior effectively.

Control engineering is an integral part of chemical engineering. 
Design engineers must account for dynamic operation and its consequences, while
plant operators must respond to disruptions for smooth operation. Experimental
engineers rely on process control for precise conditions. Without process
control, modern processing facilities cannot operate safely, reliably, and
profitably while meeting quality and environmental standards.

## Process control objectives

Control systems play a crucial role in ensuring safe and
profitable operation of processes involving various streams. 
These control systems continuously monitor process variables such as
temperature, pressure, level, flow, and concentration. 
They take actions, such as adjusting valves, controlling pump
speed, and regulating heaters, to maintain these variables at specified set
point values defined by operators. 
This enables processes to operate efficiently, meeting desired objectives while
prioritizing safety and profitability.

The primary objective of any control system is safety. 
Control systems are designed to ensure the safety of people, protect
the environment, and safeguard equipment. 
By continuously monitoring and
adjusting process variables, these systems can detect and respond to deviations
or disturbances that may pose risks or compromise the integrity of the system.
This proactive approach to safety helps prevent accidents, minimize
environmental impact, and preserve the longevity of equipment.

When faced with competing objectives, the specific tradeoff considerations vary
depending on the industry, scale, and potential consequences involved.
For example, 
In extreme scenarios such as a nuclear plant, the control system may shut down
the operations to prevent potential deadly radiation leaks. 
On the other hand, in power or chemical industry,
there is a tradeoff between controlling emissions and equipment safety. 
In order to keep the operations running optimally, the control system may
deviate from the emission norms occasionally. 
Stricter emission control measures, may place additional stress on equipment
and require diligent maintenance to ensure safe operation. 
Balancing emissions control with equipment safety becomes crucial to mitigate
environmental harm while ensuring the integrity and reliability of the
industrial process.

In addition to safety, automatic control also enhances efficiency and
performance. 
By maintaining process variables at optimal set points, these
systems enable processes to operate at peak efficiency, reduce energy
consumption, improve product quality, and increase overall productivity. 
This not only maximizes output and profitability but also contributes to
sustainability efforts by minimizing resource wastage and emissions.

After ensuring the people, environment, and equipment safety objectives are met, 
the control objectives can focus on the profit.
