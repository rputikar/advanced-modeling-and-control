## Activities

1. Consider a continuous process$$

$$
G(s) = \frac{2 (1-s) }{(3s + 1)(s+1)}
$${#eq-1}

convert G(s) to discrete transfer function and plot the step response. Try different hold functions. 

2. For the transfer function

$$
G(s) = \frac{1}{s + 1}
$${#eq-3}

plot the effect of sample time on response. 

3. Design a feedback control system around the first-order plant 

$$
G(s) = \frac{1}{0.2s + 1}
$${#eq-2}

with the requirements that 
i. the steady-state error is less than 2% for a ramp input and 
ii. the phase margin is greater than 48 degrees. 

Use controller transfer function and check phase margin.
$$
G(s) = \frac{500s + 50}{100 s^2 + s}
$${#eq-1-1}

4. Convert the controller from @eq-1-1 to discrete form using different sample times. Plot the Bode plot for the continuous and discrete controller and discuss the differences. 

5.  Design and compare continous and digital controller for the following transfer function

$$
G(s) = \frac{2 exp(-s)}{4s + 1}
$${#eq-4}
