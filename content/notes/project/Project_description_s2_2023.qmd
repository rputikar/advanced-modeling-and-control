## Introduction 

Globally, the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions are sectors like transportation, electricity production, and industrial activities. Green hydrogen, generated through water electrolysis using renewable energy, is increasingly seen as a viable option to reduce carbon emissions in high-energy-demand sectors such as aviation and industrial manufacturing. While the majority of hydrogen is currently derived from natural gas reforming, a process that emits greenhouse gases, the focus is shifting towards the scalable and cost-effective production of green hydrogen. One of the critical challenges is balancing the inconsistent availability of renewable energy with the ongoing electrical needs of the grid.

## Problem description

In this project, you will develop a neural network-based model to simulate a reversible fuel cell that can function both as an electricity generator and as an electrolyzer. Such a model could be integrated into a simulated renewable energy microgrid to explore different operational profiles and configurations. 

The ultimate aims are 
a) to evaluate energy needs and sizing requirements for achieving specific hydrogen production goals. 
b) propose control strategies for effective control of the fuel cell.

The insights derived from the model will be used to make data-driven recommendations about promising configurations and supportive technologies.

## Suggested steps

1. Review existing renewable energy and fuel cell models. Prepare a brief literature review summarizing your findings. 

2. Use the simscape model available at [https://au.mathworks.com/help/simscape/ug/pem-electrolysis-system.html](https://au.mathworks.com/help/simscape/ug/pem-electrolysis-system.html) as a foundational resource to generate required data for the neural network model. 

3. Develop a neural network-based model for the reversible fuel cell. This model should be capable of simulating both electrolysis and electricity generation processes.

4. Identify control, manipulated, and disturbance variables. Propose and evaluate appropriate control strategies. 

## Report

Prepare a report consisting of the following:

1. Predictive modeling of PEM electrolyzer (20 marks): 
   Present a comprehensive note (5 â€“ 6 pages) on the state of the art of use of data driven modeling for design, control, and optimization of PEM electrolyzer for hydrogen production.
2. ANN model for a PEM electrolyzer (NF/RO) plant (40 marks): 
2. Control strategy for PEM electrolyzer (20 marks)
3. Critical review (10 marks)
   Present a critical review of your modeling and control activity.
   Some key guiding questions (not limited to) are: 
   Why should we believe your simulations?
   What worked, What did not work?
   How to improve the simulations?
