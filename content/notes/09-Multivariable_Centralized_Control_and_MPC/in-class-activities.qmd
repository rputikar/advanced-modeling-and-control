## Activities

1. Explain the advantages and limitations of Model Predictive Control compared to the conventional decentralized PID control system.

2. Consider the process given by

$$
G(s)=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{2 \exp (-7 s)}{10 s+1} & \frac{0.5 \exp (-4 s)}{19 s+1} \\
\frac{\exp (-2 s)}{20 s+1} & \frac{1.5 \exp (-3 s)}{15 s+1}
\end{array}\right]
$${#eq-1}

Design the decouplers $D_{12}$ and $D_{21}$ and comment whether the systems are physically realizable or not.

3. The discrete-time step response model of a process is given in @tbl-1.

| t | i | $\Delta u$ | y(t) | a~i~ |
| - | - | - | - | -                |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0                |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0.3 | 0.3            |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 0.6 | 0.6            |
| 3 | 3 | 0 | 0.7 | 0.7            |
| 4 | 4 | 0 | 0.8 | 0.8            |
| 5 | 5 | 0 | 0.86 | 0.86          |
| 6 | 6 | 0 | 0.88 | 0.88          |
| 7 | 7 | 0 | 0.89 | 0.89          |

:Discrete-time step response model {#tbl-1}

Suppose that the process is subjected to a consecutive step changes in the input: $\Delta u=1$ at t=0, $\Delta u=1$ at t=2 and $\Delta u=-1$ at t=4, determine the values of y~5~ and y~9~.

3. Consider the transfer function below
$$
G(s) = \frac{18}{(s + 5) (s + 3)}
$${#eq-2}

The zero hold transfer function is given by 
$$
G_{ZOH} = \frac{1 - e^{-sT_s}}{s}
$${#eq-3}

determine the discrete transfer function using `c2d` command for different T~s~. Plot the responses.
