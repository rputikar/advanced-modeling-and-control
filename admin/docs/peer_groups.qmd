For this unit, you will be working in pairs (peer pair) or in groups of four
(two companion pairs). You will work with your pair buddy/ group member for
lectures, workshops, and labs. However, you would be free to choose your
project partners (project is supposed to be done in a group of 4. 

I have tried to use the information you have provided to create pairs. You
might be paired with someone whom you already know or someone who you will work
with for the first time.  If you have any legitimate concerns/ issues with the
pair/ group please get in touch with me. 

The peer groups for semester 2, 2024 are as follows: 

| Group ID | Partner group | Members | 
|- |- |- | 
| 1 | 2 | Amanda, Sherie | 
| 2 | 1 | Ben, Ross | 
| 3 | 4 | Bryce, Jake | 
| 4 | 3 | Eric, Tara|
| 5 | 6 | Gianluca, Lin | 
| 6 | 5 | Hedy, Jye | 
| 7 | 8 | Leila, Owen | 
| 8 | 7 | Max, Zhi Qian | 
| 9 | 10 | Mitchell, Pri |
| 10 | 9 | Paul, Tom | 

Some considerations: 

1. If your pair buddy is present, join them for the lecture, workshop, lab.
2. if your pair buddy is absent, join your companion pair for lecture,
   workshop, lab.
3. If your pair/ companion pair buddies are absent, you are free to regroup
   with others. 
4. Make sure that your companion pair and you sit at adjacent computers.
