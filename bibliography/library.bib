	abstract     = {As a result of human activity, approximately 7 Gt of carbon are emitted to the earth’s atmosphere each year. A large portion of this carbon is in the form of gaseous CO2, and approximately 30\% of this CO2 comes from fossil fuel power plants. In addition to rising levels of atmospheric CO2, the earth’s temperature is increasing. Since CO2 can act as a trap for heat (similar to the glass in a greenhouse), reduction of CO2 emissions is an important area of research. Separation and sequestration of CO2 are near-term goals for emissions reduction. Better fuel efficiency (in power production, transportation, and other areas) can be considered a mid-term goal. An acceptable long-term goal for reducing emissions is using alternate power sources such as nuclear, solar, and wind power. Because separation and sequestration are short-term goals, they are critical and challenging steps for researchers. Methods that are reviewed in this paper include absorption using solvents or solid sorbents, pressure- and temperature-swing adsorption using various solid sorbents, cryogenic distillation, membranes, and several novel and emerging technologies. Upon completion of this review, it was concluded that the most promising current method for CO2 separation is liquid absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA). While this method is currently most promising, the development of ceramic and metallic membranes for membrane diffusion should produce membranes significantly more efficient at separation than liquid absorption. The other methods investigated in this report are either too new for comparison or appear unlikely to experience significant changes to make them desirable for implementation.},

	abstract     = {We have studied plane shear flow of nearly homogeneous assemblies of uniformly sized, spherical particles in periodic domains. Our focus has been on the effect of interparticle attractive forces on the flow behavior manifested by dense assemblies. As a model problem, the cohesion resulting from van der Waals force acting between particles is considered. Simulations were performed for different strengths of cohesion, shear rates, particle stiffnesses, particle volume fractions and coefficients of friction. From each simulation, the average normal and shear stresses and the average coordination number have been extracted. Not surprisingly, the regimes of flow reported by Campbell [C.S. Campbell, Granular Shear Flows at the Elastic Limit, J. Fluid Mech. 465 (2002) 261-291] for the case of cohesionless particles – namely, inertial, elastic–inertial and elastic–quasistatic regimes – persist when cohesion is included. The elastic–quasistatic regime was found to correspond with the coordination number decreasing with increasing shear rate, while in the inertial regime the coordination number increased with shear rate. A striking result observed in the simulations is that the influence of cohesion on stress becomes more pronounced with decreasing particle volume fraction. Furthermore, the window in the shear rate–particle volume fraction space over which the elastic–quasistatic regime is obtained was found to expand as the strength of cohesion was increased. When the particle volume fraction is so high that even a cohesionless system would be in the elastic–quasistatic regime, the addition of cohesion had minimal effect on the stresses. At lower particle volume fractions where a cohesionless assembly would have been in the inertial regime, we present a new scaling which permits collapse of all the data at various strengths of cohesion and shear rates into a single master curve for each particle volume fraction and coefficient of friction. The regimes of flow in this master curve are discussed and the scaling for the normal stress in elastic–quasistatic flow is identified.},

	abstract     = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a two-step combustion process that produces a pure CO2 stream, ready for compression and sequestration. A CLC system is composed by two reactors, an air and a fuel reactor, and an oxygen carrier (OC) circulating between the reactors, which transfers the oxygen necessary for the fuel combustion from the air to the fuel. This system can be designed similar to a circulating fluidised bed, but with the addition of a bubbling fluidised bed on the return side. A mapping of the range of operational conditions, design values, and OC characteristics is presented for the most usual metal oxides (CuO, Fe2O3, and NiO) and different fuel gases (CH4, H2, and CO). The pressure operation of a CLC system is also considered. Moreover, a comparison of the possible use of three high reactive OCs (Cu10Al-I, Fe45Al-FG, Ni40Al-FG) previously characterised is carried out. It was found that the circulation rates and the solids inventories are linked, and the possible operating conditions are closely dependent on the reactivity of the OCs. The operational limits of the solids circulation rates, given by the mass and heat balances in the system, were defined for the different type of OCs. Moreover, a plot to calculate the solids inventories in a CLC system, valid for any type of OC and fuel gas, is proposed. The minimum solids inventories depended on the fuel gas used, and followed the order CH4 {$>$} CO {$>$} H2. Values of minimum solids inventories in a range from 40 to 133 kg/MWf were found for the OCs used in this work, excepting for the reaction of Fe45Al-FG with CH4, which needs a higher amount of solids because of its low reactivity. From the economic analysis carried out it was found the cost of the OC particles does not represent any limitation to the development of the CLC technology.},

	abstract     = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a method for the combustion of fuel gas with inherent separation of carbon dioxide. This technique involves the use of two interconnected reactors, an air reactor and a fuel reactor. The oxygen demanded in the fuel combustion is supplied by a solid oxygen carrier, which circulates between both reactors. Fuel gas and air are never mixed and pure CO2 can be obtained from the flue gas exit. This paper presents the results from the use of an iron-based oxygen-carrier in a continuously operating laboratory CLC unit, consisting of two interconnected fluidized beds. Natural gas or syngas was used as fuel, and the thermal power was between 100 and 300 W. Tests were performed at four temperatures: 1073, 1123, 1173 and 1223 K. The prototype was successfully operated for all tests and stable conditions were maintained during the combustion. The same particles were used during 60 h of hot fluidization conditions, whereof 40 h with combustion. The combustion efficiency of syngas was high, about 99\% for all experimental conditions. However, in the combustion tests with natural gas, there was unconverted methane in the exit flue gases. Higher temperature and lower fuel flows increase the combustion efficiency, which ranged between 70\% and 94\% at 1123 K. No signs of agglomeration or mass loss were detected, and the crushing strength of the oxygen carrier particles did not change significantly. Complementary experiments in a batch fluidized bed were made to compare the reactivity of the oxygen carrier particles before and after the 40 h of operation, but the reactivity of the particles was not affected significantly.},

The fluid is described using an extension of the Navier-Stokes equations endowed with distributed capillary stresses in the context of a diffuse interface approach. The collapse of the bubble is triggered by overpressure in the liquid and leads to an intense jet that pierces the bubble, changing the bubble topology from spheroidal to toroidal, and impinges the solid wall inducing an intense and strongly localized load. Moreover, at bubble collapse, a compression wave is launched into the liquid surrounding the bubble. By propagating along the solid surface, the compression wave combined with the liquid jet excites the dynamics of the elastic solid, producing a complex system of waves, including, longitudinal, transversal, and Rayleigh waves, propagating in the solid. It is conjectured that the intense deformation of the solid induced by the strongly localized liquid jet may lead to the plastic deformation of the solid producing the surface pitting observed in many applications subject to cavitation-induced material damage.},

However, HDS is not very effective for the removal of thiophenic sulfur compounds due to sterically-hindered adsorption on the catalyst surface, unless operated under harsh conditions, such as high temperature, high pressure, and requirement of a noble catalyst and hydrogen. Extractive desulfurization (EDS) of fuel oils using ionic liquids (ILs) has been intensively studied in recent decades and has a good future as an alternative or complementary method to HDS. In this review, we reviewed the research results of EDS using ILs and provided comprehensive discussions on diverse factors, which influence desulfurization, such as the IL species, IL–oil mass ratio, initial sulfur content, temperature, time, mutual solubility, multiple extractions and regeneration. Potential problems or shortcomings were also stated. Some other desulfurization methods currently under study, such as extraction, oxidation, adsorption and biodesulfurization were also briefly outlined. It can be inferred that ILs remain a class of ideal solvents to realize clean fuel oil in the near future because of their desirable physiochemical properties, which are lacking in molecular organic solvents, while there are possible challenges, such as relatively high viscosity and low efficiency.},

The CREATE program aims to prepare HQP for a wider range of career options within the Canadian workforce by providing technical and professional training to enable HQP to develop the skills needed for the job market. This training is delivered in various formats such as workshops, courses, panel discussions, lab demonstrations, and innovation fairs which are suited to the needs of the HQP. The authors of this paper used a qualitative case study approach to explore the impact the CREATE program has on HQP’s job readiness. Thirty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from the program HQP. Three themes emerged from the analyzed data. One of the study findings indicated that the technical and professional training provided by the CREATE program helped HQP develop the basic skills required to enter the job market. However, some participants felt that the program only facilitated their skill development, not their job readiness. The participants stated that universities should facilitate job fairs to provide opportunities for them to meet with professionals from the government, academia, and industry. Additional research is required to examine the impact of the CREATE program by using a larger sample and different program components.},

The method based on the measurement of the time required for all the solids to leave the bed without feeding in any fresh solid is specially interesting because of its rapidity and simplicity. The determined transport velocities were strongly dependent on the solid particle size and density. The experimental values were fitted to an equation which fitted both the experimental results obtained in this work and other published results obtained with fine particles.},

These distributions are measured at room temperature with two solids (sand and coal) from group B of the Geldart classification, as a function of air velocity and solids flux. These profiles are S-shaped or non-S-shaped depending on the operating conditions, and are similar to those reported in the literature with other types and sizes of solids. The Kunii and Levenspiel exponential-decay model for the axial voidage profiles has been modified to consider a freeboard height lower than the transport disengaging height (TDH), developing some equations to obtain the axial voidage profiles at heights lower than the TDH. Two equations have been proposed to calculate the K constant and the decay constant a as a function of the operating conditions. The modified model gives a good fittiiag of the experimental results obtained in this work and those obtained by other authors in different conditions and experimental set-ups.},

A new algorithm called best network after multiple iterations (BNMI) is introduced to help in determining the appropriate ANN architecture. The prediction performance of the developed models using BNMI algorithm was significantly better (between 6\% and 59\% better goodness of fit for various models) when compared to a previous study carried out by the authors which used the default single iteration ANN training algorithm of MATLAB®. The ANN models were further used to design the supervisory MPC for the residential HVAC system. The MPC generated the dynamic temperature set-point profiles of the zone air and buffer tank water which resulted in the operating cost reduction of the equipment without violating the thermal comfort constraints. When compared to the fixed set-point (FSP), MPC was able to save operating cost between 6\% and 73\% depending on the season.},

However, due to their substantial benefits with respect to significantly improved heat transfer and fouling reduction, successful applications also exist in areas such as petrochemical, minerals and food processing as well as in the paper and power industries. The excellent performance of fluidized bed heat exchangers is related to the interaction between particles and heat transfer surface and to mixing effects in the viscous sublayer. In this paper, the results of experimental investigations on heat transfer for a wide range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are presented. New design equations have been developed for the prediction of bed voidage and heat transfer coefficients. The predictions of these correlations and of numerous correlations recommended by other authors are compared with a large database compiled from the literature. Ó 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract     = {Meso-scale structures that take the form of clusters and streamers are commonly  observed in dilute gas–particle flows, such as those encountered in risers. Continuum  equations for gas–particle flows, coupled with constitutive equations for particle-phase  stress deduced from kinetic theory of granular materials, can capture the formation of  such meso-scale structures. These structures arise as a result of an inertial instability  associated with the relative motion between the gas and particle phases, and an  instability due to damping of the fluctuating motion of particles by the interstitial  fluid and inelastic collisions between particles. It is demonstrated that the meso-scale  structures are too small, and hence too expensive, to be resolved completely in  simulation of gas–particle flows in large process vessels. At the same time, failure  to resolve completely the meso-scale structures in a simulation leads to grossly  inaccurate estimates of inter-phase drag, production/dissipation of pseudo-thermal  energy associated with particle fluctuations, the effective particle-phase pressure and  the effective viscosities. It is established that coarse-grid simulation of gas–particle  flows must include sub-grid models, to account for the effects of the unresolved meso-scale  structures. An approach to developing a plausible sub-grid model is proposed.},

Each procedure is performed to satisfy a constrained nonlinear optimization formulation. Input parameters include radius and coordination numbers density functions. A monodisperse and polydisperse packings were simulated by incorporating physically based properties of glass bead packings obtained from 3D computed tomography images. In each simulated system, the packing density obtained was very close to the packing density of the physical system. The packings were tested for isotropy, homogeneity and randomness and then compared to experimental microtomography images. Findings indicate that the packings generated were isotropic, homogenous, random, and in a good agreement with the experimental data.},

Surprisingly, this work shows that the global Sherwood number Sh∞ plateaus with the Péclet number Pe when it is larger than 1000, which was not previously reported. Local Sherwood numbers for transfer through the film (Shbf) and the caps (Shbs) allow to distinguish their contributions. Shbf evolves as given by the falling film theory, whereas Shbs follows the penetration theory only at moderate Péclet number. A dimensionless correlation to predict Sh∞ gathers results from contrasted configurations: Sh∞ is mainly sensitive to both Pe (before saturation) and the gas hold-up ϵG. The benefit of working with unit cells of small ϵG in milli-reactors is therefore highlighted.},

This empirical proportionality implies that the key to chemical separation is the free energy of unmixing, that is, to entropic effects. It suggests that pollution abatement involves balancing concentration and toxicity using multiobjective optimization, and hence, a strategy for optimizing pollution abatement is obtained. This knowledge provides insight for policy that incentivizes cleanup of the most important pollutants from contaminated water, whether there is one or many pollutants.},

Among the many data-driven approaches recently applied to such a discipline, ML-based reduced-order models (ROMs) have received particular attention because of their algorithmic simplicity, explainability, and computational efficiency. In this work, we have devised and implemented an ML-based ROM which combines dimensionality reduction via an Encoder-Decoder (ED) neural network with forecasting capabilities in latent space using Deep Neural Operators (DeepONets). We assessed the proposed architecture with a spatiotemporal dataset generated by the numerical solution of the Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) problem. The reconstruction error of the model over the unseen datasets was lower than \$10\textbackslash\%\$, demonstrating the ED technique's accurate spatial representation and the neural operators' robustness in estimating future system states. This work represents a solid contribution to the fluid dynamics community with an accurate and efficient ML-based model to tackle the challenging well-known RBC problem.},

The model was evaluated comprehensively by comparing its predictions with experimental results reported for a CFB riser operating at various solid mass fluxes and superficial gas velocities. The model was capable of predicting the main features of the complex gas–solids flow, including the cluster formation of the solid phase along the walls, for different operating conditions. The model also predicted the coexistence of up-flow in the lower regions and downward flow in the upper regions at the wall of the riser for high gas velocity and solid mass flux, as reported in the literature. The predicted solid volume fraction and axial particle velocity were in good agreement with the experimental data within the high density fast fluidization regime.

	abstract     = {In recent years several processes incorporating a carbonation–calcination loop in an interconnected fluidized bed reactor have been proposed as a way to capture CO2 from flue gases. This paper is a first approximation to the modelling of a fluidized bed carbonator reactor. In this reactor the flue gas comes into contact with an active bed composed of particles with very different activities, depending on their residence time in the bed and in the carbonation–calcination loop. The model combines the residence time distribution functions with existing knowledge about sorbent deactivation rates and sorbent reactivity. The fluid dynamics of the solids (CSTR) and gases (PF) in the carbonator are based on simple assumptions. The carbonation rates are modelled defining a characteristic time for the transition between a fast reaction regime to a regime with a zero reaction rate. On the basis of these assumptions the model is able to predict the CO2 capture efficiency for the flue gas depending on the operating and design conditions. Operating windows with high capture efficiencies are discussed, as well as those conditions where only modest capture efficiencies are possible.},

The FSLBM uses a volume of fluid approach to reduce the problem of a liquid–gas two-phase flow to a single-phase free surface simulation. In bubbly flows compression effects leading to an increase or decrease of pressure in the suspended bubbles cannot be neglected. Therefore, the free surface simulation is augmented by a bubble model that supplies the missing information by tracking the topological changes of the free surface in the flow. The new model presented here is capable of handling the effects of bubble breakup and coalesce without causing a significant computational overhead. Thus, the enhanced bubble model extends the applicability of the FSLBM to a new range of practically relevant problems, like bubble formation and development in chemical reactors or foaming processes.},

	abstract     = {Fluidized bed combustion can be used for energy production or incineration for almost any material containing carbon, hydrogen and sulphur in a combustible form, whether it be in the form of a solid, liquid, slurry or gas. The technology's fuel flexibility arises from the fact that the fuel is present in the combustor at a low level and is burnt in the mass of a thermally inert bed material (typically this is limestone if sulphur capture is required, otherwise sand). However, fuel flexibility must either be built into the design of the combustor or alternatively the FBC system must be tailored for a specific fuel or combination of fuels. In addition, the designer must consider issues like heat release patterns, ash characteristics (particularly if the ash has any potential for agglomeration or fouling of heat transfer surfaces or blockage of the return valve in the case of a circulating FBC) and any special requirements of the fuel such as the need for sulphur or HCl capture. This paper surveys the literature on some of the more important alternative fuels and also makes specific recommendations about problems or major issues with those fuels. Particular attention is given to the use of FBC for petroleum coke, coal wastes, wood pulp sludges, and biomass residues. These fuels are emphasized because of their current economic importance, particularly in North America.},

	abstract     = {Fluidized bed combustors (FBCs) are noted for their ability to capture SO2 in situ via direct reaction with Ca-based sorbents. However, despite more than 30 years of intensive study of sulfation processes in atmospheric FBC boilers and numerous laboratory studies, there are still many uncertainties and disagreements on the subject. In particular, the mechanisms of the sulfation reaction are still not properly understood, and there is dispute over the explanation of the well-known temperature maximum for optimum sulfur capture found in FBC boilers. This paper discusses these points of contention and suggests the most probable mechanisms and explanations for the various phenomena seen with sulfur capture, based on current literature and personal experimentation. ᭧ 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract     = {A numerical formulation for Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations of particle-laden flows in complex geometries is developed. The formulation accounts for the finite-size of the dispersed phase. Similar to the commonly used point-particle formulation, the dispersed particles are treated as point-sources, and the forces acting on the particles are modeled through drag and lift correlations. In addition to the inter-phase momentum exchange, the presence of particles affects the fluid phase continuity and momentum equations through the displaced fluid volume. Three flow configurations are considered in order to study the effect of finite particle size on the overall flowfield: (a) gravitational settling, (b) fluidization by a gaseous jet, and (c) fluidization by lift in a channel. The finite-size formulation is compared to point-particle representations, which do not account for the effect of finite-size. It is shown that the fluid displaced by the particles plays an important role in predicting the correct behavior of particle motion. The results suggest that the standard point-particle approach should be modified to account for finite particle size, in simulations of particle-laden flows.},

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations governing the carrier flow were solved by using a direct numerical simulation approach and coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking. Calculations were performed at Reynolds number based on the wall-shear velocity and channel half-width, Res \% 184, and for three different sets of solid particles. For each particle set, two cases were examined, in the first one the particle motion was governed by both drag and lift wall-corrected forces, whereas in the other one, the standard drag force (not corrected) was solely acting. The lift force model used represents the most accurate available expression since it accounts for weak and strong shear as well as for wall effects. For this study, we considered elastic collisions for particles contacting the walls and that no external forces were acting. Present results indicate that the use of the lift force and of the drag corrections does not lead to significant changes in the statistical properties of the solid phase, at the exception of some statistics for the high inertia particles.},

Despite claims that new teaching approaches increase students’ motivation and achievement, empirical research concerning these positive effects is scarce, specifically regarding effects on achievement. In the present investigation, we conducted a series of quasi-experimental studies to compare new with classic teaching approaches. In four studies, we investigated the impact of flipped courses - an innovating teaching method (vs. classic teaching) - and of three innovative test formats - journal format report (vs. classic report), research article analysis and exam with all documents authorised (vs. classic exam) - on the motivation and achievement of students taking applied chemistry courses at the Higher Institute of Applied Biology of Medenine, Tunisia. Students’ motivation was increased by all new teaching approaches. Achievement scores were also significantly improved by these new methods, except for the exam with all documents authorized. Effect size calculations showed that all four new approaches had larger effects on motivation than on achievement, and that motivational vs. achievement benefits were unequally balanced across active learning tools.},

Small-scale 3D simulations were firstly conducted to elucidate the characteristics and resolution requirements of the numerical framework. Using a four-fold anisotropy model to simulate the growth of lithium deposition, the dependency of dendrite morphology on charging conditions (ϕb=−0.7V and ϕb=−1.4V) on a (larger) experimental-scale metal anode was demonstrated. The dendrite shape was found to shift from a smoother, tree-like formation at the lower applied voltage, to a more spike-like, highly branched structure at the higher voltage. The resulting morphological parameters, such as dendrite propagation rates, volume-specific area, and side branching rates, were compared against published experimental data and found to be comparable to the reported ranges for the electrodeposition of spike- or tree-like metal dendrites. This finding supports our previous observation that dendrite formation is connected to the competition between the lithium cation diffusion and electric migration, generating an uneven distribution of Li+ on the electrode surface. This observation also gives insight into dendrite inhibition strategies focusing on enhancing the diffusion of lithium ions to achieve a more uniform concentration field on the anode surface.},

Ultrasound and microwave-assisted extraction have been mostly used, but there are relevant studies using enzymes, supercritical fluids, ultrafiltration, or pressurized liquids that report a great extraction effectiveness and efficiency. However, predictive models must be developed to optimize the extraction procedures. Extracted biocompounds can be used, free or encapsulated, to develop, reformulate, and/or fortify new foods as a good tool to enhance healthiness while preserving their quality (nutritional, functional, and sensory) and safety. In the age of recycling and energy saving, more studies must evaluate the efficiency of the processes, the cost, and the environmental impact leading to the production of new foods and the sustainable extraction of phytochemicals.},

The HEAM demonstrated that lowering the electrode compression and enhancing the channel area lowers the pump power loss independent of the flow fields and electrodes. Additionally, the HEAM helped elucidate the deficiencies of flow distribution in interdigitated flow fields (IFFs) and suggested designing wider manifolds and/or shorter channels improve the flow distribution. Moreover, the HEAM suggested shallower and/or wider channels, and more permeable electrodes enhance the flow penetration rate above the channels. Finally, the HEAM showed that the average penetration depth in the electrode above the ribs (hpen) was the critical parameter in the fluid-flow modeling of IFFs and was inversely proportional to the permeability. Hence, there is a trade-off between the pump power loss and hpen when configuring electrode permeability.},

	abstract     = {Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) is a process in which high energy is released in a flowing liquid upon bubble implosion due to decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. While cavitation has been a serious problem in a hydraulic system, its energy can be harnessed for various physical and chemical processes. Food and beverage industries have been utilizing the principle of HC as a tool to homogenize, pasteurize, break, or mix food macromolecules. In this review article, the principle, design aspects, and different application of hydrodynamic cavitators in food and beverage processing are described in details. Advantages over acoustic cavitation, comparative studies, and future prospects of HC in food and beverage industries are also discussed. Practical Applications In this fast-developing world, food industries are thriving to adopt energy efficient advanced technologies. Hydrodynamic cavitators are popular in dairy research facilities and industries. Hydrodynamic cavitation has the advantages in lowering the capital cost, reducing production time, enhancing production efficiency, and food safety while preserving the quality of the food product. Hydrodynamic cavitators can be utilized for the purpose of extraction, emulsification, sterilization, and homogenization. Large-scale application of hydrodynamic cavitators is still not common and there is scope for its applications in different food and beverage industries.},

	abstract     = {The discrete element model DMX was used to simulate the settling behavior of a unique particle in an assembly of other particles in a hopper lling process. No uid effects or cohesive forces were modeled so the results are applicable for non-cohesive particles with diameters greater than about 1 mm where air effects can be neglected. No vibration or other such external load was included. The settling behavior of the unique particle was investigated in terms of the density ratio and the diameter ratio, and of varying conditions of chronological entry position, initial assembly velocity and system friction. The model showed satisfactory agreement with several observations reported regarding this behavior. The model demonstrated that at a high density ratio ‘sinking’ is dominant irrespective of the size of the particle, initial position or initial velocity, whereas a balance between particle size and density determine whether a particle sinks or rises at other densities. Based on this, a preliminary phase diagram was derived showing when a particle will sink or rise or do neither (termed ‘neutral’) as a function of particle size and diameter ratios. The model also showed that the initial position has only a qualifying effect on the behavior of the unique particle and the initial velocity is only signi cant at low-density ratios where with higher velocities the lighter particle will rise more. At lower friction these effects are enhanced. Repeating some simulation runs on larger binary systems showed that these effects could cause some segregation during settling.},

This makes it relevant to search for modern, more effective technologies and equipment, the use of which will significantly increase overall production productivity, reduce overall specific energy consumption, improve the quality of the finished products and safety of processes for the environment. The paper analyzes and generalizes methods for intensifying extraction processes from plant materials. The most effective ways to intensify hydrodynamic processes include methods based on cavitation phenomena. ~Transformation and redistribution of energy, which occur during the formation and collapse of vapor bubbles due to the creation of a high difference in pressure, temperature, and potential, contribute to a significant increase in the efficiency of dynamic effects on complex heterogeneous systems during extraction. Cavitation technologies ensure ecological purity and safety of the process, make it possible to accelerate mass transfer processes, activate the extractant, obtain a high yield of biologically active substances (BAS) and maintain their properties. Acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation are most commonly used. Modern research is conducted in search of new solutions to optimize technologies, as well as improvement of cavitation equipment. Examples of hydrodynamic cavitation devices of static and dynamic types are cylindrical and disk rotor-pulsation devices, valve-type high-pressure homogenizers, pulsating dispersers, centrifugal pumps and Venturi tubes. They are used to intensify the processes at the stages of preparation of plant raw materials, activation of the extractant, as well as the extraction itself. Static-type cavitation devices based on the Venturi tube have a number of advantages in terms of design, technological and economic solution.},

Changes in slope of the expansion curve were associated with regime changes, and can prove useful for the analysis of large diameter fluid beds.

The ECT output indicated that there were two types of systematic fluctuations in the time series of mass flow rate and concentration. The frequencies of these have been obtained from power spectral density analyses. For the higher frequency fluctuations, the Strouhal number (fDt /ugs ) was found to depend on the square root of the solids/gas momentum flux ratio.

The aggregates are assumed to be small with respect to the Kolmogorov length scale and the flow is assumed to be homogeneous. Further, it is assumed that breakup is caused by hydrodynamic stresses acting on the aggregates, and breakup is therefore assumed to follow a first-order kinetic where               K                                B                              (               x               ) is the breakup rate function and               x               is the aggregate mass. To model               K                                B                              (               x               ), it is assumed that an aggregate breaks instantaneously when the surrounding flow is violent enough to create a hydrodynamic stress that exceeds a critical value required to break the aggregate. For aggregates smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale the hydrodynamic stress is determined by the viscosity and local energy dissipation rate whose fluctuations are highly intermittent. Hence, the first-order breakup kinetics are governed by the frequency with which the local energy dissipation rate exceeds a critical value (that corresponds to the critical stress). A multifractal model is adopted to describe the statistical properties of the local energy dissipation rate, and a power-law relation is used to relate the critical energy dissipation rate above which breakup occurs to the aggregate mass. The model leads to an expression for               K                                B                              (               x               ) that is zero below a limiting aggregate mass, and diverges for               x               → ∞. When simulating the breakup process, the former leads to an asymptotic mean aggregate size whose scaling with the mean energy dissipation rate differs by one third from the scaling expected in a non-fluctuating flow.},

From a comparative analysis of the different computational approaches available for turbulent multiphase flows it is argued that the point–particle approach is uniquely suited to address turbulent multiphase flows where the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of particle time scale to Kolmogorov time scale ðsp=skÞ, is greater than 1. The Stokes number estimate has been used to establish parameter range where point–particle approach is ideally suited. The point–particle approach can be extended to handle ‘‘finite-sized” particles whose diameter approach that of the smallest resolved eddies. However, new challenges arise in the implementation of Lagrangian–Eulerian coupling between the particles and the carrier phase. An approach where the inter-phase momentum and energy coupling can be separated into a deterministic and a stochastic contribution has been suggested.},

Improvement of our understanding of the complex hydrodynamic behaviours involved in these processes requires refined and local physical models. The approach retained at the Laboratoire National d’Hydraulique of EDF for the prediction of the two-phase flows in complex geometries is based on the two-fluid model formalism, where both phases are characterised by their first velocity moments Žvolumetric concentration, mean velocity and second order fluctuating velocity correlation tensors.. Separate transport equations are written for each moment with appropriate closure assumptions for unknown terms such as the momentum exchange between the two phases and the effective stress tensors of both phases.},

This information combined with the density of the material fluidized allows direct determination of void fraction a t any location in the bed.

The CT technique has shown the presence of bypass regions which are generally undesirable since they decrease gas-solid contact. CT scanning of model reactors could be a very useful technique to obtain experimental verification of the flow patterns in reactors of different design as well as determining the effectiveness of baffles in eliminating bypassing. A second benefit of the CT technique is the ability to take vertical cross sections a t different locations, i.e., at a diameter and then along several cords parallel to the diameter.

Accurate predictions of bubble size and velocity are, therefore, essential for the reliable design and successful operation of fluidized bed reactors. Direct measurement of bubble properties with X-rays cannot be used with large units. Although probes could be used, they interfere with the bubbles and cannot provide accruate results. A technique was, therefore, developed to measure the average rise velocity of the gas bubbles through a fluidized bed. A gas tracer such as helium is injected in the gas distributor holes, at the bottom of the bed. A small flowrate of gas-solid mixture was sampled from just above the bed surface at a velocity high enough to ensure turbulent flow in the sampling tube. Calibration runs showed that signal degradation was minimal. The average bubble velocity was determined from the speed at which a helium concentration step traveled from the bottom to the top of the bed. These results were confirmed with bed expansion and TDH measurements. The best predictions were obtained with Darton's correlation for bubble size and the correlation from Hilligardt and Werther for bubble velocity.},

	abstract     = {Radial solids velocity profiles were computed on seven axial levels in the riser of a high-flux circulating fluidized bed (HFCFB) using a twophase 3-D computational fluid dynamics model. The computed solids velocities were compared with experimental data on a riser with an internal diameter of 76 mm and a height of 10 m, at a high solids flux of 300 kg mÀ2 sÀ1 and a superficial velocity of 8 m sÀ1. Several hundreds of experimental and numerical studies on CFBs have been carried out at low fluxes of less than 200 kg mÀ2 sÀ1, whereas only a few limited useful studies have dealt with high solids flux. The k–e two-phase turbulence model was used to describe the gas–solids flow in an HFCFB. The model predicts a core–annulus flow in the dilute and developed flow regions similar to that found experimentally, but in the region of highest solids concentration it is somewhat overpredicted at the level close to the inlet.},

The study aims at determining the effects of changing the riser diameter of a generic combustor on the local concentration. Mean cross-sectional solid volume fractions and radial profiles of solid-up are measured in the Cornell facility for two kinds of suspension, thus simulating a combustor of two different sizes. Local solid fraction turn out to be independent of the riser size, as long as its diameter remains moderate. A self-similar radial profile exists in the dilute section of the bed and, at least, for the present operating conditions. (authors). 18 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.},

	abstract     = {In the past most poly-disperse spray models have been based on either discretising the liquid flow field into groups of equally sized droplets, as in the discrete droplet model (DDM) in which parcels of drops are tracked in space in a Lagrangian framework, or by solving separate Eulerian conservation equations for a number of size ranges. Both of these approaches can result in very long computing times, although the DDM is generally regarded as being superior in this respect under most conditions of interest. Recently an alternative approach to the modelling of sprays has been developed by Beck [Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 2000] and Beck and Watkins [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 2003]. In this approach the size information concerning the spray is obtained by solving conservation and transport equations for two moments of the drop number distribution, and their respective mean velocities, and obtaining two other moments from an assumed size distribution function. The sub-models required in this approach, for hydrodynamic phenomena in sprays, such as drop drag, break-up and collisions, have been presented elsewhere [Beck, Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 2000; Beck and Watkins, J. Comp. Phys., 2002]. The purpose of this paper is to present those sub-models relating to the mass and heat transfer processes in sprays. As part of this, an equation for the energy of the liquid phase is required. Standard gas phase equations, including a k–e turbulence model, are also solved. All the equations are solved in a Eulerian framework using the finite-volume approach. The inter-phase heat and mass transfers are captured through the use of source terms, and all the source terms for these aspects of the spray model are derived in this paper in terms of the four moments of the droplet number distribution in order to find the net effect on the whole spray flow field. The model has been applied to a wide variety of different sprays, including high-pressure diesel sprays, wide-angle solid cone water sprays, hollow cone sprays and evaporating sprays [Beck, Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 2000]. The comparisons of the results with experimental data show that the model generally performs well. In this paper the evaporation effects are examined and compared with experimental data wherever possible. Again this aspect of the spray model is shown to be generally successful.},

This paper describes the design and implementation of a spray model able to capture the full polydisperse nature of the spray flow without using droplet size classes. Instead, the moments of the droplet size distribution function are used to describe the distribution of droplet sizes. Transport equations are written for the two moments which represent the liquid mass and surface area, and two more moments representing total radius and droplet number are approximated via use of a presumed distribution function allowed to vary in space and time. The velocities to be used in the two transport equations are obtained by defining moment-average quantities and constructing further transport equations for the relevant moment-average velocities. An equation for the energy of the liquid phase and standard gas phase equations, including a k-ε turbulence model, are also solved. All the equations are solved in an Eulerian framework using the finite-volume approach, and the phases are coupled through source terms. Effects such as droplet break-up and droplet-droplet collisions are also captured through the use of source terms, and all the source terms are derived in terms of the four moments of the droplet size distribution in order to find the net effect on the whole spray flow field.},

The main objective of this study is to understand the effect of gas phase turbulence on nitric oxide formation in single droplet flames. Since the interaction of gas phase velocity fluctuations with droplet burning is of sequential character, a separate investigation of droplet momentum coupling and droplet burning is performed. Momentum coupling controls droplet relaxation against changes of the gas phase velocity along the droplet trajectory and, thereby, determines to what extend gas phase velocity fluctuations translate into droplet slip velocity fluctuations. This coupling effect acts as a high pass filter with a cutoff frequency determined by the droplet Reynolds number and diameter. In the simulation of single droplet burning detailed models for chemical reaction, diffusive species transport and evaporation are used. A significant effect of slip velocity fluctuations on the mean values of NO formation rate is observed. The effect of slip velocity fluctuations on the mean NO formation rate is frequency dependent. The frequency response of the droplet flame is similar to that of a low pass filter. The droplet flame time scale characterizing the response to slip velocity fluctuations is found to correlate with chemical time scales. This time scale is not affected by droplet diameter.},

It is generally understood that efficiency improvement that is consistent with high plant reliability and low cost of electricity is economically beneficial, but its effect upon reduction of all plant emissions without installation of additional environmental equipment, is less well appreciated. As CO2 emission control is gaining increasing acceptance, efficiency improvement, as the only practical tool capable of reducing CO2 emission from fossil fuel plant in the short term, has become a key concept for the choice of technology for new plant and upgrades of existing plant. Efficiency is also important for longer-term solutions of reducing CO2 emission by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS); it is essential for the underlying plants to be highly efficient so as to mitigate the energy penalty of CCS technology application. Power generating options, including coal-fired Rankine cycle steam plants with advanced steam parameters, natural gas-fired gas turbine-steam, and coal gasification combined cycle plants are discussed and compared for their efficiency, cost and operational availability.

In addition, it was revealed that bed expansion was larger when a bimodal particle mixture was applied compared with the case of mono-dispersed particles. Gas and solid phase temperature distributions in the reactor were also computed, considering the hydrodynamic of the fluidized bed and the heat generated by the solid particles. The results showed that gas temperature increases as it moves upward in the reactor due to the heat of polymerization reaction leading to the higher temperatures at the top of the bed.},

These differences were inevitably unfavorable. Particulate process plants take longer to start up and are less likely to achieve desired production rates. Facility operators often underestimate the challenges involved. These problems generally relate to an inadequate understanding of the behavior of particle systems. Many of these behaviors are sensitive to process scale or process history in ways that would not be expected by engineers familiar only with liquid or gas systems. Empiricism must often substitute for first principles. Modeling provides some answers, but often not enough to eliminate the need to operate pilot plants. This paper reviews some of the unit operations involved in particle processing and highlights scale-up issues involved. The use of information from suppliers and other third parties is discussed, as well as scale-up strategies in competitive or regulated industries.},

By using transient, 1D, grid-independent numerical solutions, we avoid the use of speculative closure terms and show that the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) is sufficient to model core-annulus regime. That regime arises in the time-average solution as a consequence of the fluctuating motion of regions with high solids concentration. These fluctuations are most sensitive to the gravitational acceleration (g) and granular energy dissipation terms. The fluctuation frequency is α \$ \textbackslash sqrt g \$. The effect of fluctuations is so dominant that decreasing the restitution coefficient (KTGF parameter) actually increases the average granular temperature. The wall boundary conditions for solids momentum and granular energy equations dictate the core-annulus flow regime. They must cause a net dissipation of granular energy at the wall for predicting that regime. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007},

	abstract     = {In this study, we are interested in deriving time-smoothed governing and constitutive equations for gas–solids flow in moderately dense systems where particle–particle collision is the main energy dissipation mechanism. Results obtained from dynamic simulations of a gas–solids flow in a 1D channel are used to show that it is possible to obtain expressions for the time-averaged constitutive relations based on Taylor series expansion. We demonstrate, by comparing with time-averaged transient results, that the 1st term (or laminar) in the series expressions of most non-linear constitutive relations can yield inaccurate quantitative and qualitative results. This means that steady-state models derived by simply removing the partial time derivative from the governing equations are not suitable for gas–solids flows. This study shows that it was necessary to include many terms of the Taylor series expression of non-linear constitutive relations (such as the granular energy dissipation term) due to large-scale oscillations that were computed for all flow variables at all locations in the 1D domain. In some cases, the Taylor series expansion diverged and the Euler transformation was used to improve the convergence of these series. In this moderately dense flow system, turbulence in the gas-phase was found to be just a reaction to turbulence in the solids phase that resulted from the large-scale motion of solids clusters. This resulted in a negative turbulent gas viscosity computed due to the fact that gas (in the horizontal direction) flows only to occupy regions vacated by clusters of solids. The steady-state results obtained using the time-smoothed gas–solids flow model compared well with the time-averaged results obtained using the transient model for all flow variables.},

In such a flow, Doppler signals may be noisy and split, since particles have long residence times in the measurement volume. A novel time average based on the measured burst lengths is proposed to estimate the cross-sectional area of the measurement volume. This time average accounts for the possible split of a noisy Doppler burst, and it provides a more general description of the measurement volume than the conventional ensemble average. The extended post-processing algorithm was tested on experimental time series obtained in a circulating fluidized bed and the algorithm was compared to conventional treatment of the particle data by a commercial PDA processor. The conventional processing strongly overestimates the vertical mass flux integrated over the cross-section. In contrast, time-mean and fluctuations of mass flux, particle volume concentration, and particle velocity are reliably estimated employing the proposed algorithm, with continuity check parameters in succeeding particle data, as well as with a particle velocity filter to estimate the size of the probe volume, applying a two-component PDA in a three-dimensional flow.},

	abstract     = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and process simulation are widely used in the process industry. The two technologies are largely complementary, each being able to capture and analyse some of the important process characteristics. Their combined application can, therefore, lead to significant industrial benefits. This is especially true for systems, such as chemical reactors, in which steady-state performance, dynamics and control strategy depend on mixing and fluid flow behaviour. This paper presents a new approach for the integration of the capabilities of CFD technology and process simulation via a general interface that allows the automatic exchange of critical variables between the two packages, leading to a simultaneous solution of the overall problem. The approach applies to both steady-state and dynamic problems. The feasibility of the approach and its first practical implementation are demonstrated by integrating a widely used CFD package (Fluent 4.5, by Fluent Inc.) within a general-purpose advanced process simulator (gPROMS 1.7, by Process Systems Enterprise Ltd. (1999)). One case study involving a batch reactor is used to illustrate the ability of the combined tool to provide information on the detailed interactions between fluid mechanics, heat transfer, reaction and control strategy, and to provide insights on important design and operational decisions. 0 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Gamma ray Computed Tomography (CT) has been used to measure the time-averaged cross-sectional solids holdup distribution. The time-averaged mean and fluctuating solids velocity fields have been quantified using the Computer Automated Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) technique. Details of the experimental techniques, protocol of implementation and data analysis are discussed. The experimental studies examine operating conditions in fast fluidization and dilute phase transport regimes. Comparative and symbiotic analyses of the results obtained from CARPT and CT have been used to develop a coherent picture of the solids flow field. In addition, this work also demonstrates the power of CARPT and CT as flow mapping techniques in studying highly turbulent and opaque multiphase systems.},

The amplitude appeared to be less dependent on the measurement location in the dense bed. Predictions based on bubble passage, bubble eruption at the upper bed surface and bed oscillation all failed to explain all observed trends and underestimated the amplitude of pressure fluctuations, suggesting that the global pressure fluctuations in gas-solids bubbling fluidized beds are the superposition of local pressure variations, bed oscillations and pressure waves generated from the bubble formation in the distributor region, bubble coalescence during their rise and bubble eruption at the upper bed surface.},

	abstract     = {Both gas and solids mixing and dispersion in circulating fluidized beds have been studied using steady and unsteady state tracer techniques. Most studies, however, have been conducted in CFB risers with relatively low solids circulation rates. In recent years, the high density and high solids flux CFB riser has received increasing attention due to its applications in catalytic cracking of crude oil and potential applications in catalytic reactions requiring high catalyst-toreactant loading ratios. In view of the significantly different flow structure in high-density and high solid flux risers where annulus solids downward flow is no longer present as revealed in some recent studies, this paper analyzed the similarity and differences of gas and solids mixing behaviour between low density and high density CFB risers based on the data recently collected in our lab and data reported in the literature. It is shown that there exists a clear transition of both gas and solids axial mixing behaviour when the flow structure changes from low density to high density operating conditions, in correspondence to the disappearance of solids downward flow near the wall region. In the low density CFB risers with solids flux lower than ∼250 kg/m2s, both gas and solids axial dispersion and backmixing increased with increasing solids flux and solids concentration. Beyond the transition to the dense suspension upflow regime, however, both gas and solids axial dispersions tend to decrease with increasing solids flux, indicating the development of gas and solids flow toward the plug flow resulting from the disappearance of solids downflow in the near wall region. Radial dispersion of gas and solids, on the other hand, showed a continuous decrease over a wide range of solids fluxes within both the low density and high density flow regions, indicating a reduced lateral exchange of gas and particles with increasing solids fluxes.},

The local pressure fluctuations are composed of multiple sources, including local bubble induced fluctuations, global bed oscillations and propagating pressure waves originating in other locations (e.g. bed surface, distributor and windbox). The interaction and coupling among bubble motion, under-damped oscillations of fluidized particles and bed surface, propagating compressible pressure waves and flow pulsation in gas–solid fluidized beds creates the complexity of local pressure fluctuations, and is likely responsible for the formation of complex but unique flow patterns. A few attempts have been reported in the literature on examining the interaction between bed oscillations, plenum chamber air pulsation and propagating pressure waves in fluidized beds, showing some promises on predicting the local pressure fluctuations. Future work should be focused on predicting local and global pressure fluctuations and the formation of unique surface flow patterns by coupling different contributing mechanisms.},

We report here in detail our use of diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) to measure the mean square particle velocity fluctuations for a 2D non-circulating gas fluidized bed of hollow glass particles whose mean diameter and effective density are 60 µm and 200 kg/m3, respectively. Mean square particle velocity fluctuations were observed to increase with superficial velocity, Us, beyond the minimum fluidization velocity. Following the uniform fluidization theory of Batchelor (1988), the function f (φ) in the expression δv2 = f (φ)Us2 was also determined and shown to increase from zero at a solids loading of φ ≈ 0.33 to a maximum at φ ≈ 0.4 before decreasing again to zero at φ ≈ 0.53. The spatial variation of the mean square particle velocity fluctuations was also determined and shown to be approximately symmetrical about the centreline where it is also maximal, and to increase with height above the distributor.},

The transport equations for the spatially filtered gas phase variables, in which source terms accounting for the droplet effects are added, are solved together with a probabilistic description of the liquid phase. The probabilistic approach for the liquid phase is based on the transport equation for the spatially filtered joint probability density function of the variables required in order to describe the state of the liquid phase. In this equation, unclosed terms representing the filtered Lagrangian rates of change of the variables describing the spray are present. General modelling ideas for subgrid-scale (SGS) effects are proposed. The capabilities of the approach and the validity of the closure models, with particular with respect to the SGS dispersion, are investigated through application to a dilute particle-laden turbulent mixing layer. It is demonstrated that the formulation is able to reproduce very closely the measured properties of both the continuous and dispersed phases. The large-eddy simulation (LES) results are also found to be entirely consistent with the experimentally observed characteristics of droplet–gas turbulence interactions. Consistent with direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies of isotropic turbulence laden with particles where the entire turbulence spectrum is found to be modulated by the presence of particles, the present investigation, which comprises the effects of particle transport upon the large-scale vortical structures of a turbulent shear flow, highlights what appears to be a selective behaviour; few large-scale frequencies gain energy whereas the remaining modes are damped.},

Technical challenges confronting process systems engineers in developing enabling tools and techniques are discussed regarding flexibility and uncertainty, responsiveness and agility, robustness and security, the prediction of mixture properties and function, and new modeling and mathematics paradigms. Exploiting intelligence from big data to drive agility will require tackling new challenges, such as how to ensure the consistency and confidentiality of data through long and complex supply chains. Modeling challenges also exist, and involve ensuring that all key aspects are properly modeled, particularly where health, safety, and environmental concerns require accurate predictions of small but critical amounts at specific locations. Environmental concerns will require us to keep a closer track on all molecular species so that they are optimally used to create sustainable solutions. Disruptive business models may result, particularly from new personalized products, but that is difficult to predict.},

	abstract     = {In order to model the complex hydrodynamic phenomena prevailing in industrial scale gas–solid bubbling fluidised bed reactors and especially the macro-scale emulsion phase circulation patterns induced by bubble–bubble interactions and bubble coalescence, a discrete bubble model (DBM) has been developed. In the DBM, the (larger) bubbles are modelled as discrete elements and are tracked individually during their rise through the emulsion phase, which is considered as a continuum. The DBM, originally developed for the description of gas–liquid flows, has been adapted to cope with bubbles with a diameter larger than the size of an Eulerian cell, which is required in view of the large bubble size distribution at higher gas flow rates. Moreover, a new drag model for a single bubble rising in a fluidised bed derived from empirical correlations has been implemented, as well as a simple model to account for bubble coalescence and break-up. The strong advantage of the DBM compared to other models previously reported in the literature for the description of large-scale fluidised beds is that it fully accounts for the two-way coupling between the bubbles and the emulsion phase, which enables direct computation of the emulsion phase velocity profiles. Comparison of the results of simulations ignoring bubble coalescence and simulations taking bubble coalescence properly into account demonstrated the significant effect of bubble coalescence on the large-scale circulation patterns prevailing in bubbling fluidised beds. The simulation results for the lateral profiles of the visible bubble flow rate have been compared qualitatively with experimental results reported by Werther [1974. Influence of the bed diameter on the hydrodynamics of gas fluidized beds. A.I.Ch.E. Symposium Series 70(141), 53–62]. The effect of the superficial gas velocity on the velocity and porosity profiles has been studied. In general, it can be concluded that the DBM is able to capture the salient features of the hydrodynamics of bubbling fluidised beds. However, further research is required to improve the closure equations for the bubble behaviour, bubble–bubble interactions and bubble coalescence and break-up to enable a complete quantitative description.},

	abstract     = {In this paper a dynamic simulator of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant, operating in the Chemical Process Engineering Research Institute (CPERI, Thessaloniki, Greece), is presented. The operation of the pilot plant permits the execution of case studies for monitoring of the dynamic responses of the unit, by imposing substantial step changes in a number of the manipulated variables. The comparison between the dynamic behavior of the unit and that predicted by the simulator arise useful conclusions on both the similarities of the pilot plant to commercial units, along with the ability of the simulator to depict the main dynamic characteristics of the integrated system. The simulator predicts the feed conversion, coke yield and heat of catalytic reactions in the FCC riser on the basis of semi-empirical models developed in CPERI and simulates the regenerator according to the two-phase theory of fluidization, with a dilute phase model taking account of postcombustion reactions. The riser and regenerator temperature, the stripper and regenerator pressure drop and the composition of the regenerator flue gas are measured on line and are used for verification of the ability of the simulator to predict the dynamic transients between steady states in both open- and closedloop unit operation. All the available process variables such as the reaction conversion, the coke yield, the carbon on regenerated catalyst and the catalyst circulation rate are used for the validation of the steady-state performance of the simulator. The comparison between the dynamic responses of the model and those of the pilot plant to step changes in the feed rate and preheat temperature reveals the ability of the simulator to accurately depict the complex pilot process dynamics in both open- and closed-loop operation. The dynamic simulator can serve as the basis for the development of a model-based control structure for the pilot plant, alongside its use as a tool for off-line process optimization studies. ᭧ 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This is due to the fact that the void propagation velocity increases with the square of the porosity for Type B particles and decreases with porosity for Type D particles.

	abstract     = {It is increasingly more important to be able to predict the conversion and yield of reactant species given the ever rising cost of the reactants and the ever decreasing acceptable level of effluent contaminants. As such, the development and use of predictive models for the reactors is necessary for most processes today. These models all take into account in some manner the relative movement of the gas and of the solid species as well as the interphase mass transfer. The model developer, unless equipped with specific experimentally based empirical correlations for the reactor system under consideration, is required to go to the open literature to obtain correlations for the axial and radial gas dispersion coefficients, the solids axial and radial dispersion coefficients and the interphase mass transfer coefficient between the solid phase and the gas phase. This is a difficult task at present since these values differ by up to 7 orders of magnitude for the mass transfer coefficient and up to 5 orders of magnitude for dispersion coefficients. This paper presents a summary of the work in these areas as found in the literature dating back to 1949 and provides a critical review to guide the selection of the best correlation (s) in circulating fluidized bed reactors.

	abstract     = {In this investigation a fiber-optic probe and an extraction solids probe are used to measure particle velocities and solids flux values. These are subsequently used to determine the local solids fractions as a function of radial position in a cold flow circulating fluidized bed (CFCFB) in operation at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Measurements were taken under several separate operating conditions ranging from dilute up-flow to core-annular flow to fast fluidization using nominal 800 micron cork particles. The solids properties and test operating conditions were chosen particularly to provide dynamic similitude between the test data and the operation of a high temperature, high pressure gasifier. The data from these conditions is different in many ways from the data developed using more conventional solids (glass, FCC, and sand) at atmospheric conditions. In this paper, the data from the middle of the riser corresponding to a height of nominally 8 m is presented. Average solids fractions are compared to the apparent values based upon the pressure drop and the near wall measurements are compared to LDV generated solids fraction values, showing good agreement with both. Also, the radial profiles tended to be relatively flat with a sharp rise at the wall.},

Particle velocity measurements were obtained with an LDV system under various operating conditions at locations near the wall to provide data in terms of a time series of particle velocity values. Time scale criteria were developed to characterize the variance of the velocity fluctuations from LDV measurements as either granular temperature or granular turbulent kinetic energy. By applying these criteria to categorize the variations in the velocities for adjacent particles passing the sample volume, the resulting granular temperatures were found to be much smaller than the granular (particle) turbulent kinetic energy. Average values for the granular temperature in this system ranged between 0.02 to 0.1 m2/s2, while the particle turbulent kinetic energy ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 m2/s2. Both were dependent upon solids fraction; decreasing with increasing solids fraction. The velocity fluctuation data was also analyzed using the autocorrelation technique providing axial solids dispersion coefficients. These values range from 0.005 to 0.8 m2/s and were found to be a function of both the gas velocity and solids fraction. A method was developed to estimate the local solids fraction with the LDV data.},

The liquid spray, created by two-phase (gas–liquid) nozzles, forms a jet, i.e. a gas-rich cavity within the fluidized bed. Past studies have shown that good liquid–solid contact requires a large entrainment rate of particles into the jet, followed by intensive mixing of liquid droplets and entrained particles within the jet. The objective of this study is the experimental measurement of solids entrainment into spray jets. The specific application of interest is the enhancement of solids entrainment under conditions relevant to the fluid coking process.},

The state space analysis is used to study the time–space structure of the fluidized bed dynamics. A method for constructing Poincaré projections based on the join probability matrix computation is provided. The Kolmogorov entropy, K, and the correlation dimension, D2, are used to compute the invariant properties of the corresponding attractor. It is concluded that the local bubble dynamics has chaotic features and is responsible for the determinism found in pressure fluctuation signals.

A general semi-empirical correlation based on the Archimedes number which is valid over a range of particle size from 10 to 1000 pm is presented for the prediction of the minimum gas velocity required to pick up particles. Experiments have been carried out with fine particles (glass beads, alumina and coal) in a 52 mm id. transparent pipeline. Noteworthy is the existence of a minimum point in the curves of minimum pickup velocity as a function of particle diameter for particle diameters of approximately 100 Frn. Maximum conveyability is expected to occur at this particle size. Above and below this minimum point, higher gas velocities are required to pick up particles lying on the bottom of a pipe. Experiments in an actual pneumatic conveying system clarify the practical significance and usefulness of the minimum pickup velocity. Thus, it is suggested that the proposed test procedure be used as a unified technique in determining the minimum transport velocity of solid particles in horizontal pneumatic conveying systems.},

It starts with a discussion of the basic transport mechanisms in a granular flow. It continues with a discussion of contact mechanics – the way that individual particles see each other mechanically. It then discusses the historical limiting regimes of granular flow, the Quasistatic and the Rapid-Flow regimes. Finally, it concludes with a review of the Elastic picture of granular flow, which both unifies the Quasistatic and Rapid regimes and fills in the intervening space. It shows that the rheological behavior of granular systems changes with system scale constraints, and, in particular, that the materials behave differently under controlled-stress and controlled-concentration conditions. The Elastic model defines an entire flowmap of granular flow and thus allows one to place boundaries on where the Quasistatic and Rapid-Flow models (sometimes called kinetic theory models) are something of a red herring and cannot be applied to common granular flows.},

A thermodynamically consistent turbulent two-phase flow model that accounts for the phase fluctuation energy transport and interaction is used. The governing equation of the gas-phase is upgraded to a two-equation low Reynolds number turbulence closure model that can be integrated directly to the wall. A no-slip boundary condition for the gas-phase and slip-boundary condition for the particulate phase are used. The computational model is first applied to dilute gas-particle turbulent flow between two parallel vertical walls. The predicted mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles are compared with the experimental data of Tsuji et al. (1984) for vertical pipe flows, and good agreement is observed. Examples of additional flow properties such as the phasic fluctuation energy, phasic fluctuation energy production and dissipation, as well as interaction momentum and energy supply terms are also presented and discussed. Applications to the relatively dense gas-particle turbulent flows in a vertical channel are also studied. The model predictions are compared with the experimental data of Miller \& Gidaspow and reasonable agreement is observed. It is shown that flow behavior is strongly affected by the phasic fluctuation energy, and the momentum and energy transfer between the particulate and the fluid constituents.},

	abstract     = {A gas–liquid–solid three-phase circulating fluidized bed (GLSCFB) with 0.15 m in diameter and 4.35 m in height was employed to investigate the local phase hold-ups and liquid flow velocity. With styrene resin (dp = 1.45 mm, s = 1264 kg/m3) as solid phases, air as gas phase, and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium as liquid phase, local phase hold-ups are measured simultaneously by micro-conductivity probe technique under a wide range of operation conditions. Liquid flow velocity measurements have been performed using the electrolyte tracer measurement (ETM) technique. Measurement results in a GLSCFB riser presented here give an insight into the distribution laws of the local phase hold-ups and liquid velocity in radial directions. A closed Eulerian/Eulerian/Lagrangian model (E/E/L model) for simulating gas–liquid–solid three-phase local flow properties was developed by combining Two Fluid Model (TFM) and District Element Method (DEM). This model was based on the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. The motion of particles was described in the Lagrangian co-ordinates, while the gas phase and the liquid phase were described within the Eulerian co-ordinates. Based on IPSA and PSIC solution techniques, the program of simulating gas–liquid–solid local flow properties was achieved. The numerical simulating results of local phase hold-ups and local radial liquid velocity agreed well with the experimental data in a GLSCFB riser, and the applicability and reliability of this model were validated.},

This technique has presented several advantages: size reduction to the nanoscale, long-term kinetic stability, and high energy efficiency. However, in the reported literature, the physical and chemical stability has not been considered to define the quality of the prepared emulsions using HC. Therefore, it is now essential to understand the effect of several geometrical and operating parameters of HC on the physical and chemical stabilities of the prepared emulsions to cover their broader applications. This review attempts to answer this question through a critical analysis of previously reported work. This review gives an overview of the mechanism of cavitationally assisted emulsification, disruptive forces involved in the emulsification process, operating parameters affecting the emulsion stability, and the current research in this area. This review elucidates the possible HC-induced lipid degradation pathway during emulsification which has been overlooked so far. The possible mechanisms and operating conditions affecting the lipid oxidation during HC-assisted emulsification are presented. Some effective strategies and recommendations for obtaining the optimum operating parameters are presented. Future perspectives and directions for further investigations in this area are also discussed.},

Ideally, such technologies may preserve the original properties of the food products while reaching their primary target of application. Scope and approach At this point, hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) is recognized as one of the potential technologies for food processing since it provides effective conditions to activate and accelerate desired physiochemical transformations of treated medium. Cavitation phenomenon has been interestingly applied in the treatments and processing of foods towards homogenization (high pressure homogenizers, HPH)/mixing of systems, pasteurization/sterilization, degradation of target molecules, among other purposes. Therefore, this review aims to release the progress in applying HC-assisted technologies for the processing of food, beverages and other food items. Key findings and conclusion Apart from microorganism inactivation mechanisms in pasteurization and sterilization for foods, emulsion formation in food systems, extraction of bioactive compounds, and improvement of physicochemical properties of food systems are reviewed. Here, the advantages and drawbacks of HC compared to other technologies are also addressed and discussed. To finalize, according to the findings of this review, the future trends, perspectives, and research gaps are also given.},

A comprehensive model is developed in the present work in which a two-equation (k–ɛ) turbulence model is used for calculating the gas phase. In addition, a transport equation of particle phase turbulent kinetic energy is proposed and used for modeling the particle phase turbulence (kp model). Similar to that of the single gas phase, effective viscosity of the particle phase is the sum of the laminar viscosity caused by particle–particle collisions described by kinetic theory and the turbulent viscosity caused by collections of particles described by the kp model.

	abstract     = {The effects of scale-up on the fluid dynamics of circulating fluidized beds (CFB) are investigated using a single cold laboratory facility with the ability to recycle fluidization gas mixtures of adjustable density and viscosity. By matching five dimensionless parameters, experiments employing plastic, glass and steel powders achieve fluid dynamic similarity with high-temperature CFB risers of 0.32, 0.46 and 1 m diameter. Comparisons of results obtained with the plastic and glass powders indicate that static pressure and its fluctuations scale with the riser and particle diameters, respectively. Experiments with the steel powder exhibit incipient choking behavior consistent with the greater analogous bed size that they simulate. The onset of choking with plastic and steel powders is well predicted by the correlation of Yang [Powder TechnoZ., 35 (1983) 1431. Experiments with coated glass beads suggest that the magnitude of the particle Coulomb friction coefficient affects the fluid dynamics of the CFB in the limit where this coefficient is small.},

The removal of product hydrogen using palladium hydrogen membranes “breaks” the thermodynamic equilibrium barrier exists among the reversible reactions. Oxygen can be introduced into the adiabatic CFFBMR for oxidative reforming by direct oxygen (or air) feed and through dense perovskite oxygen membranes. The simulations show that high productivity of hydrogen can be obtained in the CFFBMR. The combination of these two di erent processes does not only enhance the hydrogen productivity but also save the energy due to the exothermicity of the oxidative reforming. Based on the preliminary investigations, four parameters (number of hydrogen membranes, number of oxygen membranes, direct oxygen feed rate and steam-to-carbon feed ratio) are carefully chosen as main variables for the process optimization. The optimized result shows that the hydrogen productivity (moles of hydrogen produced per hour per m3 of reactor) in the novel CFFBMR is about 8.2 times higher than that in typical industrial ÿxed-bed steam reformers.},

It is assumed that two factors mainly contribute to the pressure drop, i.e., the local loss and the loss along the distance. The former includes the expansion loss at the cyclone inlet and the contraction loss at the entrance of the outlet tube (or vortex finder). The latter consists of the swirling loss resulting from friction at the cyclone walls and the dissipation of gas dynamic energy in the outlet tube. By use of the measured results of the flow field in cyclones, the calculation methods for each loss have been developed. And a universal model to predict the cyclone pressure drop is thus obtained simply by summing each loss. A detailed comparison between the calculated and experimental results shows that this accurate model is suitable either for pure or for dust laden gases at normal or high temperatures and can meet the requirement of most cyclone designs.},

In the present work, an experimental study on the characteristics of SA penetration is carried out by operating a bubbling fluidized bed model. Floater, the ash formed from coal combustion, is used as experimental bed material. It has an average size of 0.83 mm and a low density of 620 kg/m3. Results indicate that the floater is more suitable to be operated in a spouted or a bubbling bed. Comparing with the conventional sand and FCC, the fluidizing characteristics of the floater are similar to those of Geldart Group D particles. From measurements of the solid concentration in the bed cross section at SA injection level by use of a solid concentration measuring thief probe of own design, the relation between SA jetting distance and SA velocity under different solid concentrations is obtained when the properties of bed material and SA ports are fixed. Furthermore, a dimensionless correlation is proposed for general cases. The results may provide a basis for further study.},

	abstract     = {Natural cavitation is defined as the formation of vapor bubbles in a flow due to the pressure falling below the liquid’s vapor pressure. The inception of the cavitation bubble is influenced by a lot of aspects, such as impurities, turbulence, liquid thermal properties, etc. In this paper, the exact difference method (EDM) and the Carnahan–Starling real-gas equation of state (EOS) are coupled in the Shan–Chen multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, which is validated as being suitable for simulating high liquid/vapor density ratio multiphase flows. The 2D cavitation “bubble” growth is simulated under a quiescent and shear flow in the inception stage. Besides yielding the large density ratio, the real-gas EOS also leads to apparently different compressibilities for liquid and vapor. The results agree with Rayleigh–Plesset predictions much better than those of a previous publication [X. Chen, Simulation of 2D cavitation bubble growth under shear flow by lattice Boltzmann model, Communications in Computational Physics 7 (2010) 212–223]. In the meantime, a comparison is conducted for single-bubble behavior under different shear rates, with reduced temperature T/Tcritical=0.6891 and relaxation time τ=1.0. The simulation results show that the cavitation bubble deformation is consistent with the bubble dynamics, D∝Ca, where D and Ca are the bubble deformation and the capillary number respectively. The shear rate hardly influences the bubble growth rate.},

Using lithium electrodeposition as an example, the proposed model is first verified by comparison with the Nernst equation in a 1D equilibrium system. The nonlinear electrochemical kinetics is also confirmed at nonequilibrium condition. The dendritic patterns are examined as a function of applied voltage and initial electrode surface morphology. A design map is proposed to tailor the electrode surface morphology and the applied voltage to avoid undesired dendritic patterns.},

	abstract     = {Quantifying biomarkers at the early stage of the disease is challenging due to the low abundance of biomarkers in the sample and the lack of sensitive techniques. This article reports the development of a novel microfluidic electrochemical biosensing platform to address this challenge. The electrochemical sensing is achieved by utilizing a micropillar array electrode (μAE) coated with 3D bimetallic Pt–Pd nanotrees to enhance the sensitivity. A bubble-based acoustic microstreaming technique is integrated with the device to increase the contact of analyte molecules with the surface of electrodes to further enhance the electrochemical performance. The current density of Pt–Pd NTs/μAE with acoustic microstreaming is nearly 22 times that of the bare planar electrode in potassium ferrocyanide solution. The developed biosensor has demonstrated excellent sensing performance. For hydrogen peroxide detection, both the Pt–Pd NTs/μAE and acoustic microstreaming contribute to the sensitivity enhancement. The current density of the Pt–Pd NTs/μAE is approximatively 28 times that of the bare μAE. With acoustic microstreaming, this enhancement is further increased by nearly 1.6 times. The platform has a linear detection range of 5–1000~μM with a LOD of 1.8~μM toward hydrogen peroxide detection, while for sarcosine detection, the linear range is between 5 and 100~μM and LOD is 2.2~μM, respectively. Furthermore, the sarcosine biosensing shows a high sensitivity of 667~μA~mM−1∙cm−2. Such a sensing platform has the potential as a portable device for high sensitivity detection of biomarkers.},

Downer is therefore acknowledged as a novel multiphase flow reactor with great potential in high-severity operated processes, such as the high temperature, ultra-short contact time reactions with the intermediates as the desired products. Typical process developments in industry have directed to (1) the new-generation refinery process for cracking of heavier feedstock to gasoline and light olefins (e.g., propylene) as by-products; and (2) coal pyrolysis in hydrogen plasma which opens up a direct means for producing acetylene, i.e., a new route to synthesize chemicals from a clean coal utilization process. This paper is to give a comprehensive review on the development of fundamental researches on downer reactors as well as the particular industrial demonstrations for the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy oils and coal pyrolysis in thermal plasma.},

The heart signals reach a maximum value when four cycles are completed and then are exponentially damped. The other features of the heart signal are a total duration of ≈20–24~ms and frequencies between 1.7 and 1.8~kHz.

	abstract     = {For combustion with CO2 capture, chemical-looping combustion (CLC) with inherent separation of CO2 is a promising technology. Two interconnected fluidized beds are used as reactors. In the fuel reactor, a gaseous fuel is oxidized by an oxygen carrier, e.g. metal oxide particles, producing carbon dioxide and water. The reduced oxygen carrier is then transported to the air reactor, where it is oxidized with air back to its original form before it is returned to the fuel reactor. The feasibility of using oxygen carrier based on oxides of iron, nickel, copper and manganese was investigated. Oxygen carrier particles were produced by freeze granulation. They were sintered at 1300 8C for 4 h and sieved to a size range of 125– 180 mm. The reactivity of the oxygen carriers was evaluated in a laboratory fluidized bed reactor, simulating a CLC system by exposing the sample to alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions at 950 8C for all carriers except copper, which was tested at 850 8C. Oxygen carriers based on nickel, copper and iron showed high reactivity, enough to be feasible for a suggested CLC system. However, copper oxide particles agglomerated and may not be suitable as an oxygen carrier. Samples of the iron oxide with aluminium oxide showed signs of agglomeration. Nickel oxide showed the highest reduction rate, but displayed limited strength. The reactivity indicates a needed bed mass in the fuel reactor of about 80 –330 kg/MWth and a needed recirculation flow of oxygen carrier of 4 – 8 kg/s, MWth.},

FCC reaction chemistry is speci"ed using the methods of structure-oriented-lumping (SOL) with over 60 reaction rules. Application of these rules results in a complex network of over 30,000 elementary chemical reactions. Both monomolecular reactions such as cracking, isomerization, and cyclization and bimolecular reactions such as hydrogen transfer, coking, and disproportionation are included. The e!ects of thermal cracking and metals-catalyzed dehydrogenation are also represented. Reactivity relationships have been developed to reduce the number of parameters required to specify the kinetic model. The kinetic parameters are regressed from data spanning a wide range of FCC process conditions, feed compositions, and catalyst formulations. The riser kinetic model is coupled with equipment models for key FCC components to form an integrated FCC process model. The model accurately predicts product yields, product composition, and product quality over a wide range of FCC process conditions and is capable of predicting the complex non-linear phenomena exhibited in commercial FCC operations such as steady-state multiplicity. The model can be used to predict the quality of FCC products made from di!erent crudes as well as to scope novel processing schemes for improving FCC product quality. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract     = {Experiments have shown that distributed secondary gas injection via a fractal injector in fluidized beds can significantly reduce the bubble size, and may also decrease the bubble fraction. In order to gain insight into the distribution of the gas between the phases and the mechanisms behind these effects simulations of small bubbling fluidized beds with one or two secondary gas injection points were carried out using a discrete particle model. Although the systems are very small, so that wall effects cannot be excluded, the model predicts that the bubble size and bubble fraction both decrease with secondary gas injection, while the gas flow through the dense phase increases. The secondary gas tends to stay in the dense phase, which limits the amount of gas available to form bubbles and is the main contributor to the decrease in the bubble size and fraction. The gas–solid contact improves as a result.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical study of particle–fluid flow in complex three-dimensional (3D) systems by means of Combined Continuum and Discrete Method (CCDM). In the CCDM, the motion of discrete particles phase is obtained by Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle and the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navier–Stokes equations that can be solved by the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This method has been increasingly used worldwide, but so far its application is limited to relatively simple flow systems. In this work, the simulation is achieved by incorporating a DEM code into the commercial CFD software package Fluent that can be readily used for complex CFD problems. The applicability of this development is demonstrated in the study of the particle–fluid flow in various 3D systems including pneumatic conveying bend, cyclone separator and circulating fluidized bed. It is shown that the numerical results are, either qualitatively or quantitatively depending on the availability of experimental data for comparison, in good agreement with those measured, and can generate information leading to better understanding of the internal flow structure of these systems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract     = {In this paper we introduce and validate a novel non-intrusive probe of the average kinetic energy, or granular temperature, of the particles at the wall of a gas fluidized bed. We present data on the granular temperature of monodispersed glass spheres which span region B, and extend into region A, of the Geldart powder classification. The underlying physics of the measurement is the acoustic shot noise excitation of the surface of the fluid bed vessel by random particle impact. Quantitative determination of the average particle granular temperature is obtained through independent measurement of the wall transfer function determining the coupling between the acoustic shot noise excitation at one location and the response of an accelerometer at another location. We validate the concept and calibration of this acoustic shot noise probe in the frequency range 10–20 kHz, through a comprehensive series of laboratory measurements with gasses and cylinders of significantly different acoustic properties. We demonstrate its utility by presenting the first data on the dependence of the granular temperature on gas flow and particle diameter and make the first observation of a change in the character of the fluidization transition from first order (hysteretic and discontinuous) to second order (reversible and continuous) for Geldart B glass spheres as the A/B boundary is approached. We observe a striking difference in the dependence of the granular temperature on gas flow between Geldart B and A glass spheres, that suggests a fundamental difference in particle dynamics between spheres in the two Geldart regimes. Finally we use the vibrational probe to study the time dependence of the granular temperature under bed collapse conditions when fluidizing gas is withdrawn rapidly from the system. We show an exponential time dependence with a time constant of the order of 100 ms, and demonstrate the consistency of this result with a Langevin equation for the sphere velocity with a time constant derived from the sphere fluctuation velocity and a collisional coefficient of restitution of 0.9. From these results for the granular temperature and a kinetic model for a dense granular gas, we present estimates for the inertial pressure, velocity of sound, viscosity, and diffusion constant of the dense phase of a gas fluidized bed as a function of particle diameter and gas superficial velocity. The implication of these results for current models of gas fluidized beds, and the fundamental basis of the Geldart classification is discussed.},

The granular temperature is obtained by Acoustic Shot Noise technology—namely power spectral analysis of the steady state vibrational energy of the wall excited by random sphere impact, and calibrated by hammer excitation over the wall. The new data extends to polymer and metallic spheres the experimental discovery of a 1996 paper of Cody et al. that the fluctuation velocity of Geldart B glass spheres when scaled to the gas superficial velocity, Us, is inversely proportional to sphere diameter, directly proportional to a fundamental length scale, DoB, and is a universal function of U = (Us / Umf). We also demonstrate that the new data is consistent with the diameter dependence of the fluctuation velocity that can be derived from both the 1997 paper of Menon and Durian, who measured random sphere motion near the wall through the spectroscopy of scattered laser light, and the 1992 paper of Rahman and Campbell, who measured the average granular pressure of random sphere impact on a porous steel membrane. While the inverse scaling of the fluctuation velocity with sphere diameter, and the existence of a fundamental length scale for gas fluidization, DoB, had not been a feature of any published fundamental model, or computer simulation, of the steady state granular temperature of spheres in gas fluidized beds, we show that it is a feature of two recent dense kinetic fluidization models published in 1999, by Buyevich and Kapbasov, and Koch and Sangani. Both theories implicitly define a fundamental length scale for the fluctuation velocity, D⁎ = (μf2 / ρp2g)1 / 3, where ρp is the sphere density, μf is the gas viscosity, and g is the laboratory gravitational field. The new data for polymer, glass, nickel and stainless steel spheres presented in this paper, defines DoB = (56 ± 2)D⁎. We use the Anderson–Jackson stability model to show that the length scale DoB, also defines a stability length scale, such that for D b DoB(D N DoB), the uniform dense phase of the fluidized bed is stable (unstable), against one dimensional, first order fluctuations in sphere concentration. The length scale, DoB is thus the theoretical equivalent to the empirical scaling length introduced by Geldart, DB/A, to distinguish spheres (D N DB/A) that bubble at fluidization, from spheres (D b DB/A) that fluidize before bubbling. Finally, we present new experimental data, on the remarkable changes in the granular temperature, bed expansion, and bed collapse time, between Geldart B and Geldart A monodispersed glass spheres, and compare that data to granular temperature, and bed expansion, for Geldart A rough, non-spherical, log-normal dispersed diameter catalytic particles.},

	abstract     = {Chemical-looping combustion is a two-stage process proposed as an alternative for the combustion of carbonaceous materials, such as natural gas or coal gas, for almost complete CO2 capture. In the reduction stage, the structural oxygen contained in the lattice of a reducible inorganic oxide, is used for combustion of the carbonaceous material. In the regeneration stage the oxygen carrier, found in a reduced state after the reduction stage, is regenerated with pure air to recover the physical and chemical properties of the carrier, ready to reinitiate a new cycle reduction-regeneration. In a typical multicycle reactor test, the carriers are subjected to accumulative chemical and thermal stresses and the performance will, probably, decay progressively with the number of cycles. The occurrence of some side reactions may limit the efficiency of the overall process in CO2 capture. In this paper, titania-supported iron oxides with different iron loadings have been tested in multicycle tests in a fixed-bed reactor at 900 °C and atmospheric pressure, as oxygen carriers for the chemical-looping combustion of methane. The study shows that the available oxygen for methane combustion in the reduction stage is lower than expected since the active phase interacts with the support forming FeTiO3 ilmenite. The reactivity of these iron based carriers in the reduction stage is independent on the iron oxide content but lower than that exhibited by other tested carriers, such as CuO or NiO. However, iron carriers are cheaper no showing any tendency to carbon deposition.},

Based on the mechanisms through which naphtha hydrocarbons are converted, we evaluated the best alternatives for processing these streams to produce light olefins and/or to reduce olefins content in commercial gasoline. The experimental set-up allowed us to simulate the cracking behaviour of the different naphtha streams in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit by different processing schemes. Results indicate that LSR only cracks at high severity, yielding large amounts of dry gas. Despite its high olefins content, FCCN practically does not crack when it is fed together with gas oil feed. When cracking FCCN alone at typical gas oil cracking conditions, olefins are transformed preferentially into naphtha-range isoparaffins and aromatics, and when cracking FCCN at high severity, olefins are transformed preferentially into propylene and butylenes. Finally, cracking naphtha in the stripper produces some propylene and increases the aromatics in the remaining gasoline.},

A clear understanding of such definitions and its consequences over the inversion temperature values is of major importance, as well as the way to estimate the inversion temperature of interest for a given practical evaporation process. Analytical expressions are proposed for some possible definitions of the inversion temperature. Special emphasis is devoted to the physical reasoning on the existence of the inversion temperature and how its value is affected by other variables such as humidity level, mass flow rate and geometry of the evaporative system.},

Single water droplets with a post-impact diameter of approximately 1 mm and n-heptane droplets approximately 5 mm in diameter were gently placed on aluminum and copper surfaces that were maintained at temperatures below the saturation temperatures of the liquids, and the evaporation was observed at atmospheric pressure. The droplets were videotaped throughout the entire evaporation process and transient variations of the diameter, height were measured. From the measured quantities, the contact angle and evaporation rates were calculated and used to predict the heat transfer rate on the surface. The results show that the trends in the wetted diameter, height and contact angle for water droplets are fundamentally different than the geometric changes for heptane droplets. Even though the evaporation rates of the n-heptane droplets were an order of magnitude greater than the water droplets, the heat fluxes for the n-heptane droplets are approximately an order of magnitude less than the water drops. The experimental results are compared with recent analytical models which predict the evaporation rates of small liquid droplets.},

Original signals could be resolved with respect first to scale, and then to time and amplitude into a periodic function and three irregular changes Žmicro-scale fluctuations, and meso-scale irregular amplitude and time fluctuations.. Statistical analysis indicated that the three kinds of irregular components are of random characteristics, with a complicated evolution of their probability density distributions with changing operating conditions. A new distribution function, called Compound Weibull distribution with seven parameters, was developed to describe the irregular fluctuations of flow structure, leading to a nonlinear dynamic model for simulating dynamic behaviors of heterogeneous flow structure in gas–solid fluidization, which has been coded into a software package. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

A multi-phase Eulerian-Eulerian model incorporating the kinetic theory for solid particles is used. Numerical results are obtained using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software FLUENT. The results indicate that solid entrainment in the ESE system is a strong function of both geometry and flow. The optimal entrainment is seen to occur when the ratio of the draft tube diameter D to separation distance I is approximately unity. At this value, the jet of injected gas is seen to spread fully into the opening of the draft tube causing the highest transport of solid particles through the tube. The entrainment is shown to increase with increasing jet velocity across the full range of flows considered. The results are consistent with similar experimental results.

Whereas there has been considerable effort to develop new biomass gasification, combustion, pyrolysis and bio-conversion processes, relatively few authors have characterized the relevant flow characteristics of biomass particles in fluidized beds or investigated measures that could assist in resolving flow issues. The limited work that has been reported on biomass fluidization primarily treats means of achieving fluidization, mixing and segregation. Most of the work has been in low-velocity fluidized beds, although circulating fluidized beds are also important.

For gravity liquid distributors, increasing the number of irrigation holes generally requires small hole diameters, which makes the equipment more sensitive to plugging. In this work, we disclose a new gravity liquid distributor that achieves large drip point densities without requiring smaller irrigation holes. This distributor is an adaptation of the classic orifice-pan type, in which we add a tree-like structure made of wires to spread the liquid dripping from the orifices. The liquid flows outside the wires and splits several times over the different branching levels before falling on the packed bed. From an orifice-pan configuration with drip point density of 736 pts/m2, we designed and constructed enhanced distributors with a theoretical irrigation density of 14,800 pts/m2. Performance comparison using a recently disclosed structured packing shows that these enhanced distributors can decrease HETP from 0.45~m to 0.27~m.},

	abstract     = {Time dependent flow often occurs in multiphase reactors. Examples of practical interest include pulsing flow in the case of cocurrent downflow of gas and liquid through a packed column, and voidage fluctuations in fluid-solid flows. In these examples, the local mean volume fractions and velocities of each phase can bc described by similar volume-averaged macroscopic models. In one dimension, fully developed flow takes the form of periodic waves travelling at constant speed through the bed. The shape of waves having observable wavelength is dictated by proximity to a heteroclinic connection in the travelling wave frame between two unstable uniform solutions having the same total volumetric flux. Consequently, the properties of the fully developed travelling waves can be determined by locating the two connected fixed points. A concise operating diagram can be constructed for the gas-liquid-packing system in terms of the externally applied fluxes of each phase. Qualitatively different solutions are obtained in each region of the operating diagram. Application of these methods to models for fluid-solid flow is also discussed.},

The gamma ray transmission profile of riser was evaluated and the main effects were identified. The standard uncertainty in the concentration values was evaluated as a function of the photopeak counts. A model was proposed to describe the profile curve of the empty riser as a function of the chordal length that fits experimental data adequately. A calibration of catalyst density carried out in static experiments and an integral evaluation of the radial scan were compared with punctual density. Under flow conditions the radial concentration distribution was measured at (2–16) kg/m3 and at (10–60) kg/m3 intervals. At two different airflow rates, concentration distribution tendency to move from the annular to the core region in the higher airflow, was observed.},

	abstract     = {Amine-functionalized metal organic frameworks (MOFs) such as Mg2(dobpdc) have shown some of the highest capacities for CO2 capture under simulated direct air capture (DAC) conditions, i.e., at a CO2 partial pressure at 0.4 mbar. The most widely studied materials of this kind have adsorption isotherms whose shape is controlled by the material’s underlying cooperative adsorption mechanism for CO2. Previous analyses of these materials, however, have focused primarily on equilibrium adsorption. Here, we study adsorption of CO2 in aminefunctionalized MOFs under ultradilute conditions relevant to DAC using a packed bed breakthrough system to understand the challenges of using these materials in practical separations. By examining the effects of flow rate, temperature, and CO2 concentration on the observed breakthrough profiles, we show how the isotherm shape, mass transfer resistances and adsorption/desorption kinetics impact the system’s performance. An empirical model for the packed bed that accounts for the cooperative reaction mechanism for adsorption of CO2 in N,N′-dimethyl ethylene diamine (MMEN)−Mg2(dobpdc) is developed. The kinetics of CO2 adsorption at CO2 concentrations of 400 ppm are characterized through an Avrami model, while at higher CO2 concentrations, a kinetic model based on a Michaelis−Menten expression is more successful. It is also suggested that, at low concentrations, mass transfer rate is limited by cooperative insertion of CO2. Overall, this work has identified the system performance (i.e., rate of CO2 extraction, CO2 capture fraction, and breakthrough curve types) for different feed concentrations of CO2. Critically, this work shows that the use of materials with stepped isotherm for applications such as DAC has some fundamental challenges that cannot be addressed by efforts that focus solely on modifying the overall equilibrium adsorption capacity or swing capacity.},

Two groups of bed materials (three quartz sand–spent fcc catalyst mixtures with different initial mass \% of sand and two coal–iron mixtures, one with almost same sizes but with different densities and the other having both different sizes and densities) were used. Using local axial mass \% of heavier/ coarser particles and their mean sizes the extent of segregation was evaluated. The influence of operating conditions like superficial gas velocity and solids circulation rate on segregation was examined and found that with their increase segregation effects generally tend to decrease and a uniform mixture conforming to initial composition of the mixture results.

Three quartz sand-FCC catalyst mixtures with different initial weight \% of sand and two coal-iron ore mixtures were used. The difference in local mean particle sizes of the components of the binary mixture has been observed in the riser of a circulating fluidized bed. Due to the larger mean particle size of sand and due to their lower solids density, the measured particle sizes of this fraction show higher values than FCC. For the same size of bed materials consisting of coal and iron ore mixture the variation of the mean particle size for the both has found to be very narrow. Again the axial segregation for the coal/iron ore mixture has been studied in terms of terminal settling velocity of the particles with the aid of a laser particle analyzer. The result showed a continuous classification of bed materials along the riser of a CFB.},

To study the flow regimes, the transport velocity (Utr) was determined from the ( PL/L)–Ug–Gs relationship. The gas velocity at which solid hold-up in the upper dilute region exhibits a maximum value is defined as the fast transition velocity (UTF) and the transition velocity to pneumatic transport as UFD.

It is shown that the simplest version of the core-annulus model gives the correct magnitudes of slip velocity and average solids hold-up. The anomaly in the core-annulus model, whereby diffusion of particles is towards the region of high solids concentration, is ascribed to the presence of clusters, diffusion towards the wall occurring in the dilute regions between clusters. The clusters are conjectured to be fragments of the relatively dense particle film falling near the wall: this film is shown to have features in common with a film of ordinary liquid flowing down a vertical surface. Implications for scale-up are discussed, using published data showing that very large CFBs exhibit core-annulus flow. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

	abstract     = {Gas–solid heat transfer in rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry is theoretically and numerically investigated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the particle bed temperature response to a step change in the fluidization gas temperature are presented to illustrate the gas–solid heat transfer characteristics. A comparison with conventional fluidized beds is made. Rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry can operate at centrifugal forces multiple times gravity, allowing increased gas–solid slip velocities and resulting gas–solid heat transfer coefficients. The high ratio of the cylindrically shaped particle bed “width” to “height” allows a further increase of the specific fluidization gas flow rates. The higher specific fluidization gas flow rates and increased gas–solid slip velocities drastically increase the rate of gas–solid heat transfer in rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry. Furthermore, both the centrifugal force and the counteracting radial gas–solid drag force being influenced by the fluidization gas flow rate in a similar way, rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry offer extreme flexibility with respect to the fluidization gas flow rate and the related cooling or heating. Finally, the uniformity of the particle bed temperature is improved by the tangential fluidization and resulting rotational motion of the particle bed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The flow in these systems depends strongly on particle–particle interaction and gas–particle interaction. For this reason, proper closure relations for these two interactions are vital for reliable predictions on the basis of continuum models. Gas–particle interaction can be studied with the use of the lattice Boltzmann model (LBM), while the particle–particle interaction can suitably be studied with a discrete particle model. In this work it is shown that the discrete particle model, utilizing a LBM based drag model, has the capability to generate insight and eventually closure relations in processes such as mixing, segregation and homogeneous fluidization.},

Although radial uniformity is observed in both reactors, the radial distribution of products is more uniform in the downer than in the riser. At the same feed conversion, about 5.5 wt.\% higher gasoline yield is predicted in the downer due to the less axial backmixing and flatter radial distribution of gas– solids velocity and solids concentration. The simulation results also show that the radial gas dispersion plays an important role in determining the radial distribution of products. The profiles of gasoline in both riser and downer are calculated, and the simulation results of different models compared, showing that the consideration of radial non-uniformity is necessary. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract     = {Particle degradation can be a significant issue in particulate solids handling and processing, particularly in pneumatic conveying systems, in which high-speed impact is usually the main contributory factor leading to changes in particle size distribution (comparing the material to its virgin state). However, other factors may strongly influence particles breakage as well, such as particle concentrations, bend geometry, and hardness of pipe material. Because of such complex influences, it is often very difficult to predict particle degradation accurately and rapidly for industrial processes. In this article, a general method for evaluating particle degradation due to high-speed impacts is described, in which the breakage properties of particles are quantified using what are known as ‘‘breakage matrices.’’ Rather than a pilot-size test facility, a bench-scale degradation tester has been used. Some advantages of using the bench-scale tester are briefly explored. Experimental determination of adipic acid has been carried out for a range of impact velocities in four particle size categories. Subsequently, particle breakage matrices of adipic acid have been established for these impact velocities. The experimental results show that the ‘‘breakage matrices’’ of particles is an effective and easy method for evaluation of particle degradation due to high-speed impacts. The possibility of the ‘‘breakage matrices’’ approach being applied to a pneumatic conveying system is also explored by a simulation example.},

In these initial reactions, the gasoline selectivity is low in favor of a higher gas production. After this initial conversion, the reactions taking place can be described by first-order reaction kinetics with a constant catalyst activity as a function of residence time. When a catalyst is used in a second run without regeneration, the activity is still significant, although much lower than that after regeneration. The overall selectivity of the reused catalyst is almost identical to the overall selectivity of the regenerated catalyst.

While traditional full-order models based on the Navier–Stokes equations are not feasible, advanced model reduction techniques can be inefficient for active control tasks, especially with strong non-linearity and convection-dominated phenomena. Using convolutional recurrent autoencoder network architectures, deep-learning-based reduced-order models have been recently shown to be effective while performing several orders of magnitude faster than full-order simulations. However, these models encounter significant challenges outside the training data, limiting their effectiveness for active control and optimization tasks. In this study, we aim to improve the extrapolation capability by modifying the network architecture and integrating coupled space–time physics as an implicit bias. Reduced-order models via deep learning generally employ decoupling in spatial and temporal dimensions, which can introduce modeling and approximation errors. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel technique for learning coupled spatial–temporal correlation using a three-dimensional convolution network. We assess the proposed technique against a standard encoder–propagator–decoder model and demonstrate a superior extrapolation performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the three-dimensional convolution network, we consider a benchmark problem of the flow past a circular cylinder at laminar flow conditions and use the spatiotemporal snapshots from the full-order simulations. Our proposed three-dimensional convolution architecture accurately captures the velocity and pressure fields for varying Reynolds numbers. Compared to the standard encoder–propagator–decoder network, the spatiotemporal-based three-dimensional convolution network improves the prediction range of Reynolds numbers outside of the training data.},

The Eulerian description of the gas flow is based on lattice-Boltzmann discretization of the filtered Navier–Stokes equations, where the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model has been used to represent the effect of the filtered scales. Through this large-eddy representation of the gas flow, solid particles with different sizes are tracked. By viewing the individual particles (of which there are some 107 inside the cyclone at any moment in time) as clusters of particles (parcels), we study the effect of particle-to-gas coupling on the gas flow and particle behavior at appreciable mass-loading (0.05 and 0.1). The presence of solid particles causes the cyclone to lose some swirl intensity. Furthermore, the turbulence of the gas flow gets strongly damped. These two effects have significant consequences for the way the particles of different sizes get dispersed in the gas flow. It is anticipated that the collection efficiency gets affected in opposite senses: negatively by the loss-of-swirl, positively by the reduced turbulence.},

We identify regimes with preference for horizontal settling and vertical settling of the cylinders dependent on the overall solids volume fraction (in the range of 0–0.58) and the Archimedes number of the cylinders. These insights we use to interpret the behavior of fluidized suspensions consisting of mixtures of spheres and cylinders with an emphasis on cylinder orientation distributions and slip velocities between solids and liquid phase. The three-dimensional and time-dependent simulations explicitly resolve the solid-liquid interfaces by applying an immersed boundary method contained in a lattice-Boltzmann flow solver.},

Identification of dominant energy containing structures with their characterization in terms of fractal spectra have been carried out for industrially important equipment exhibiting turbulent behavior. These include annular centrifugal contactor, jet loop reactor, ultrasound reactor, channel flow, stirred tank and bubble column reactor. The characterization of their dynamics based on denoising the data and studying the local energy along the WT scales show sensitive variation and this helps in identifying the size and shape of structures. A dependency is seen between mixing time and the higher order moments of length scale distribution, viz., skewness and kurtosis and a generalized correlation has been built up for important types of equipment and associated flow parameters. The correlation is not only based on the knowledge of reactor geometry and operating conditions but also on the flow structures via their statistical parameters. Wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) methodology has been used to study the evolution of structures and their interaction in a reduced dimensionality by evaluating the fractal spectra. Classification studies have been carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) of the fractal spectra. The results obtained show clear classes for the six types of equipments and delineate regimes to obtain benchmark patterns of flow hydrodynamics based on PCA co-ordinates. This methodology offers a generalized way for the optimal design and operation of different types of reactors.},

The tangential injection of the fluidization gas fluidizes the particles tangentially and induces a rotating motion, generating a centrifugal field. Radial fluidization of the particle bed is created by introducing a radially inwards motion of the fluidization gas, towards a centrally positioned chimney. Correctly balancing the centrifugal force and the radial gas–solid drag force requires an optimization of the fluidization chamber design for each given type of particles. Solids feeding and removal can be continuous, via one of the end plates of the fluidization chamber.},

Problem generators of standard exercises, as an additional complement to the exercises that are used in the lectures, seminars, and assignments to facilitate the learning of the students, have been developed. These generators provide exercises to students with “unlimited” initial values (with certain restrictions). The software that was used to develop these materials was Jupyter Notebook, which runs under the Python 3.6 language. The problem generators can be classified into fixed problem generators, case-based generators, and random problem generators. Additionally, lecturing tools have been developed to support teaching using live/interactive examples. These examples can learning understanding of various topics of the courses.},

In addition to plant seeds, green biomass from dedicated crops or green agricultural waste is also available as an alternative source to fulfill the protein and nutrient needs of humans and animals. The development of extraction and precipitation methods (such as microwave coagulation) for chloroplast and cytoplasmic proteins, which constitute the bulk of leaf protein, will allow the production of leaf protein concentrates (LPC) and protein isolates (LPI). Obtained LPC serves as a sustainable alternative source of animal-based protein besides being an important source of many vital phytochemicals, including vitamins and substances with nutritional and pharmacological effects. Along with it, the production of LPC, directly or indirectly, supports sustainability and circular economy concepts. However, the quantity and quality of LPC largely depend on several factors, including plant species, extraction and precipitation techniques, harvest time, and growing season. This paper provides an overview of the history of green biomass-derived protein from the early green fodder mill concept by Károly Ereky to the state-of-art of green-based protein utilization. It highlights potential approaches for enhancing LPC production, including dedicated plant species, associated extraction methods, selection of optimal technologies, and best combination approaches for improving leaf protein isolation.},

	abstract     = {The gas–solid mass transfer in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser flow is both structure-dependent and dynamic in nature. Recent progress in multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allows fresh insight into the dynamic flow structure, yet its influence on the mass transfer remains to be settled. To this end, a multiscale mass transfer model is established in this paper based on the extended framework of the energyminimization multiscale (EMMS) model. The relevant algorithm named EMMS/mass is proposed for CFD-coupled mass transfer computation. Two testing cases accounting for sublimation of naphthalene and decomposition of ozone, respectively, are presented to demonstrate the characters of the model. It is shown that structural consideration can have significant effects on the model prediction. The normally used Reynolds number is not adequate to characterize these effects, while the combination of gas velocity and solids flux seems to capture the structural effects and allows to explain the variation of Sherwood number reported for CFB risers in the literature. Sub-grid coupling of this multiscale mass transfer model and CFD approach can be expected to provide a promising tool to probe the dynamic and structure-dependent nature of mass transfer in CFB risers.},

	abstract     = {This article is to test the EMMS-based multiscale mass transfer model through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of ozone decomposition in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor. Three modeling approaches, namely types A, B and C, are classified according to their drag coefficient closure and mass transfer equations. Simulation results show that the routine approach (type C) with assumption of homogeneous flow and concentration overestimates the ozone conversion rate, introduction of structure-dependent drag force will improve the model prediction (type B), while the best fit to experimental data is obtained by the multiscale mass transfer approach (type A), which takes into account the sub-grid heterogeneity of both flow and concentration. In general, multiscale behavior of mass transfer is more distinct especially for the dense riser flow. The fair agreement between our new model with literature data suggests a fresh paradigm for the CFB related reaction simulation.},

The performance of the circular arc curve chamber SEON was studied numerically. Taking the vapor volume distribution and the vapor volume fraction as the evaluation indexes, the influences of the chamber wall profile on the cavitation performance of the circular arc curve chamber SEON were analyzed. In addition, it was compared with the broken-line chamber SEON. The numerical results show that the cavitation performance of the circular arc curve chamber SEON is first enhanced and then weakened by increasing the circular arc radius. The circular arc curve chamber structure can form a larger central cavitation volume in the nozzle, which improves the cavitation performance of the SEON. When the circular arc radius is 2 mm, the cavitation area and the turbulent kinetic energy of the circular arc curve chamber SEON increase by 122.5\% and 16.9\%.},

	abstract     = {Changes in the quality of gas—solids contact in going from a 0.05 m dia. fluidised bed of fine iron oxide powder to one with a diameter of 0.64 m have been quantified. An inert gas tracer was employed in the dynamic mode to generate residence time characteristics for each system, and model fitting was used to estimate mass transfer from the bubbles to the dense phase. A comprehensive model screening is carried out to identify the most reasonable modelling approach. Four currently popular models are taken from the literature, and a fifth, based on multiple plug flow units in parallel for the bubble phase, is put forward. This model is termed the multiple bubble-track or MBT model, and screening results show that it describes this particular system on both scales of operation with marginally greater precision than the well-known May—Van Deemter [2, 3] model and significantly greater precision than any of the other three models. This suggests that the multiple plug flow concept is sound and mechanistically more correct than the assumption on which the other models are based. Crossflow ratios estimated on the basis of the MBT model point to the existence of a strong scale-up effect for this fine, dense particle system. As expected [20, 21], most of the crossflow activity occurs in the grid region: this holds for both small and larger beds. The upper regions of the large bed appear to be fairly inactive from an interphase mass transfer point of view and the presence or otherwise of vertical coils is shown to have very little effect on crossflow.},

A dynamic gas tracer system based on a pair of rapid-response mass spectrometers was employed, and the tracer itself was argon delivered in the form of a pulse. Concentration- time responses were recorded at two elevations, and system transfer characteristics were extracted in the form of variance increase and peak-to-peak velocity. The variance change in the bed was found to decrease with increasing gas velocity and to increase initially with increasing solids circulation. This increase with a rise in solids flux appeared to weaken at high solids mtes. Peak-to-peak velocities were found to display a maximum at a superficial gas velocity of around 4 - 5 m/s and, when the variance data are processed in to the form of axial dispersion coefficients, a similar peak emerges. One possible explanation is that a radially symmetrical core/annulus structure exists at low velocities, and that beyond about 5 m/s this structure gives way to a more random lateral distribution of lean and dense regions. A possible distinction between “fast fluidisation”and “riser transport” is suggested on this basis.},

Contact efIiciencies have been measured for two grades of sand (140 and 275 pm) and 71 pm FCC catalyst. The measurement technique is based on hot gas as a reacting tracer, with detection by a shrouded rapid-response thermocouple. The rate at which hot gas is thermally equilibrated with the bed is measured and this is interpreted in terms of the degree to which gas and solid come into intimate contact. The results show that, as particles become finer, contact efficiencies improve. However, this improvement is significantly less than the corresponding increase in total gas-solid surface area in the system. Finer particles are likely to form clusters or streamers more readily, and it appears that coarse particles are more surface-efficient in that they expose a greater proportion of external surface to the main gas stream. In other words, the difference in contact efficiency performance between a fine and a coarse powder is reduced by the tendency of the finer powder to aggregate more strongly.},

	abstract     = {The effects of the catalyst-to-oil ratio (CTO), temperature, residence time, and feed composition on the product selectivities and product distribution in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) will be discussed. Under simulated realistic conditions two distinctive time frames can be identified. In the ‘initial time-frame’, during the first 50 ms of catalyst-oil contact, radical reactions play an important role, leading to the large extent of unselective conversion of the feed to coke, H2, and C1–C4. The presence of catalyst external surface area enhances radical reactions. Coke deposits mainly on the outer surface of the catalyst particle, thereby reducing its accessibility and apparent catalytic cracking activity. After 50 ms, during the ‘steady-state time-frame’, radical reactions play a negligible role and no coke, H2, and C1–C2 are formed. In this stage, b-scission is dominant. A lumped kinetic scheme is proposed to describe the observed phenomena and how gasoline yield penalties could be avoided in commercial risers. Calculations on feed reactivities and mass-transfer have been made in order to describe the processes taking place on a molecular scale.},

Rowe et al. demonstrated experimentally that the dominant mechanisms of mixing in the bulk of the bed are drift, or permanent displacement of particles, induced by the bubbles, and the return flow it generates [P. Rowe, B. Partridge, A. Cheney, G. Henwood, E. Lyall, The mechanics of solids mixing in fluidised beds, Trans. Inst. Chem. Eng. 43 (1965) 271 – 286] [1].

Henwood, E. Lyall, The mechanics of solids mixing in fluidised beds, Trans. Inst. Chem. Eng. 43 (1965) 271 – 286] [1].

The paper describes the early development of the technique, summarizes several experiments which show how dilute particle loadings can significantly alter the turbulence, and demonstrates how the point-particle method fails when the particles are comparable in scale to the small scale turbulence. High-resolution simulations and experiments which demonstrate the importance of the flow details around individual particles are described.

Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) and four turbulence models namely; standard k-ε model, RNG (Renormalization Group) based k-ε model, Low Re k-ε model and an extended version of the standard k-ε model are adopted. The effects of particle rotation and lift forces are included in the particle tracking model. The present predictions are compared with published experimental data for single-phase and two-phase flows. The comparisons show that the RNG based k-ε model predicts the flow behaviour better than other models. Furthermore, the particles concentration and velocity are compared very well with published data. The effects of inlet gas velocity, bend geometry, loading ratio and particle size on the flow behaviour and bend pressure drop are also discussed. The results show that the flow behaviour is greatly affected by these parameters.},

System theory is used as the common language to unify concepts, and emphasis is given to bifurcation, chaos as the basis of behavioral complexity and the configuration of processes as the basis for structural complexity. Natural processes are grouped under biocomplexity, while man-made processes are treated as complexity alone. We restrict our attention in this paper to systems that do not change their structure during the process, so that self-organizational criticality is explained, but not utilized. Computational complexity is intrinsically inherent in all the processes we consider, but it is not given much attention in this paper. Despite these severe limitations on the scope of our paper, the subject is still quite complex and branched, and this paper tries to bring it to the attention and interest of a wider spectrum of chemical/biological engineers in both academia and industry.},

In present review, an attempt has been made to scrutinize the applications of artificial neural network (ANN) as an intelligent system-based method for optimizing and the prediction of different SE devices’ performance, like solar collectors, solar assisted heat pumps, solar air and water heaters, photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems, solar stills, solar cookers, and solar dryers.

Different statistical criteria that used to assess the performance of artificial neural network in modeling SE systems have been introduced. Previous studies have reported that artificial neural network is a useful technique to predict and optimize the performance of different solar energy devices. Important conclusions and suggestions for future research are also presented.},

In this work, we present a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to study the fluid dynamic field inside the nozzle of a cavitating injector. The formation of the cavitating region is determined via a multi-phase approach based on the Shan-Chen equation of state. The results obtained by the LBM simulation show satisfactory agreement with both numerical and experimental data. In addition, numerical evidence of bubble break-up, following upon flow-induced cavitation, is also reported.},

They have to be taken into account in SMB numerical models to scale-up processes. In the present work, CFD is used as an intermediate step to develop a 1D model simple enough to be used for cyclic SMB simulations while being able to represent realistic hydrodynamics. First, a mock-up representative of an industrial SMB is used to perform residence time distribution (RTD) experiments and to provide validation data. Experiments are well predicted by a CFD model including porous media and turbulent zones, allowing to consider CFD simulations as references to fit simpler models. The moments of internal age distribution are characterized following the calculation method developed by Liu and Tilton, 2010. AIChE J. 56(10), 2561–2572, which allows to estimate the degree of mixing (Liu, 2012. Chem. Eng. Sci. 69(1), 382–393) inside adsorption beds. A major result is that RTD and degree of mixing inside adsorption beds are well described by a 1D multiexit model, unlike classical dispersed plug flow models (Ruthven and Ching, 1989) that were generally used to simulate SMB processes. Additionally, a numerical method was developed which is able to reproduce the RTD with steady state simulations.},

The paper outlines the numerical models available for analyzing these processes and presents examples of such methodology. The unprecedented growth in computer capability has resulted in efficient simulations of most transport phenomena. The aerospace’s interest in high-pressure turbulent combustion has created efficient computational tools for analyzing run-away-reactions in the process industries. Practical turbulence models, generalized thermodynamic properties, and extensive chemical kinetics data bases are currently used in three-dimensional, steady-state simulations. However, industrial needs have challenged CFD modelers to improve their flow solvers in order to simulate flows with more complicated physics, such as spray combustion, acoustic waves, transient start-up and shut-down, and flow instabilities. In addition, the practicality and efficiency of numerical simulations are highly dependent on the submodels employed, such as reaction mechanisms and turbulence models. There has been some progress in generalizing CFD tools, but more development is needed. Most of all, more high-quality and critical test data are required to validate the CFD simulations of complex processes. The laminar transport equations have been averaged by various means to locally describe both turbulent and multiphase flows. Spray combustion, stirred-tank reactors, fluidization of catalytic beds, and highly exothermic supercritical reactors are among the several validated examples, which illustrate today’s technology. The designer’s access to public-domain, open-source software offers powerful methodology for his use. Such software and the variety of available modeling techniques will be inventoried to demonstrate the scope of computational transport methodology. The current state of CFD models will be assessed to address the need for future research.},

	abstract     = {,  We perform direct numerical simulations of a gas bubble dissolving in a surrounding liquid. The bubble volume is reduced due to dissolution of the gas, with the numerical implementation of an immersed boundary method, coupling the gas diffusion and the Navier–Stokes equations. The methods are validated against planar and spherical geometries’ analytical moving boundary problems, including the classic Epstein–Plesset problem. Considering a bubble rising in a quiescent liquid, we show that the mass transfer coefficient kLkLk\_L can be described by the classic Levich formula kL=(2/√π)√DlU(t)/d(t)kL=(2/π−−√)DlU(t)/d(t)−−−−−−−−−−√k\_L = (2/\textbackslash sqrt \{\{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash pi\} \})\textbackslash sqrt \{\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l\textbackslash,U(t)/d(t)\}, with d(t)d(t)d(t) and U(t)U(t)U(t) the time-varying bubble size and rise velocity, and DlDl\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l the gas diffusivity in the liquid. Next, we investigate the dissolution and gas transfer of a bubble in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence flow, extending Farsoiya et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 920, 2021, A34). We show that with a bubble size initially within the turbulent inertial subrange, the mass transfer coefficient in turbulence kLkLk\_L is controlled by the smallest scales of the flow, the Kolmogorov ηη\textbackslash eta and Batchelor ηBηB\textbackslash eta \_B microscales, and is independent of the bubble size. This leads to the non-dimensional transfer rate Sh=kLL⋆/DlSh=kLL⋆/Dl\{Sh\}=k\_L L\^\textbackslash star /\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l scaling as Sh/Sc1/2∝Re3/4Sh/Sc1/2∝Re3/4\{Sh\}/\{Sc\}\^\{1/2\} \textbackslash propto \{Re\}\^\{3/4\}, where ReRe\{Re\} is the macroscale Reynolds number Re=urmsL⋆/νlRe=urmsL⋆/νl\{Re\} = u\_\{rms\}L\^\textbackslash star /\textbackslash nu \_l, with urmsurmsu\_\{rms\} the velocity fluctuations, L∗L∗L\^* the integral length scale, νlνl\textbackslash nu \_l the liquid viscosity, and Sc=νl/DlSc=νl/Dl\{Sc\}=\textbackslash nu \_l/\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l the Schmidt number.

In general, it is achieved by combining the discrete flow of a particle phase with the continuum flow of a gas phase; however, different model formulations have been used in the literature, and their effect is not fully understood. This paper attempts to address this matter. The governing equations used are related to the so-called Model A and Model B which give different interpretations of particlefluid interaction in the well-established two fluid model. Their difference is quantified by a numerical simulation of two cases: fluidization of mono- or bi-sized particles. Physical experiments are conducted to help clarify this matter.},

The influences of flow rate ratio, surface tension, wetting properties, and rheological characteristics of the fluid on the two-phase flow are analyzed. The results indicate that the flow pattern transfers from slug flow to dry-plug flow with a sufficiently small capillary number. Due to the presence of three-phase contact lines, the contact angle has a more significant effect on the dry-plug flow pattern than on the slug flow pattern. The deformation of the front and rear meniscus of a bubble in the shear-thinning fluid can be explained by the variation of the capillary number. The reduced viscosity and increased contact angle are beneficial for the drag reduction in a microchannel. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of the current method to simulate the gas-liquid two-phase flow in a microchannel.},

An alternative method of investigation is followed which takes into consideration the existence of a finite velocity interval, bounded by the “initial” and “final fluidization velocity” of the mixture, along which the whole process of fluidization has place. The results of a wide series of experiments demonstrate that this alternative approach allows recognizing the independent variables of binary fluidization; they also highlight the differences of behaviour between density- and size-segregating beds.},

The large range of length scales and timescales in turbulent multiphase flows makes direct numerical simulation of the microscale governing equations intractable for many applications. In this article we review a systematic approach for developing large-eddy-simulation (LES) tools for dispersed multiphase flows starting from the microscale model. A key intermediate step is the mesoscopic model for the dispersed phase, formulated in terms of kinetic equations, that contains the physical models for the flow. Owing to the phase-space variables, direct solution of the mesoscopic model is usually intractable, and additional mathematical approximations are introduced to arrive at a macroscopic model. We show that self-conditioned LES models can be derived for both the mesoscopic and macroscopic models, but the former is preferred to ensure consistency and physical accuracy. The principal difficulties and open challenges in closing the LES model equations are highlighted.},

To achieve the purpose, some modified work is conducted. The equilibrium distribution function for density is modified in the developed model. The scheme of multiple-relaxation-time is applied to deal with the single-phase and perturbation collision operators to enhance the algorithm stability, and a simple correction term is incorporated into the single-phase operator. In addition, the finite-difference method is adopted to solve the temperature field. The developed model is first used to simulate the layered two-phase flow in a horizontal channel to test the density ratio that can be achieved without temperature effect. Then two classical thermocapillary flow problems of thermocapillary-driven flow in a heated microchannel and thermocapillary migration of a deformable droplet or bubble are simulated, and the model is proven to successfully simulate the thermocapillary flows with density ratios up to 10.},

However, despite their ubiquity, multi-fluid systems with the drop and pool consisting of different liquids are far less well understood. Our hypothesis is that the post-impact dynamics greatly depends on the pool-to-droplet viscosity ratio μp/μd, which we explore over a range of six orders of magnitude using a combination of experiments and theoretical approaches (mathematical modelling and direct numerical simulation). Our findings indicate that in this scenario the splashing threshold and the composition of the ejecta sheet are controlled by the viscosity ratio. We uncover that increasing the pool viscosity decreases the splashing threshold for high viscosity pools (μp/μd≳35) when the splash comes from the droplet. By contrast, for low viscosity pools, the splash sheet comes from the pool and increasing the pool viscosity increases the splashing threshold. Surprisingly, there are conditions for which no splashing is observed under the conditions attainable in our laboratory. Furthermore, considering the interface velocity together with asymptotic arguments underlying the generation of the ejecta has allowed us to understand meaningful variations in the pressure during impact and rationalise the observed changes in the splashing threshold.},

It is thus necessary to estimate the solid concentration pro"le for the design of fast \#uidization reactors. Although the in\#uence of pressure or the density ratio between \#uid and solid on the particle concentration in the circulating \#uidized bed has been experimentally investigated, it has not yet been fully understood theoretically. Not a few plant development units now in operation have, however, been designed on empirical experiences supported by basic experiments. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the in\#uence of the \#uid/solid density ratio on the vertical concentration pro"le by application of the Growing Chain Model. It is found that the distance from the riser top to the point where solid concentration attains actually its "nal value, decreases with increase in the \#uid/solid density ratio, thus making the bed more uniform vertically. The "nal concentration is independent of the \#uid/solid density ratio. These "ndings coincide with some experiments by other investigators. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract     = {Solid particles of cylindrical shape play a significant role in many separations processes. Explicit equations for the drag coefficient and the terminal velocity of free-falling cylindrical particles have been developed in this work. The developed equations are based on available experimental data for falling cylindrical particles in all flow regimes. The aspect ratio (i.e., length-over-diameter ratio) has been used to account for the particle shape. Comparisons with correlations proposed by other researchers using different parameters to account for the geometry are presented. Good agreement is found for small aspect ratios, and increasing differences appear when the aspect ratio increases. The aspect ratio of cylindrical particles satisfactorily accounts for the geometrical influence on fluid flow of settling particles.},

	abstract     = {The paper presents mathematical models of a measuring system for real-time monitoring the net electric charge, the mass flow rate or concentration of charged particles, and the mean flow velocity of the particles in a pipe. The main problem lies in proper defining and establishing the unambiguous relationships between the electric parameters of a measuring system, which uses a probe, sensor or transducer based on electrostatic induction. Such devices are non-contact, non-obstructive ones and are intended for the two-phase flow metering of charged solids in pipelines. The probe’s output potential (voltage) is derived as a function of an equivalent point charge representing the net charge of a charged particle column within the probe’s sensing zone and flowing in a real pipe as well as a function of the net charge of this column and its dynamic space density. The relationships are established for the above three forms of charge travelling rectilinearly along or parallel to the probe’s geometrical axis in a laminar or fully developed turbulent flow. The models presented here show a useful, helpful approach to the modelling of non-contact, non-intrusive measuring systems based on electrostatic induction. The substantial role the capacitance of the electrostatic flow probe itself and the whole measuring system plays in the physical process of electrostatic induction of charge and in the mathematical modelling of the probe and system is interpreted. The capacitance influence on the system bandwidth is also discussed.},

However, instead of requiring a function of three variables (Re, Kb KJ to predict drag, a function only of the generalized Reynolds number ReKIK, is needed. The shape factors KI and Kg are then modeled as functions of the geometric shape descriptors’ sphericity and the projected area in the direction of motion.

Results showed that overcracking of desired products, such as diesel or light fuel oil, occurs and the optimum yields of desirable FCC products could be achieved at a critical riser height of less than 20 m above the feed inlet. This suggests that injection of quenching media above the critical riser height can be an effective option for optimizing the yields of desirable products. The reactionterminating technique conducted in a commercial FCC riser reactor, using light waste oil, straight-run gasoline, and desalted water as quenching media produced favorable results. Light fuel oil yields increased by 1.3 wt\% and 0.95 wt\% for using the first two quenching media. Liquefied cracking gas yields increased by 0.43 wt\% and 1.03 wt\%, whereas the yields of dry gas and coke decreased slightly. Desalted water produced better results than either light waste oil or straight-run gasoline. The improvements of gasoline and liquefied gas yields using desalted water are 0.95\% and 0.49\% more than those of using straight-run gasoline, respectively.},

The modified Gidaspow drag model based on the effective mean diameter of the particle clusters predicted the expected bubbling fluidization behavior and bed expansion. Compared with the bed densities of 650.900 kg/m3 in the emptycylinder stripper, bed densities in the V-baffled stripper were 600.800 kg/m3 at the superficial gas velocity of 0.10–0.20 m/s. The overall trend of the time-averaged bed density at various superficial gas velocities were in agreement with the experimental data. The results illustrated that internal baffles had an important effect on the fluidization hydrodynamics. Internal baffles improved break-up and redistribution of bubbles and intensified the gas–solid contact. The simulation results also indicated that appropriate modification of the internal configuration eliminated the dead flow region in the strippers, and enhanced the gas–solid mixing remarkably, showing benefit for the mass and heat transfer in the fluidized bed.},

Nitrogen adsorption, XRD and H2-TPR analysis indicated that La2O3-modified SiO2 had higher surface area, strengthened interaction between Ni and support, and improved dispersion of Ni. CO2-TPD found that La2O3 increased the alkalescence of SiO2 and improved the activation of CO2. Coking reaction (via both temperature-programmed surface reaction of CH4 (CH4TPSR) and pulse decomposition of CH4) disclosed that La2O3 reduced the dehydrogenation ability of Ni. CO2-TPO, O2-TPO (followed after CH4TPSR) confirmed that only part amount of carbon species derived from methane decomposition could be removed by CO2, and O2 in feed played a crucial role for the gasification of the inactive surface carbons. Ni/xLa2O3-SiO2 (x = 10, 15, 30) possessed high activity and excellent stability for autothermal reforming of methane in a fluidized-bed reactor.},

	abstract     = {A particle reaction model including mass and heat transfer has been developed to know the temperature variations produced inside the oxygen carrier particles during the cyclic reduction and oxidation reactions taking place in a chemical-looping combustion (CLC) system. The reactions of the different oxygen carriers based on Cu, Co, Fe, Mn, and Ni during the reduction with fuel gas (CH4, CO, and H2) and oxidation (O2) have been considered. In these systems, the oxidation reaction is always exothermic with subsequent heat release; however, the reduction reaction can be exothermic or endothermic depending on the metal oxide and the fuel gas. The heat generated inside the oxygen carriers during the exothermic reactions increases the particle temperature, and could affect the particle structure if the temperature increase is near to the melting point of the active materials. Several variables that affect the reaction rate and the heat transport process have been analyzed to know their effect on the internal particle temperature. For a given oxygen carrier and reaction, the maximum temperature of the particles depended mainly on the particle size, the reaction rate, and the external heat transfer resistance, being lower than the effect of the oxygen carrier porosity, type of inert material, and metal oxide content. The highest temperature variations were reached for the oxidation reactions, with the maximum corresponding to the Ni and Co oxygen carriers with values of ∼ + 90 K for 1 mm particles. The highest temperature increase observed during the reduction reactions corresponded to the reaction of CuO with CO, with values of ∼ + 40 K for 1 mm particles. For the rest of the reactions and metals, the variations in the particle temperature were below 10 K for particle sizes below 1 mm. Under the typical operating conditions that exist in a CLC system, with particle sizes lower than 0.3 mm, 40 wt\% of metal oxide content, and overall conversion times lower than 30 s, the increases of temperature with respect to the bulk conditions were lower than 15 K for any reaction of any oxygen carrier. Moreover, the temperature profiles inside the particles were near flat in most of the practical conditions, and no local points with high temperatures were found. Thus, changes in the solid porous structure of the carrier due to sintering during oxidation in fluidized bed reactors are not expected working at typical temperatures of CLC systems (1000–1300 K).},

	abstract     = {Recent discussions on the fate of LNG spills into impoundments have suggested that the commonly used combination of SOURCE5 and DEGADIS to predict the flammable vapor dispersion distances is not accurate, as it does not account for vapor entrainment by wind. SOURCE5 assumes the vapor layer to grow upward uniformly in the form of a quiescent saturated gas cloud that ultimately spills over impoundment walls. The rate of spillage is then used as the source term for DEGADIS. A more rigorous approach to predict the flammable vapor dispersion distance is to use a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. CFD codes can take into account the physical phenomena that govern the fate of LNG spills into impoundments, such as the mixing between air and the evaporated gas. Before a CFD code can be proposed as an alternate method for the prediction of flammable vapor cloud distances, it has to be validated with proper experimental data.},

CO2 used as tracer was injected into the centre of the bed from a point source. Radial concentration profiles of tracer gas were measured in two planes downstream of the injection point for a broad range of air velocities and solid fluxes, using two sizes of sand panicles of 710 and 380 p,m. A systematic experiment was carried out to find out the main variables acting on the radial gas mixing in the dilute region of a last tluidized bed. An analytical solution derived by Towle and Sherwood for the description of radial gas mixing in turbulent single-phase flow was applied to determine the radial dispersion coefficients, which were found to be dependent on the superficialgas velocity and solid circulating flux. The D\textasciitilde{} values were well correlated with an apparent suspension Reynolds number ( Re ) by an equation of the type D\textasciitilde{} = aRe \textasciitilde '. The proposed equation allows the radial gas coefficient to be predicted as a function of the air velocity and external solid flux present in the riser. This equation, with it.,;corresponding parameters, is applied to the results of other authors and an acceptable fit was found. The high Pe numbers (5(10--2000) obtained in the dilute region of the fast fluidized bed indicate that the flow of the gas in the dilute region approximates to plug flow. \textasciitilde ) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

The energy minimization multi-scale model (Particle-Fluid Two-Phase Flow, the Energy Minimization Multi-Scale Method, Metallurgical Industry Press, Beijing, 1994) is potentially such an approach in which the inclusion of stability criteria enables the prediction of heterogeneity and non-linear behaviors in uidized beds. However, fully analytical solution of the model is impossible so far, and numerical solutions have resorted to general optimizing software. Therefore, the detailed characteristics of the solutions and their theoretical implications have not been fully explored. In this paper, we have achieved this by a rigorous numerical approach and by retrieving all missing roots, which leads to physical mapping of uidization regimes. The model is also extended to unsteady conditions with acceleration and simpliÿed by employing a single stability criterion, which identiÿes choking as a jump between two branches of the stable solution. Calculations based on this version are in reasonable agreement with measurements on bench, pilot and commercial scale circulating uidized beds.},

Cascading simulation approaches on di erent scales, with small-scale approaches provide constitutional correlations to larger scale approaches, is considered a practical way toward this direction. However, by physically reproducing many macro-scale phenomena in uid ow and uidization on micro-scales even below the traditional continuum limit, pseudo-particle modeling (PPM, Ge and Li (Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Circulating Fluidized Bed, Beijing, China, Science Press, Beijing, 1996) has suggested the possibility of a more straightforward and penetrating way. In this paper, traditional approaches are reviewed ÿrst and then PPM is discussed in full length and validated further. We demonstrate that it has maintained all necessities on the molecular level for comprehensive ow description, and the reproduced phenomena, such as bubbling, clustering and radial heterogeneity, have re ected the fundamental mechanism of their macro-scale counterparts despite the vast scale di erence. With this digital miniature, every detail of the ow can be traced non-intrusively until the lowest level in classic physics and experiment with exible parameters, which provides a unique tool for theoretical study and engineering predictions.

In this paper, a detailed derivation of the model is presented together with a clearer demonstration of the convergence and accuracy of the model. The approach is then applied to the problem of plane Poiseuille flow and particle – fluid suspension, resulting in a physically reasonable flow pattern.

The energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model for particle–fluid flow is revisited as an implementation of the analytical multi-scale method to elucidate its principles, in which the correlation between scales is established by analyzing the compromise between dominant mechanisms. This strategy has been extended to six other systems, covering single-phase flow, gas–liquid flow, granular flow and emulsions. A general framework of the method and the common feature of the compromise processes are then presented together with an introduction to some practical applications of the analytical multi-scale method and its extensions.

This phenomenon is of direct relevance to many engineering process operations, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), polyethylene synthesis, and electronic materials coating. In this study, the level-set method and the immersed-boundary method are combined to describe the droplet–particle contact dynamics in a fixed Eulerian grid. The droplet deformation is captured by one level-set function while the solid–fluid boundary condition is imposed on the particle surface through the immersed-boundary method involving another level-set function. A two-dimensional vapour-layer model is developed to simulate the vapour flow dynamics. Equations for the heat transfer characteristics are formulated for each of the solid, liquid and gas phases. The incompressible flow-governing equations are solved using the finite-volume method with the ALE (arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) technique. The simulation results are validated through comparisons with experimental data obtained from the new experimental set-up designed in this study. An important feature of the droplet impacting on a particle with film boiling is that the droplet undergoes a spreading, recoiling and rebounding process, which is reproduced by the numerical simulation based on the model. Details of the collision such as spread factor, contact time and temperature distribution are provided. Simulations are also conducted to examine the effects of the particle size and the collision velocity. Although the value for the maximum spread factor is larger for a higher impact velocity and for a smaller particle, the contact time is independent of the impact velocity and particle size. Both the normal collision and the oblique collision are considered in this study.},

Constructing mathematical model is an effective method for analyzing the performance of the rotary wheel as well as the system. The model can also be used to guide system operation, interpret experimental results and assist in system design and optimization. The overall objective of this paper is to provide a review of various efforts that researchers have made to mathematically model the coupled heat and mass transfer process occurring within the wheel. The paper first briefly describes desiccant wheel including fundamental principle, heat and mass transfer mechanism and the method of model establishment. Then various models consisting of ideal assumptions, governing equations, auxiliary conditions, solution methods and main results are presented. The models can be classified into two main categories: (1) gas-side resistance (GSR) model; (2) gas and solid-side resistance (GSSR) model which can be further subdivided into pseudo-gas-side (PGS) model, gas and solid-side (GSS) model and parabolic concentration profile (PCP) model. It shows that GSSR models are higher in precision and more complex compared with GSR models. In addition, the simplified empirical models based on measured data are briefly discussed. This review is useful for understanding the evolution process and status quo of the mathematical model and highlighting the key aspects of model improvement such as taking account of pressure loss or air leakage.},

The effects of temperature on hydrodynamic cavitating flows are investigated to find the optimum reaction conditions enhancing cavitating treatment intensity. Results show that the cavitation performance, including the cavitation intensity and cavitation unsteady behavior, is influenced by (1) cavitation number σ (the pressure difference affecting the vaporization process), (2) Reynolds number Re (the inertial/viscous ratio affecting the bubble size and liquid–vapor interface area), and (3) thermodynamic parameter Σ (the thermal effect affecting the temperature drop). With increasing temperature, the cavitation length first increases and then decreases, with a cavitation intensity peak at the transition temperature of 58 °C. With the growth of cavitation extent, the cavity-shedding regimes tend to transition from the attached sheet cavity to the periodic cloud cavity, and the vapor volume fluctuating frequency decreases accordingly. A combined suppression parameter (CSP) is provided to predict that, with increasing CSP value, the cavitation intensity can be decreased. Recommendations are given that working under the low-CSP range (55–60 °C) could enhance the intensification of the cavitation process.},

	abstract     = {The injection of an evaporating liquid into reactors plays an important role in chemical engineering. The liquid may be used for agglomeration processes or as educt like for catalytic cracking reactions. Proper mixing and fast evaporation are useful to increase yield and selectivity of the process. Regarding the fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, the injection of a liquid educt inhibits thermal cracking processes (Chen \& Williams (2005)). Investigations have been carried out with FCC-particles as bed material in a pilot-plant scale riser reactor under varying operating conditions. The inner diameter of the circulating fluidized bed is 190 mm and the height of the Riser section is 11.3 m. The specific mass flux was about 200 kg/(m²s) at a temperature of 300°C. The test liquid water was injected in the middle of the riser via full and hollow cone single fluid nozzles, which were set parallel to the uprising stream of hot catalyst particles. The droplet diameter dv90 of the injected water ranged between 269 and 466 µm. The solid distribution and velocity were measured via capacitance probes and the spray zone was characterized by thermocouple probes. Increasing the superficial gas velocity showed strong impact on the development of the radial solid distribution and the spray zone. The radial temperature profile indicates a very small borderline between the spray zone with temperatures below 100°C and the hot environment of the riser flow.},

	abstract     = {We present an Eulerian multiphase approach for modeling the gasification of wood in fluidized beds. The kinetic theory of granular material is used to evaluate constitutive properties of the dispersed solid phase. Comprehensive models for wood pyrolysis, char gasification and homogeneous gas phase reactions are taken into account. The dispersed solid phase within the reactor is modeled as three continuous phases, i.e., one phase representing wood and two char phases with different diameters. In contrast to most other studies we investigate a fluidized bed which consists of wood and char particles without additional inert particles such as limestone or olivine. 2D simulation results for a lab-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor are presented and compared with experimental data for product gas and tar concentrations and temperature. We investigate the influence of two different classes of parameters on product gas concentrations and temperature: (i) operating conditions such as initial bed height, wood feeding rate, and reactor throughput and (ii) model parameters like thermal boundary conditions, primary pyrolysis kinetics, and secondary pyrolysis model. Two different pyrolysis models are implemented and are compared against each other. The numerical results indicate (i) a relatively low influence of the investigated operating conditions on the main product gas components, (ii) a high sensitivity of main product gas components CO and CO2 on the thermal boundary condition, and (iii) a very strong influence of operating conditions and model parameters on the tar content in the product gas.},

We include particle–particle as well as particle–fluid interactions through inelastic collisions and drag forces, in a socalled four-way coupled description. These interactions are the origin for the emergence of coherent particle swarms in a flow. The dynamic cluster-formation and cluster-disintegration are associated with the competition between turbulent dispersion and inelastic particle collisions. We establish the basic scenario of this self-organization and investigate the dominant mean-flow aspects of the resulting turbulence modulation for particles with high Stokes response-time. Large-eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow, using dynamic subgrid models and particles at a significant volume fraction and realistic mass load are presented. These simulations indicate the development of a thinner boundary layer, a flatter velocity profile, an higher effective Von Ka´rma´n constant and an accumulation of particles near the walls. Moreover, it was found that neglecting particle–particle interactions, as done in so-called two-way coupling, leads to a modulated flow which displays a strong ‘center-channel-jet’ that is not found in physical experiments.},

	abstract     = {A numerical modelling approach for the dynamic simulation of solid–liquid fluidized beds is evaluated. This approach is based on an Eulerian two-fluid formulation of the transport equations for mass, momentum and fluctuating kinetic energy. The solid-phase fluctuating motion model is derived in the frame of granular medium kinetic theory accounting for the viscous drag influence of the interstitial liquid phase. Solid–liquid fluidized bed two-dimensional simulations were performed for flow configurations taken from the experimental work of Zenit et al. [1997. Collisional particle pressure measurements in solid–liquid flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 353, 261–283], for three types of solid particles of contrasted inertia in water at high particle Reynolds number (nylon, glass and steel beads). Experimental and numerical granular pressures exhibit a satisfactory agreement with both low and high inertia particles, the best level of prediction being observed with the most inertial particles. Sensitivity of the predictions to the phenomenological laws used in the model is also presented and it appears that, due to non-linear correlations, the average granular pressure in the bed is a less sensitive variable than the fluctuating kinetic energy (or granular temperature). The transport mechanisms of the mean granular temperature in the bed are therefore analyzed as a function of the solid fraction and the particle inertia. At low and moderate Stokes number (nylon and glass beads) and in all range of solid-phase fraction, the dominant production mechanism of fluctuating kinetic energy is due to the mean velocity gradient, whereas the main dissipation term is that induced by the viscous drag. At higher Stokes number (steel beads) and concentration, the production of the granular temperature is controlled by the compressibility effects via the granular pressure. In this case, the dissipation is mainly provided by inter-particle collisions.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents a state of the art measurement and imaging systems used to determine the Gas Void Fraction (GVF) of two-phase flow through annuli. Several research works were conducted for GVF measurement of two and three-phase fluids flowing through full circular pipelines but only few of them targeted the annuli. The highly restricted access and the low volume within which the multiphase fluid flows through in annuli make the instrumentation design challenging. This is especially true if nonintrusive sensors are required to not disturb the flow, which is the case, for instance, if an accurate CFD modeling of annulus flow is sought out of these measurements. Motivated by the numerous industrial applications of annuli, several researchers have suggested various corresponding non-invasive GVF measurement devices to better understand the behavior of the annulus flow and also to determine the production rate. Many of these techniques are based on electrical conductivity measurements using one or several pairs of electrodes. Various configurations of the electrodes were suggested and this paper highlights that none of them can cope with all kinds of flow patterns. Imaging techniques using wire mesh and electrical resistance tomography were also suggested and the initial corresponding results were very encouraging. This paper provides a critical review of each of these techniques and highlights the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of each one. Hence, it can be a valuable research reference for either new scientists in the area of instrumentation to design a sensor targeting annulus flow or to experienced engineers and researchers to keep in touch with the most recent research advances in the area.},

The aspect of layer mixing is also examined by the strength of the expansion or contraction along the flow path, which signifies the effect of curvature upon the extent of mixing. Mixing efficiency as high as 94\% has been achieved for the elliptical type of micromixer. Additionally, the influence of curvature toward the gradual increase and enhancement of mixing has been demonstrated with the gradual increase of the area of contact available in the split and recombine sections.},

At low Reynolds numbers, corresponding to a particle diameter of about 0.2 mm at ambient air conditions, fluid inertial effects can be neglected. At high Reynolds numbers, corresponding to a particle diameter of about 2 mm at ambient air conditions, viscous effects can be neglected. These limits change as the fluid pressure and temperature are varied. By proper adjustment of the length scales, the particle density, and the bed superficial velocity it is possible to obtain exact similitude between geometrically similar beds fluidized by dissimilar fluids.},

	abstract     = {Simplifications to the full set of scaling parameters for dynamic similarity of fluidized beds, Glicksman, Chemical Engineering Science, 39 (1984) 373, were explored. A new set of simplified scaling laws includes the Froude number based on column height, the solid to gas density ratio, the ratio of superficial to minimum fluidization velocity, bed geometric ratios, and particle sphericity and size distribution. When the gas to particle drag is represented by either the Ergun equation or a single particle drag equation, the new simplified laws hold exactly in both the viscous dominated and gas inertia dominated limits. For intermediate conditions, the gas to particle drag is well approximated in models based on the simplified scaling laws. The simplified scaling laws allow very small models to be constructed which properly simulate the hydrodynamics of a full size reactor or combustor. Experimental confirmation of the new simplified scaling laws and the viscous limit scaling parameters, where equality of the density ratio is omitted, were carried out in circulating fluidized beds. Within the viscous limit, the solid to gas density ratio is an important modeling parameter when the slugging regime is approached. In general, the solid to gas density must be matched to achieve good similarity. Using the new simplified scaling laws, good agreement was observed even when the length scale of the air fluidized model was as small as l/16 that of an atmospheric combustor.},

The economics of this process are compared with the direct oxidation of propane to acrylic acid in a fixed bed, turbulent fluidized bed (TFB) and circulating fluidized bed (CFB). Economies of scale are difficult to realize in fixed beds due to the limited heat transfer surface, and therefore, several reactors are required in parallel. A single reactor train is possible due to the excellent heat transfer characteristics of the TFB and CFB. The economics of the TFB are superior to either the CFB or multi-tubular fixed beds. However, both investment and operating costs are sensitive to selectivity. A CFB could become the reactor of choice if lattice oxygen can be shown to improve selectivity and conversion. In order for propane to replace propylene as the preferred feedstock, selectivity must be at least 65 \%, which has yet to be demonstrated in practice.},

The results are compared to the isotropic Maxwellian particle velocity distribution and the impact velocity distribution that constitute the zeroth-order Enskog approximation for the kinetic theory of granular ow. Excellent agreement with the kinetic theory is obtained for elastic particles. The individual particle velocity distribution function is isotropic and Maxwellian. A good ÿt of the collision velocity distribution and frequency is obtained, using the radial distribution function proposed by Carnahan and Starling (J. Chem. Phys. 51 (1969) 635). However, for inelastic and rough particles an anisotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution is obtained. It is concluded that the formation of dense particle clusters disturbs spatial homogeneity and results in collisional anisotropy. Analysis of the impact velocity shows that, in dense gas- uidised beds, not all impact angles are of equal likelihood. The observed anisotropy becomes more pronounced with increasing degree of inelasticity of the particles. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Bubble patterns, time-averaged particle distributions and bed expansion dynamics measured with a nonintrusive digital image analysis technique are compared to simulation results obtained at three different fluidisation velocities. For both CFD models, the simulated flow fields and granular temperature profiles are compared. The effects of grid refinement, particle – wall interaction, long-term particle contacts, particle rotation and gas – particle drag are studied. The mechanical energy balance for the suspended particles is introduced, and the energy household for both CFD models is compared. The most critical comparison between experiments and model results is given by analysis of the bed expansion dynamics. Though both models predict the right fluidisation regime and trends in bubble sizes and bed expansion, the predicted bed expansion dynamics differ significantly from the experimental results. Alternative gas – particle drag models result in significantly different bed dynamics, but the gap between model and experimental results cannot be closed. In comparison with the experimental results, the discrete particle model gives superior resemblance. The main difference between both CFD models is caused by the neglect of particle rotation in the kinetic theory closure equations embedded in the two-fluid model. Energy balance analysis demonstrates that over 80\% of the total energy is dissipated by sliding friction. Introduction of an effective restitution coefficient that incorporates the additional dissipation due to frictional interactions significantly improves the agreement between both models.},

During this process, cavitation bubbles focus fluid energy on the solid surface by forming high-speed jets, leading to damage and downtime of machinery. In response, numerous surface treatments to counteract this effect have been explored, including perfluorinated coatings and surface hardening, but they all succumb to cavitation erosion eventually. Here, we report on biomimetic gas-entrapping microtextured surfaces (GEMS) that robustly entrap air when immersed in water regardless of the wetting nature of the substrate. Crucially, the entrapment of air inside the cavities repels cavitation bubbles away from the surface, thereby preventing cavitation damage. We provide mechanistic insights by treating the system as a potential flow problem of a multi-bubble system. Our findings present a possible avenue for mitigating cavitation erosion through the application of inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials.},

Although direct numerical simulation (DNS) offers the potential to study the physical processes during primary atomization in detail, thereby supplementing experimental diagnostics, it also introduces severe numerical challenges. We outline these challenges and the numerical methods to address them, highlighting some recent efforts in performing detailed simulation of the primary atomization process. The second part is devoted to phenomenological models of primary atomization. Because earlier conventional models of breakup are well reported in the available literature, we highlight only two recent developments: (a) stochastic simulation of the liquid jet depletion in the framework of fragmentation under scaling symmetry and (b) primary atomization in terms of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) mixing with a strong variation of density.},

	abstract     = {The dynamics of cavitation bubbles in the vicinity of a solid cylinder or fibre are seen in water treatment, demolition and/or cleaning of composite materials, as well as bio-medical scenarios such as ultrasound-induced bubbles near the tubular structures in the body. When the bubble collapses near the surface, violent fluid jets may be generated. Understanding whether these jets occur and predicting their directions -- departing or approaching the solid surface -- is crucial for assessing their potential impact on the solid phase. However, the criteria for classifying the onset and directions of the jets created by cavitation near a curved surface of a cylinder have not been established. In this research, we present models to predict the occurrence and directions of the jet in such scenarios. The onset criteria and the direction(s) of the jets are dictated by the bubble stand-off distance and the cylinder diameter. Our models are validated by comprehensive experiments. The results not only predict the jetting behaviour but can serve as guidelines for designing and controlling the jets when a cavitation bubble collapses near a cylinder, whether for protective or destructive purposes.},

The superficial gas velocity was varied from 0.06 to 1.8 m/s and the rate constant from 1 to 9 s -1 . The wide size distribution usually gave the highest reactor efficiency, while the narrow blend gave the lowest. The differences are not solely a function of the '*fines content". The reasons for the influence of particle size distribution were examined by testing the "bimodal" distribution with different fractions active. In the bubbling fluidisatfon regime and for Group A particles, this influence can be predicted using the 'Rro-Phase Bubbling Bed Reactor Model with modifications to allow for increased concentration of fine particles in the dilute phase.},

	abstract     = {Although they account for most of the important applications of gas–solid fluidization, the turbulent fluidization and dense suspension upflow ŽDSU. regimes have received far less attention than less important gas–solid flow regimes like bubbling and fast fluidization. This has arisen for various historical and practical reasons, but it is important that the balance now be redressed. The term turbulent fluidization covers two different types of transitional behaviour for voidages of approximately 0.65 to 0.8, one following a relatively sharp breakdown of bubbling and the other involving intermittency. The DSU regime has only recently been identified as being distinct from turbulent and fast fluidization, even though it has been applied extensively in fluid catalytic cracking for many years. Early approaches to the study and modelling of these two flow regimes tend to be empirical or oversimplified. More promising approaches are now under development based on a statistical probability approach, dissipative structures and computational fluid dynamics ŽCFD.. The difficulties and prospects are discussed in this paper. Such features as turbulence, energy dissipation, intermittency, chaos and computational modelling need to be studied to improve the mechanistic understanding of these flow regimes. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Validation requires objective consideration of computational and numerical error, as well as comparison of model predictions and experimental data over broad ranges of conditions. More care is required in applying these terms, and in planning and conducting experiments to test the validity of fluidized bed numerical codes.

A number of experiments have been carried out both at the upflow and at the downflow of two different circulating fluidized beds containing glass beads of 70 ␮m at superficial gas velocities from 2 to 7 m/s.

A new theoretical model, that is able to predict the pressure losses in the return path of the solid from the standpipe to the riser, has been built. A new correlation for cyclone pressure loss with very high solid loads has been found on the basis of experimental data. The pressure loss in the riser has been calculated by imposing the closure of the pressure balance, P = 0. Once the riser pressure drop had been calculated, the holdup distribution along the riser was obtained by imposing a particular shape of the profile, according to the different fluid-dynamics regimes (fast fluidization or pneumatic transport). In the first case, an exponential decay was imposed and the bottom holdup was adjusted to fit the total pressure drop, in the second case, the height of the dense zone was instead varied.},

	abstract     = {The application of forward light scattering methods for estimating the particle size distribution (PSD) is usually limited by the occurrence of multiple scattering, which affects the angular distribution of light in highly concentrated suspensions, thus resulting in false calculations by the conventionally adopted algorithms. In this paper, a previously proposed neural network-based method is tested with different particle systems, in order to evaluate its applicability. In the first step of the study, experiments were carried out with solid – liquid suspensions having different characteristics of particle shape and size distribution, under varying solid concentrations. The experimental results, consisting of the angular distribution of light intensity, particle shape and suspension concentration, were used as input data in the fitting of neural network models (NN) that replaced the optical model to provide the PSD. The reference values of particle shape and PSD for the NN fitting were based on image analysis. Comparisons between the PSD values computed by the NN model and the reference values indicate that the method can be used in monitoring the PSD of particles with different shapes in highly concentrated suspensions, thus extending the range of application of forward laser diffraction to a number of systems with industrial interest.

The numerical simulation of CFBs is very important in the prediction of its flow behavior. From this point of view, in the present study a dynamic two dimensional model is developed considering the hydrodynamic behavior of CFB. In the modeling, the CFB riser is analyzed in two regions: The bottom zone in turbulent fluidization regime is modeled in detail as two-phase flow which is subdivided into a solid-free bubble phase and a solid-laden emulsion phase. In the upper zone core–annulus solids flow structure is established. Simulation model takes into account the axial and radial distribution of voidage, velocity and pressure drop for gas and solid phase, and solids volume fraction and particle size distribution for solid phase. The model results are compared with and validated against atmospheric cold bed CFB units' experimental data given in the literature for axial and radial distribution of void fraction, solids volume fraction and particle velocity, total pressure drop along the bed height and radial solids flux. Ranges of experimental data used in comparisons are as follows: bed diameter from 0.05–0.418 m, bed height from 5–18 m, mean particle diameter from 67–520 μm, particle density from 1398 to 2620 kg/m3, mass fluxes from 21.3 to 300 kg/m2s and gas superficial velocities from 2.52–9.1 m/s.},

The computational results agreed reasonably well with the experimental data. Moreover, both experimental data and model predictions show that the pressure drop profile is affected by the solid circulation flux and superficial velocity values in the riser. The pressure drop increases along the acceleration region as solid circulation flux increases and superficial velocity decreases.},

The model has been validated against the data from a pilot-scale 50 kW CFB combustor and an industrial-scale 160 MW CFB combustor. A sensitivity analysis is carried out using the model to examine the effect of different operational parameters and coal properties on bed temperature and the overall CO, NOx and SO2 emissions from the combustor. As a result of parametric study, it is observed that by increasing bed operational velocity or excess air ratio, bed temperature decreases and CO emission increases. Bed operational velocity has a more significant effect on CO emission than to bed temperature. Another effect of increasing excess air is the decrease of SO2 and NOx emissions. However, NOx emission increases with the operational bed velocity while SO2 emission decreases.},

The model uses the particle-based approach (PBA) and integrates the hydrodynamics and combustion aspects. The study is also validated with experimental data. As a result of this study, it is observed that the bed-to-wall heat transfer coefficients are strongly dependent on particle diameter and solids concentration at the riser wall. The smaller particles result in higher heat transfer coefficients than larger particles for the same solids volume fraction values. The heat transfer coefficient increases with suspension density. However, at a constant suspension density, the superficial velocity does not have a significant influence on the heat transfer coefficient.

In the bottom zone, a single-phase back-flow cell model is used to represent the solid mixing. Solids exchange, between the bubble phase and emulsion phase is a function of the bubble diameter and varies along the axis of the combustor. In the upper zone, particles move upward in the core and downward in the annulus. Thickness of the annulus varies according to the combustor height. Using the developed simulation program, the effects of operational parameters which are the particle diameter, superficial velocity and air-to-fuel ratio on net solids flux, oxygen and carbon dioxide mole ratios along the bed height and carbon content and bed temperature on the top of the riser are investigated.

Furthermore, solids volume concentration at high-pressure drop of a bubble cap is lower than that at low-pressure drop of a bubble cap at all lateral positions. The pressure drop of the distributor has little influence on the profiles of solids volume concentrations and on the profiles of solids velocities in CFB upper dilute region.

Existing hydrodynamic models fail to properly and reliably describe the flow characteristics typical of CFB catalytic reactors operating at high superficial gas velocities and solids mass fluxes. In the present work, we have compiled an extensive experimental database to encompass published laboratory, pilot, and available industrial scale hydrodynamic data in a concise and useable form. Thorough analysis of the database followed by an in-depth multiple regression analysis yielded a new correlation for calculating the ‘‘slip factor’’, defined as the ratio of the interstitial gas velocity to the particle velocity, to describe Geldart Group A powder systems in the fully developed flow ŽFDF. region of the riser. The correlation allows the evaluation of the gas–solid suspension density in the riser in both the fast fluidization ŽFF. and pneumatic transport ŽPTR. flow regimes. In addition, a comparative study has been carried out on the database to investigate the effects of the geometrical configuration of the top exit of the riser on the suspension density and flow structure. Two reflection coefficient correlations are proposed to account for exit effects for both Groups A and B solids systems. The slip factor and reflection coefficient correlations have been further compared to existing correlations available in the literature for discussion and validation and shown to successfully characterize the large majority of data available in the literature. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

	abstract     = {Evaporation is a unit operation that separates a liquid from solids by means of heat transfer via vaporization or boiling. The purpose of evaporation is to concentrate a solution of a nonvolatile solute (i.e., solids) and a solvent (i.e., liquid), which is typically water. Evaporating a portion of the solvent concentrates the solute into a more-viscous liquid product. Evaporation is regularly used in the food processing, chemical, kraft paper, and pharmaceutical industries to produce liquid concentrates. Evaporation differs from distillation in that the concentrated solution, rather than the condensed evaporate, is typically the valuable product. A common exception is the evaporation of solutions with a high mineral content, where the vapor is condensed as the product and the concentrated brine is discarded. This process is commonly referred to as water distillation, although the process is more akin to a thermally driven Liquid-solids separation operation.},

	abstract     = {Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion systems are increasingly used as superior coal burning systems in power generation due to their higher efficiency and lower emissions. However, because of their non-linearity and complex behavior, it is difficult to build a comprehensive model that incorporates all the system dynamics. In this paper, a mathematical model of the circulating fluidized bed combustion system based on mass and energy conservation equations was successfully extracted. Using these correlations, a state space dynamical model oriented to bed temperature has been obtained based on subspace method. Bed temperature, which influences boiler overall efficiency and the rate of pollutants emission, is one of the most significant parameters in the operation of these types of systems. Having dynamic and parametric uncertainties in the model, a robust control algorithm based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) have been applied to control the bed temperature by input parameters, i.e. coal feed rate and fluidization velocity. The controller proposed properly sets the temperature to our desired range with a minimum tracking error and minimizes the sensitivity of the closed-loop system to disturbances caused by uncertainties such as change in feeding coal, while the settling time of the system is significantly decreased.},

Two particle sizes of 70 and 200 lm are considered in the present work. For the 70 lm particles, the presence of the particles dampens the gas-phase turbulence intensity at the lowest value of Re investigated (8300) compared with the single-phase flow at the same Re. As Re increases, the gas turbulence increases, and for Re {$>$} 13,800 the gas turbulence is enhanced compared with the single-phase flow at the same Re. For the 200 lm particles, the intensity also increases with Re and is enhanced for all values of Re investigated, except at the lowest value of Re investigated (6400). At this value, the gas turbulence is equal to that of single-phase flow at the same Re. The observed trend in the gas-phase turbulence modulation with Re is proposed to be due to the change in the segregation patterns and in the average volume fractions of the particles with increasing Re. More importantly, the present experimental results suggest that, consideration of either the gas and particle characteristic length scales or the particle Reynolds number solely is insufficient to predict gas-phase turbulence modulation in gas–particle flows.},

The effect of the geometrical parameters and the flow parameters on the gas=particle temperature, the convection heat transfer coefficient between the wall and the gas-particle mixture, and the thermal entry length were studied. An increase in particle diameter (loading ratio \% 0.5) extended the thermal entry length and decreased the bulk mixed temperature, particle temperature, and convection heat transfer coefficient. Increasing the pipe diameter led to a significant reduction in bulk mixed temperature and thermal entry length, in addition to a decrease in particle temperature and Nusselt number.

The reactor consists of two regions, i.e., a lower dense region and an upper dilute region. The dynamic two-phase structure was used for modeling the lower dense bed hydrodynamics. The upper region hydrodynamics was modeled by a cluster based approach. This allows the porosity distribution to be calculated for plug flow reactor model assumed for the gas phase in this region. The basic assumption in the cluster based approach is that the solid particles move only as clusters and the amount of single particles in the upper region is negligible. The mathematical model was obtained from coupling the kinetic sub-model, obtained from the literature, with this hydrodynamics sub-model. Comparing the results of the model with the experimental data available in the literature showed close agreement. Two other methods (i.e., particle based approach and short-cut) were also tested in this work. However, it was found that the cluster based approach modeling is quite suitable for the fluidized bed reactor used in this study. The short-cut method seems reasonably applicable for the prediction of the overall conversion but does not provide any local information (such as concentration profiles, yield, etc.) within the fluidized bed reactor.},

Hydrodynamic descriptions for the crucial parts of the unit are incorporated into the model. Special attention has been paid to the reactor riser to predict the velocity distributions of the catalyst and gas phases, the molar concentrations of IO-lump species, and the temperature profile by utilizing momentum, mass, and energy balances. The regenerator is modeled in such detail that the two-regime (dense bed and freeboard), two-phase (emulsion and bubble) behavior of typical fluidized beds can be described. The models for cyclones, valves, and several auxiliary units of the FCC unit are also applied to investigate their dynamic effects on the overall system. The resulting model equations are grouped into 14 modules each of which corresponds to a specific part of the unit and type of equations, and then an efficient iterative scheme is employed for convergence of all the modules. The model solver is constructed on the basis of a modular approach and then implemented by a Fortran code. Finally, to validate the developed simulator, the steady-state simulation results are compared with those in the literature and the dynamic responses of the process are predicted and analyzed. 0 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

First, mathematical modeling was carried out for the reactor, regenerator, main-fractionator, and most of auxiliary units including the feed pre-heater, catalyst cooler, air blower, wet gas compressor, stack gas expander, boilers, and valves. Then, the resulting steady-state model was utilized to develop the model parameter estimator and the process optimizer both of which adopt a successive quadratic programming algorithm to efficiently locate the optimum solutions. The parameter estimator can estimate up to 52 model parameters in order to validate the process model by reducing process–model mismatch. The process optimizer maximizes the economic objective function defined as the difference between the total value of products and the cost of feedstock and utility under 30 operating constraints. The developed optimization system was applied to several optimization cases to maximize the economic profit of the FCC process operated in the full and partial combustion modes and the optimization results were extensively compared and analyzed between the combustion modes. It is expected that the proposed steady-state model, parameter estimation and optimization methods can be utilized to optimize and design modem-type FCC processes under full and partial combustion modes.},

Flow structure and solid flux of dilute phase regime were investigated along both vertical direction and horizontal direction under different boiler loads. Particle-size distribution and carbon content of oil shale combustion residues were obtained. Experimental investigation shows that SO2 concentration decreases with increasing the furnace height, and NOX emission can be reduced by adopting staged combustion technology, low-temperature combustion and circulating combustion. Experimental results are valuable for adjusting the 65 t/h boiler and designing largescale oil shale-fired CFB boiler. At the same time, the experiment lays a foundation for modeling the flow structure, combustion, heat transfer and abrasion of oil shale-fired CFB dilute phase regime.},

	abstract     = {Three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of Circulating Fluidized Beds (CFB's) have been performed. The computations are performed using a 3D multiphase computational fluid dynamics code with an Eulerian description of both gas and particle phases. The turbulent motion of the particulate phase is modeled using the kinetic theory for granular flow, and the gas phase turbulence is modeled using a Sub-Grid-Scale model. A computational study of a cold flowing CFB riser has been performed. The results have been compared to experimental findings of particle volume fraction, particle axial velocity, and pressure drop provided as a blind test in connection with the 10th International Workshop on Two-Phase Flow Prediction held in Merseburg, Germany, 2002. The simulated profiles are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments, but the extend of the radial solid segregation is under predicted in the lower part of the riser. In the upper dilute part of the riser there is good agreement between simulated and measured values both for the solid volume fraction and the pressure profile. A cold flowing riser fluidized with FCC catalysts has been studied. The results were submitted to a blind-test in connection to the 10th international workshop on two-phase flow prediction held in Merseburg, Germany, 2002. The results are validated against experimental findings of particle mass flux across the riser and pressure profile along the riser. The calculations show good agreement with experimental findings of both mass flux and pressure profile, but further improvements are proposed and investigated. A parameter study shows that mesh refinement, choice of particle diameter and choice of drag model are crucial when simulating FCC riser flow. The isothermal decomposition of ozone has been implemented in the CFD code FLOTRACS-MP-3D. The decomposition reaction is studied in a 3D representation of a 0.254 m i.d. riser, which has been studied experimentally by Ouyang et al. (1993). Comparison between measured and simulated time-averaged ozone concentration at different elevations in the riser shows good agreement. The 3D representation of the reactor geometry gives better predictions of the radial variation in concentration than in a similar 2D simulation, Samuelsberg and Hjertager (1995). A parameter study is performed to investigate improvements in the predicted pressure drop profile. When using two-fluid modeling to predict riser flows there have been difficulties in predicting the solids hold up in risers represented by the correct pressure drop profile. Mesh refinement has shown to improve the axial segregation of particles in the riser, but when simulating a riser with a large L/D like an FCC riser in 3D, one is still limited to using rather coarse grids. Another way to get better results would be to use more than one solids phase to represent the actual particle size distribution. The introduction of more particle phases and use of a fine mesh resolution leads to an increase in CPU time. To reduce the wall-clock time for the simulations, the in-house code, FLOTRACS-MP-3D, has been parallelized using domain decomposition. In order to study the influence of mesh resolution and the addition of Eulerian phases, two test cases are investigated. Flow in a lab-scale CFB of the boiler type with a low L/D of 8 and flow in a FCC riser with a larger L/D of 48. For both risers comparison between measured and simulated pressure profile along the riser is performed. For the CFB riser comparisons are made for solids velocities and for the FCC riser measured and simulated solids fluxes are compared. In both cases the simulations compare well to the experiments. For the FCC riser it is concluded that the introduction of more particle phases only give minor improvements in the predictions. For the CFB riser the use of a very fine mesh gives indications of a dense bottom zone that has been almost absent in previous simulations of the case. The simulations have been performed using a parallelized CFD code. It is demonstrated that the number of partitions has no effect in the time averaged results obtained from simulations.},

	abstract     = {Ni/Al2O3 aerogel catalysts were synthesized by a sol–gel method combined with a supercritical drying route. The catalytic performances of the catalysts in methane reforming with CO2 were investigated in a quartz micro-reactor. The results indicated that the aerogel catalyst showed higher specific surface area and higher dispersivity of nickel species than those of impregnation catalyst. The excellent catalytic performances and stabilities were achieved over the aerogel catalysts in the fluidized bed reactor. Comprehensive characterization with TG, XRD and FESEM revealed that the aerogel catalyst in the fluidized bed had much lower carbon deposition than that in the fixed bed. The fluidization of the aerogel catalyst greatly improved the contact efficiency of gas–solid phase, which accelerated the gasification of the deposited carbon. In contrast, the deactivation of the aerogel catalyst was caused by the carbon deposition due to the catalyst without moving in the fixed bed. Moreover, decreasing activity of the impregnation catalyst in the fluidized bed resulted from the poor fluidization state of catalyst particles and low effective active sites on surface of catalyst.},

The meter is a hopper, open at the top and closed at the bottom, with vertical sides containing vertical slots. The hopper is fed continuously from above with granular material which flows out through the slots; because the flow through a slot depends upon the depth of powder upstream of the slot, the inventory of granular material in the hopper is uniquely determined by the flow rate. Hence by mounting the hopper on a load cell to measure the inventory, the flow can be inferred: the cell reading gives a continuous measure of flow rate. Experimental and theoretical work on the flow of granular material through vertical slots is described. Calibration was by an in situ technique based on the dynamic response to change of input flow. This technique was tested against direct calibration (bucket-and-stopwatch) for a pilot-scale unit installed in the particle circulation loop of a fast fluidised bed.},

Viscosity and density of the gaseous medium may significantly vary in applications such as plasma spraying, which can affect the instability waves on the liquid jet column, resulting in a major change in the mechanism of primary and secondary breakups. In this study, a numerical model is used to investigate the impact of gas viscosity on breakup mechanisms for a wide range of density ratios and Weber numbers. Due to many challenges, only a few comprehensive atomization measurements have been performed on this subject. However, novel computational models could provide the atomization process with a thorough picture in the last two decades. The incompressible variable-density Navier–Stokes equations are solved by using finite volume schemes, and a geometric volume-of-fluid technique is used to track the gas–liquid interface. In our parametric study, three sets of density ratios and Weber numbers are chosen. In each set, four cases with different orders of magnitude of gaseous Reynolds number are simulated. Different characteristics of jet atomization are analyzed, such as the jet trajectory, breakup location, and surface instabilities generated along the jet column. Ultimately, the effects of gaseous Reynolds number, density ratio, and Weber number on jet deformation and breakup mechanisms are discussed.},

A new approach to the modelling of solids distribution in the riser is proposed. The approach identifies that the volume-average voidage in a riser is determined by two independent process variables, e.g. the gas velocity and the pressure drop across the riser. It also indicates that the pattern of solids distribution in a riser is related to the mechanism by which the solids are circulated.},

The complete growth and collapse processes during an interaction are successfully reproduced, and interaction regimes of double cavitation bubbles are systematically studied, including strong and weak interactions. The critical distances to distinguish different interaction modes between two equal-sized bubbles are also proposed. For the weak interaction regime of two unequal-sized bubbles, the pressure wave generated by the smaller cavitation bubble leads to less distortion of the larger bubble in the final collapse stage. Moreover, a modified inertia model is proposed, which can be used to predict the liquid film thickness evolution of the unequal-sized bubbles under strong interaction regimes. Unbalanced forces act on the liquid film for two unequal-sized bubbles, making the film more difficult to rupture than for equal-sized bubbles, and the coalescence regime needs a smaller initial distance between them. Finally, the “shield effect” of the outer layer cavitation bubble and the “wall effect” of inner layer cavitation bubbles have been accurately reproduced in a cavitation bubble cluster, and the toroidal bubble shape in the final collapse stage is successfully simulated.},

The model for the interstitial gas phase is based on the Navier–Stokes equations for two-phase flow with fluid turbulence calculated by using LES. Several porosity functions exist in the literature relating the drag force for a particle in a cloud to the drag force on an isolated particle. We have studied the influences of this porosity function, observing large differences in the local flow structure. The fluctuating gas–solid motion has been investigated showing a strong anisotropic flow behaviour, which is similar to experimental findings. The instabilities in these flows are strongly linked to the non-linear drag function due to the group effect of particles in a cloud. The collision parameters have been found to have an important influence on the cluster structures. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

After a discussion of how to define the wall location and roughness height in the most reasonable way, a numerical approach based on the determination of entropy production in rough pipes and channels is presented. As test cases, three different two-dimensional roughness types have been chosen which are representative of regular roughnesses on machined surfaces. In the turbulent range, skin friction results with these test roughnesses can be linked to Nikuradse's sand roughness results by a constant factor. For laminar flows, a significant effect of wall roughness is identified which in most other studies is neglected completely. The dissipation model of this study is validated with experimental data for laminar and turbulent flows.},

CFD simulations are being relied upon to show the performance of the SMX plus both with regard to pressure drop, mixing quality and residence time distribution. These results are confirmed by LIF measurements. The mixing performance for streams with strongly different viscosities is investigated using a decolorization technique.

	abstract     = {Always, oil spills do cause serious and dire consequences for the environment, nature, and society that it consumes much time and socio-economic resources to overcome such consequences. Oil spills, hence, posed a big challenge in searching the advanced technologies and devices to recover spilled oil rapidly and efficiently. Indeed, sorbents have been found to play an extremely critical role in the spilled-oil remediation processes. Recently, a large number of various advanced sorbents and sorbent-based oil-collecting devices/technologies have been developed to enhance the oil-recovery capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to have a comprehensive assessment of the application of sorbent-based oil-collecting devices/technologies in recovering spilled oil. Due to this reason, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the advanced technologies of the combination of sorbents and oil-collecting devices in the oil cleanup strategies. Two main oil-collecting devices such as booms and skimmers that could conjunct with sorbents were critically evaluated on the basis of the applicability and technological features, indicating that the capacity of oil spill recovery could achieve 90\%. Moreover, oil-storage and oil-collecting devices were also completely mentioned. Last but not least, technical directions, concerns over the application of sorbents in oil recovery, and existing challenges relating to storage, transport, and disposal of used sorbents were discussed in detail. In the future, the automatic process of spilled oil recovery with the conjunction between advanced devices and environmentally friendly high-efficiency sorbents should be further investigated to minimize the environmental impacts, reduce the cost, as well as maximize the collected oil spill.},

Measurements were performed over a range of motion encoding times to confirm that the experiments were in the ballistic regime. The results confirm that the granular temperature arises from shear induced by the bubble motion. It was found that the hydrodynamics in the 2D and 3D geometries were significantly different with lower bubble velocities but a higher bubble temperature in the 2D bed than in the 3D bed. The granular temperature was also found to be highly anisotropic, with Tz up to 10 times greater than Tx or Ty.},

J. MulaphaseFlow,21 (1995) 649-.665) for inclined gas-particle stratifiedupflow, it is confirmedthat the pressure gradient of inclined upward transport is consistently greater than that of horizontal transport and a maximum pressure gradient exists corresponding to the critical inclination angle around 65° as the pipelineorientation changes from the horizontalto nearly vertical. Lowering the solids mass flow rate and/or loading ratio leads to a higher critical inclination angle. These findings are in good agreement with the existing experimental results reported in the literature.

We show that dendrite growth could be suppressed, utilizing both the mechanical suppression effect from the polymer framework and the high diffusivity from the aqueous electrolyte.

Our collisionmodel is based on conservation laws for linear and angular momentum and requires, apart from geometrical factors, two empirical parameters: a restitution coefficientand a friction coefficient.A sequenceof collisions is processed using techniques whichfind their application in hard-sphere simulations which are commonly encountered in the field of molecular dynamics.The hydrodynamic model of the gas phase is based on the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Simulations of bubble and slug formation in a small twodimensional bed (height 0.50m, width 0.15m) with 2400 particles (dp = 4 mm, material: aluminium, p = 2700 kg m- 3) showed a strong dependencyof the flowbehaviour with respectto the restitution and friction coefficient.A preliminary experimental validation of our model was performed using a small scale "two-dimensional" gas-fluidisedbed (height 0.30m, width 0.15m, depth 0.015m) with 850/\textasciitilde m ballotini glass particles (p = 2930kgm -3) as the bed material. Results compared fairly well with the results of a simulation which was performedwith 40,000particles using realisticvaluesfor the restitution and friction coefficientswhich were obtained from simple independent experiments.},

The mass ratio of the present sorbent desiccant powder type is from 1.3 to 2.3 times greater than that of silica gel. The sorption rate of the water vapor in the sorbent bed was measured under various conditions. It was found that the sorption rate is highly dependent on the effect of cooling pipes. The sorption ratio increases and the completion time for the sorption process decreases by using multiple cooling pipes.},

Based on careful measurements of flow structure and cluster behavior, it is demonstrated that the turbulent fluidization regime is a transition regime between bubbling and fast fluidization.

With this technique the suspension behavior in an arbitrary cross section can be observed. Furthermore, by applying multiple laser sheets the three-dimensional structure of the suspension can be investigated. In the dilute suspension above a bubbling fluidized bed, the so called “ghost bubbles” were clearly visualized. In the dilute phase transportation regime the existence of clusters was confirmed. The average shape of a cluster was a paraboloid heading downward and enclosing a gas wake in the upper side. From a cluster, particles were shed to the dilute phase continuously and these were again absorbed by other clusters. Cluster sizes and their velocity distributions were determined from the video image analysis. The present data would serve for the future construction of mathematical models on the flow structure of circulating fluidized bed reactors.},

The deposition of heavier particles at the bottom of the pipe wall was found to be higher at lower velocities and lower at higher velocities. The lighter particles were found to remain mostly suspended with homogeneous distribution. Smaller particles also remained suspended with marginal higher concentration near the bottom of the wall.

Analyses of mixing and flow fields have been carried out for a wide range – 0.267–267 – of the Reynolds number. Mixing in the channels has been analyzed by using Navier–Stokes equations with two working fluids, water and ethanol. The results show that the squarewave microchannel yields the best mixing performance, and the curved and the zig-zag microchannels show nearly the same performance for most Reynolds number. For all three cases, the pressure drop has been calculated for channels with equal streamwise lengths. The curved channel exhibits the smallest pressure drop among the microchannels, while the pressure drops in the square-wave and zig-zag channels are approximately the same.},

The wall-bounded turbulent particle-laden flows in which the experimental data are available are chosen as the test problems for demonstration. Results obtained with the deterministic method accounting for interparticle collisions are used as a basis for validating the proposed stochastic Lagrangian model. Good agreement between the predictions obtained separately with the deterministic and DSMC methods is achieved. The benefit of saving computational expenditure when using the DSMC method becomes more remarkable than the deterministic method as the number of particles loaded in the flow is increased. In addition, the study demonstrates that τP/τC is a proper parameter to monitor the role of inter-particle collisions in the physical processes of particle-laden flows.},

Effective adsorptive purification of a low concentration of propylene from quinary PDH byproducts comprising methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), propylene (C3H6), and propane (C3H8) has been an unsolved academic bottleneck. Herein, we now report an ultramicroporous zinc metal−organic framework (Zn-MOF, termed as 1) underlying a rigid one-dimensional channel, enabling trace C3H6 capture and effective separation from quinary PDH byproducts. Adsorption isotherms of 1 suggest a record-high C3H6 uptake of 34.0/92.4 cm3 cm−3 (0.01/0.1 bar) at 298 K. In situ spectroscopies, crystallographic experiments, and modeling have jointly elucidated that the outstanding propylene uptakes at lower pressure are dominated by multiple binding interactions and swift diffusion behavior, yielding quasi-orthogonal configuration of propylene in adaptive channels. Breakthrough tests demonstrate that 30.8 L of propylene with a serviceable purity of 95.0−99.4\% can be accomplished from equimolar C3H6/C3H8 mixtures for 1 kg of activated 1. Such an excellent property is also validated by the breakthrough tests of quinary mixtures containing CH4/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8 (3/5/6/ 42/44, v/v/v/v/v). Particularly, structurally stable 1 can be easily synthesized on the kilogram scale using cheap materials (only \$167 for per kilogram of 1), which is important in industrial applications.},

Against this backdrop, this work aims to gain some understanding of how thermolysis affects the manner in which a heavy Arabian vacuum resid droplet vaporizes in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Specifically, we study the vaporization history of the droplet under two limiting conditions that bracket the actual vaporization process. One is a high-temperature environment in which the catalyst heats up only the resid droplet. Another is a low-temperature environment in which the catalyst vaporizes a gas oil before heating the resid droplet. Key findings are as follows: (1) Droplet life can go through one, two, or three stages, depending on the drop size and environment. A large droplet in the high-temperature environment goes through the heat-up, thermolysis and evaporation stages. A small droplet at low temperatures goes through only the heat-up stage. (2) The effect of thermolysis increases with temperature and the initial drop size. (3) Thermolysis can significantly lower the drop’s steady-state temperature—the larger the drop, the greater the effect and, hence, the longer the drop lifetime and (4). During the evaporation stage, the drop’s surface area decrease can be approximated by the classical D2-law.},

A more feasible method is proposed to determine the acceleration length from the measured axial profiles of pressure gradient (or apparent solids holdup). With this new method and large amounts of experimental results, a clear picture of the variation of the acceleration length with both solids circulating rate and superficial gas velocity is obtained. It is found that the acceleration length increases generally with increasing solids flow rate and/or decreasing gas velocity. However, the particular variation patterns of the acceleration length with operating conditions are quite different in different operation ranges. Especially under the conditions near or at the accumulative choking, the acceleration length extends rapidly with increasing solids flow rate and/or decreasing gas velocity, and sometimes takes up the whole riser height. Reasonable explanations are provided for the observed variation patterns of the acceleration length.},

	abstract     = {Optimization and control of CFB is very important and requires an accurate, real time, dynamic model to describe and quantify the process. The present work focuses on modeling the transient behavior of large CFB units, whose flow characteristics were shown to yield C-shaped voidage profiles using cork as the fluidizing material and air at ambient conditions. The riser is modeled in two ways: 1) as a set of well-mixed tanks connected in series; 2) as a 1-D axisymetric cluster flow. The tanks-in-series model visualizes the riser as consisting of a series of well-mixed vessels. When the gas flow rate is constant and solids flow rate changes as a sine wave function, the voidages along the riser indicate a family of sine waves with significant phase shifts. Using this method, the dynamic response time at different locations along the riser was estimated successfully. The cluster flow model assumes that gas and solids flows are unidirectional with no mixing in the axial direction, and the solids move upward in the riser as clusters. This model can be used to predict the smooth changes in voidage profiles for transient processes.},

The particle flow is firstly developed from center, and then towards the wall. The riser height is an important factor for the design of circulating fluidized bed reactors. Increasing the solid circulating rate significantly slows down the flow development process, while increases in the superficial gas velocity accelerate it.},

	abstract     = {The development of the cross-sectional distribution of the concentration of fine powders in dilute phase pneumatic conveying through different pipe elements was examined in detail in order to characterize the degree of segregation. The pipe system considered involved horizontal and vertical pipes connected by pipe bends of different bend radii. Additionally, it was possible to change the configuration into a combination of horizontal pipe, pipe bend, and horizontal pipe. Measurements were performed using smooth glass pipes and stainless steel pipes with a known degree of roughness. The average conveying velocity was varied between 10 and 30 m/s, and particle mass loadings between 0.2 and 1.0 (kg dust/kg air) were considered. The particles used in the study were spherical glass beads with a number mean diameter of 40 pm. The laser-light sheet method combined with digital image processing was applied to characterize the degree of non-uniformity of the particle concentration distribution in the different pipe elements. With the light sheet intersecting the pipe cross-section at an angle of about 45”, it was possible to obtain an entire field picture of the intensity of the light scattered by the particles. Using a simplified theory, the power of the scattered light could be related to the particle concentration distribution in the cross-section of different pipe elements (e.g. horizontal and vertical pipes). Additionally, information on the particle velocity and the spatial development of the particle size distribution were obtained by phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) which allowed single point measurements along a line through the pipe cross-section. Moreover, accurate particle concentration measurements were performed by PDA with a recently developed method. The results revealed the influence of the different flow conditions, i.e. conveying velocity and particle mass loading, on the cross-sectional distribution of the particle concentration in different pipe elements. It was furthermore found that the wall roughness has a considerable influence on the development of the particle concentration distribution.},

Predicted instantaneous solids concentration frequencies compared well with the experimental data for various regions of the riser. Computed total granular temperature distributions in the riser qualitatively agree with experimental data. High thermal conductivities of fluidized powders (about 50 times that of the fluidizing gas) were estimated from the kinetic theory without adjusted parameters. Effects of initial conditions, inlet geometry, riser diameter and riser vertical inclination were assessed. Unexpected strong distortions of solids concentrations and vertical fluxes were predicted for small inclination angles of the order of 2◦. Analysis of experimental data should, therefore, be carefully conducted to ensure that riser inclination is not too important over the length of the riser in order to eliminate potential artifacts due to this geometric parameter.},

The multi-fluid model with gas phase and two particle phases of either different particle sizes or densities is used to simulate flows in bubbling gas-solids fluidized beds. The flow behavior of particle mixing or separation in bubbling fluidized beds was numerically predicted. Details of particle collision information were obtained through tracing particle motions based on Eulerian-Largarian approach coupled with the discrete hard-sphere t model. The distributions of volume fraction, velocity and granular temperature of particles of two different ip sizes or densities were obtained. The discrete hard-sphere modeling results quantified the granular r temperatures, particle fluctuating velocities, particle phase stresses, as well as the particle shear viscosities. sc The simulations using both the multi-fluid model and the discrete hard-sphere model clearly indicate u particle separation phenomenon in the fluidized beds, where relatively larger or heavier particles are n observed near the bed bottom than at the bed top region while relatively smaller or lighter particles were a found at bed top than at the bed bottom. Better particle mixing can be obtained by increasing the fluidizing m velocity.},

Three different COD/N ratios of 10:1, 6:1 and 4:1 were tested at an empty bed contact time of 0.82 h. More than 90\% of the influent organic matter was removed throughout the study with 58\% removal in the anoxic column in Phase III. Total nitrogen removal efficiencies in Phases I–III were 91\%, 82\% and 71\% and simultaneous nitrification–denitrification (SND) occurred in the aerobic downer. The LSCFB demonstrated tertiary effluent quality at COD/N ratio of 10:1 and 6:1 with soluble biochemical oxygen demand (SBOD) {$<$}10 mg lÀ1 and total nitrogen (TN) {$<$}10 mg lÀ1.},

The air velocity and solids circulation \#ux had only a small in\#uence on the solids hold-up once high-density conditions were attained. At these high-density conditions, re\#uxing of solids near the riser wall, commonly observed in low-density CFB risers, disappeared and was replaced by a more homogeneous \#ow structure. The slip velocity increased with solids hold-up and, for constant super"cial gas velocity, there appears to be a unique relationship between the two. Slip factors as high as 10 were obtained in the developed region of the riser, compared to values of about 2 to 5 reported in the literature for more dilute fully developed \#ows in the fast \#uidization \#ow regime. Di!erential pressure \#uctuations increased with increasing suspension density and were not signi"cantly a!ected by super"cial gas velocity and height.

High-density flow of cross-sectional mean volumetric solids concentration of about 0.2 " 0.05 was achieved in the riser with fluid catalytic cracking ŽFCC. particles of mean diameter 70 mm and density 1600 kgrm3. Local time-mean voidages were nearly as low as ´mf at the wall and as high as 0.9 at the axis. As in our other recent work, solids refluxing near the wall of dilute CFB risers no longer existed for high-density conditions. Statistical analysis of local voidage fluctuations was used to characterize the local flow dynamics. The core behaves as a relatively uniform dilute flow, interspersed with infrequent particle structures. The number and density of these structures increases with radius. Maximum heterogeneity for high-density conditions occurs at some distance from the wall, unlike dilute risers where the flow is least uniform at the wall. Intermittency index vs. local voidage plots are ‘‘bell-shaped’’, with a maximum where the local time-mean voidage is approximately 0.75. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

The fluidized-bed combustion development has reached a crucial phase which can be characterized by the following key points: (1)Technical problems could be solved by exchange of experience. (2)The electricity and heat requirement is stagnating in some industrialised countries. (3)The requirement of an additional flue gas cleaning system may offset an essential FBC advantage. (4)Economic comparison between FBC and pulverized fuel firing systems show advantages for the former in most cases. (5)Utilization of combustion residues is still regarded as a negative decision criterium in many cases even if significant progress could be achieved. (6)The state-of-the-art unit size is some 800 MWth. In future more power plants within the medium size of 200–500MWe will be needed. (7)Further development will yield economically sound coal based combined cycle power plant variants with maximum efficiency.

Just consider how sand can stream through the orifice of an hourglass  yet support one's weight on the beach; how it can form patterns  strikingly similar to a liquid when vibrated, yet respond to stirring  by “unmixing” of large and small grains. Despite much effort,  there still is no comprehensive understanding of other forms of matter,  like ordinary fluids or solids. In what way, therefore, is granular  matter special, and what makes it so difficult to understand? An  emerging interdisciplinary approach to answering these questions  focuses directly on the material's discontinuous granular nature.},

Their design can be supported by interface-resolving numerical simulations, requiring accurate methods and validated computer codes. Especially challenging are submillimetre air bubbles in water due to their large density contrast and dominance of surface tension. Here, we evaluate two numerical methods implemented in OpenFOAM⃝R , namely the standard solver interFoam with an algebraic volume-of-fluid method relying on a sharp interface representation and phaseFieldFoam relying on the phase-field method with diffuse interface representation. For a circular bubble in static equilibrium, we explore the impacts of uniform grid resolution and bubble size on bubble shape, mass conservation, pressure jump and spurious currents. While the standard interFoam solver exhibits excellent mass conservation with errors below 0.1\% on fine grids, it lacks the accuracy to predict reasonable physics for a bubble in microfluidic systems. At higher resolution, large spurious currents significantly displace and deform the bubble, which is oscillating with resolution dependent mode and frequency. Furthermore, the pressure jump is consistently underestimated by more than 10\%. The solver phaseFieldFoam suffers from much larger mass losses of up to 2\%, which decrease as the ratio between interface thickness and bubble diameter decreases provided the diffuse interface region is adequately resolved. Spurious currents are very low and the bubble remains circular preserving its initial position with an error in pressure jump below 1\%.},

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

It permits a characterization of the initial states for which the Boltzmann H theorem is violated. In particular, it is shown that: (a) Any monatomic system for which the equilibrium potential energy exceeds the minimum possible value possesses a continuum of initial states for which the approach to equilibrium takes place through an increase, rather than a decrease, in Boltzmann's H. (b) If the initial distribution of particles is spatially homogeneous and Maxwellian, the approach to equilibrium will take place through an increase (decrease) in the Boltzmann H, according as the initial potential energy is less (greater) than the equilibrium value. (c) A necessary condition for the H-theorem-violating phenomenon is that the approach to equilibrium takes place through a conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy; a sufficient condition requires also that the initial velocity distribution be sufficiently close to Maxwellian. (d) These H-theorem-violating conditions are readily attained experimentally; for example, the free expansion of oxygen gas at 160 °K and 45-atm pressure produces an experimentally realizable violation of the Boltzmann H theorem.},

	abstract     = {The fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) has a major effect on profitability of an oil refinery. The FCCU is difficult to model well, due to significant nonlinearities and interactions. Control of the FCC is challenging and there is strong incentive to use multivariable (MV) control schemes, such as model predictive control (MPC), which accommodate these interactions. The linear MV schemes rely on linearized model around an operating point and therefore, it is difficult to obtain high quality control. This paper uses a singular value decomposition method (N4SID) to obtain a state space model which is then reduced to a step model required by the MPC algorithm. Simulations on a detailed model [Chem.

The relationship between the electrode microstructure and battery performance is studied in detail by developing a two-dimensional (2D) lattice Boltzmann model to reveal the ion and electron transport within an LIB porous electrode. The present model is established by using randomly reconstructed electrode geometry and the coupling of the electrochemical reaction and ion and electron transport under complex boundary conditions. The influences of the micro-scale morphological features of the battery electrode on the local lithium concentration distribution, electric potential and macroscopic discharge performance are revealed. The randomness of the particle distribution and particle shape result in a heterogeneous distribution of the lithium concentration and electrode potential. In electrode particles, lithium exchanges are enhanced for small particles and improved at the edges and corners for large irregular particles. Regions with low lithium concentration produce a high electric potential. A large particle size and low porosity in an anode improve battery performance. Likewise, a small particle size and high porosity in a cathode also improve battery performance.},

The study investigates the impact of mode numbers and design points. The results show that the use of the ROM can result in a reduction of computation time of up to three orders of magnitude with reasonable accuracy.

The pressure and speed fluctuations of the valve in the throttle section were greater than those at other locations. By calculating the entropy production rate, the reason and location of valve energy loss are analyzed. The energy loss near the throttling section accounts for about 92.7\% of the total energy loss. According to the calculated energy loss relationship between different regions of the spool angle, the relationship between any spool angle and energy loss in the [80,120] interval is proposed.

The computed energy spectrum captures the observed gravity wave and the Kolmogorov −5/3 law at high frequencies. The computed turbulent kinetic energy is close to the measurements for FCC particles. The CFD simulations compared reasonably well with the measured core-annular flow experiments at very high solid fluxes. The computed granular temperatures, solids pressures, FCC viscosities and frequencies of oscillations were close to measurements reported in the literature. The computations suggest that unlike for the flow of group B particles, the oscillations for the FCC particles in the center of the riser are primarily due to the oscillations of clusters and not due to oscillations of individual particles.

	abstract     = {In chemical-looping combustion (CLC) a gaseous fuel is burnt with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The oxygen is transported from the combustion air to the fuel by means of metal oxide particles acting as oxygen carriers. A CLC system can be designed similar to a circulating fluidized bed, but with the addition of a bubbling fluidized bed on the return side. Thus, the system consists of a riser (fast fluidized bed) acting as the air reactor. This is connected to a cyclone, where the particles and the gas from the air reactor are separated. The particles fall down into a second fluidized bed, the fuel reactor, and are via a fluidized pot-seal transported back into the riser. The gas leaving the air reactor consists of nitrogen and unreacted oxygen, while the reaction products, carbon dioxide and water, come out from the fuel reactor. The water can easily be condensed and removed, and the remaining carbon dioxide can be liquefied for subsequent sequestration. The gas leakage between the reactors must be minimized to prevent the carbon dioxide from being diluted with nitrogen, or to prevent carbon dioxide from leaking to the air reactor decreasing the efficiency of carbon dioxide capture. In this system, the possible gas leakages are: (i) from the fuel reactor to the cyclone and to the pot-seal, (ii) from the cyclone down to the fuel reactor, (iii) from the pot-seal to the fuel reactor. These gas leakages were investigated in a scaled cold model. A typical leakage from the fuel reactor was 2\%, i.e. a CO2 capture efficiency of 98\%. No leakage was detected from the cyclone to the fuel reactor. Thus, all product gas from the air reactor leaves the system from the cyclone. A typical leakage from the pot-seal into the fuel reactor was 6\%, which corresponds to 0.3\% of the total air added to the system, and would give a dilution of the CO2 produced by approximately 6\% air. However, this gas leakage can be avoided by using steam, instead of air, to fluidize the whole, or part of, the pot-seal. The disadvantages of diluting the CO2 are likely to motivate the use of steam. D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The numerical results are compared to experiments by means of power spectral density distributions of fluctuating pressure signals and bubble statistics obtained from capacitance probe measurements. Two different particle rheology models are tested in combination with two different values of the maximum particle volume fraction. The first particle model predicts the particle pressure by an exponential power law and assumes a constant particle viscosity (CPV), and the second model predicts the stresses using the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). Furthermore, two model approaches for the air inflow are evaluated. The first inflow model includes the coupling between the air-feed system and the fluidized bed in the simulation, and the second model assumes a constant mass flow of gas into the fluidized bed. Finally, the influence of the compressibility of the gas phase on the numerical predictions is investigated. The numerical simulations are made using the CFX-4.4 commercial flow solver.},

A continuously operated laboratory reactor system for chemical-looping combustion with two interconnected fluidized beds was designed and built. This chemical-looping combustor was designed to operate with a fuel flow corresponding to 100–300 W. The CLC system was operated successfully using a highly reactive nickel-based oxygen-carrier. Furthermore, tests were carried out to determine the degree of gas leakage between the reactors. Although there was some leakage between the fuel and air reactors, it is low enough to enable evaluation of the combustion results. The combustion tests showed a high conversion of the natural gas to carbon dioxide, indicating that the particles are suitable for chemical-looping combustion. No methane was detected in the gas from the fuel reactor, and the fraction of carbon monoxide was in the range 0.5–3\%.},

	abstract     = {This work compares time, frequency and state-space analyses of pressure measurements from fluidized beds. The experiments were carried out in a circulating fluidized bed, operated under ambient conditions and under different fluidization regimes. Interpretation of results in time domain, such as standard deviation of the pressure fluctuations, may lead to erroneous conclusions about the flow regime. The results from the frequency domain (power spectra) and state-space analyses (correlation dimension, DML, and Kolmogorov entropy, KML, together with a non-linearity test) of the pressure fluctuations are generally in agreement and can be used complementary to each other. The power spectra can be divided into three regions, a region corresponding to the macro-structure (due to the bubble flow) and, at higher frequencies, two regions representing finer structures that are not predominantly governed by the macro structure of the flow. In all fluidization regimes, the measured pressure fluctuations exhibited an intermittent structure, which is not revealed by power spectral analysis of the original signals. Fluctuations with pronounced peaks in the power spectrum and in the auto-correlation function, corresponding to passage of single bubbles through the bed, are non-linear with a low dimension (DML{$<$}5.5). For DML{$<$}5.5, the Kolmogorov entropy is proportional to the amount of energy in the spectral range of the intermittent structures observed, whereas for DML{$>$}5.5 both KML (bits/cycle) and DML are insensitive to changes in the distribution of energy in power spectra. Thus, the state-space analysis reflects that non-linearity is mostly found in the macro-structure of the flow.

Alumina supported Rh and Pd catalysts proved to be especially suitable for this task. The rhodium catalysts enabled efficient aromatics hydrogenation in the temperature range of 120 °C to 150 °C with moderate methane formation (CH4/CO2{$<$}0.1 at 150 °C). The palladium catalyst showed the lowest selectivity to methane formation (CH4/CO2{$<$}0.1 at 270 °C) and promising hydrogenation activity at temperatures above 200 °C even in the presence of CO and CO2.},

The process is composed of two interconnected fluidized bed reactors. The air reactor which is a conventional circulating fluidized bed and the fuel reactor which is a bubbling fluidized bed. The basic principle is to avoid the direct contact of air and fuel during the combustion by introducing a highly-reactive metal particle, referred to as oxygen carrier, to transport oxygen from the air to the fuel. In the process, the products from combustion are kept separated from the rest of the flue gases namely nitrogen and excess oxygen. This process eliminates the energy intensive step to separate the CO2 from nitrogen-rich flue gas that reduce the thermal efficiency.},

A conservative finite difference method of purely 2nd- and mixed 4th/2nd-order is applied. The explicit 4th-order, six-stage lowstorage Runge–Kutta method is used for time advancement.

The purpose of this paper is to show how the threshold velocities can be used to design of particle--fluid systems for particle size distribution. The analysis provides practical guides for various engineering scenarios, such as selecting the appropriate fluidization velocity for maximum fluidization and minimum entrainment and determining the conveying velocity in pneumatic systems. In addition, the analysis provides a guide to determine whether the deposited layer of particles at the pipe bottom is stationary or moving, for cases where the superficial velocity is smaller than the saltation velocity.},

The model is verified and validated on multiple cores with different test cases, ranging from impinging particle streams to laboratory-scale bubble columns. The parallel performance is shown using two different large scale systems: with an uniform and a non-uniform distribution of bubbles.

Low-temperature plasmas are often used for surface processes like cleaning, activating or coating. A circulating fluidised bed (CFB) for plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) on powders is introduced here. A low-temperature plasma is generated in a riser tube by coupling microwaves. As a model application, NaCl crystals were coated with a thin silicon oxide film and the deposition rate was measured. Since a similar treatment time for each particle is crucial for a homogeneous coating, the residence time distribution (RTD) in the reactor is estimated. It is shown that the process temperature can be easily adjusted to very low values. The data presented allows the design of industrial plasma processes on powders with similar electromagnetic properties. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

In recent years, use of inexpensive and abundantly available biosorbents generated from fibrous plant-based food-waste materials to remove heavy metals has garnered considerable research attention. The aim of this review is to investigate the applicability of using fibrous plant-based food waste, which comprises different components such as pectin, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, to remove heavy metals from wastewater. This contribution confirms that plant-fiber-based food waste has the potential to bind heavy metals from wastewater and aqueous solutions. The binding capacities of these biosorbents vary depending on the source, chemical structure, type of metal, modification technology applied, and process conditions used to improve functionalities. This review concludes with a discussion of arguments and prospects, as well as future research directions, to support valorization of fibrous plant-based food waste as an efficient and promising strategy for water purification.},

In the case of partial heat penetration, the heat flux applied to the wall side of the clusters has not reached its bed-side, while in the case of total heat penetration the heat flux has completely crossed the cluster, and the temperature of its bed-side would differ from the bed temperature. Based on the heat balance equation inside the cluster, two different expressions were derived for heat transfer coefficient for each penetration period.

These two approaches are supplemented with appropriate closure equations that take into account all the pertinent forces and interaction effects on the solid particles, such as: particleturbulence interactions; turbulence modulation; particle-particle interactions; particle-wall interactions; gravitation, drag and lift forces. The two methods have been used in order to simulate the turbulent particulate flow in upward pipes. The flow domain in all cases was a cylindrical pipe and the computations were carried for upward pipe flow. Monodisperse as well as polydisperse mixtures of particles have been considered. In general, the average velocity results obtained from the two methods are in close agreement, because the methods predict well the average velocity distribution of the carrier fluid as well as the solids. Thus, the differences in the average axial velocities predicted by the methods are not substantial. Differences in the turbulence intensity are more significant. A comparison of the numerical results obtained shows the relative importance of retaining the diffusion terms in both the axial and radial directions in the RANS method. Also the comparisons of the results show the relative effect of the lift forces in the distribution of solid particles.},

In these experiments, a light diode assembly was utilized to infer the local solids volume fractions within a rectangular bed of 10 nm silica particles. These experimental measurements yielded a two dimensional solids volume fraction distribution within the rectangular bed. The experimental results provided some new insights into the distribution of solids within the bed. The agglomerate diameters were computed using a momentum balance with the drag given by the Ergun equation and the empirical Richardson–Zaki method. Both methods yielded agglomerate diameters of the order of 100 μm and showed dependence on the strength of the electric field.

When gas flow is more than the minimum fluidization velocity, the top of the fluidized bed may fluctuate vigorously leading to unstable operation. Bed fluctuation and fluidization quality are interrelated. The quality of fluidization can largely be improved by introducing baffles in bubbling and turbulent fluidized beds. In the present work three baffle geometries, i.e., circular, triangular and square are used to determine different hydrodynamic parameters such as minimum fluidization velocity, bed expansion, pressure drop across the bed, fluctuation ratio, expansion ratio, etc. in a bubbling fluidized bed. A new parameter blockage ratio is introduced to analyze the behaviour of baffled fluidized beds. It is found from the current experimental studies that the blockage ratio mainly influences the hydrodynamics of the bed rather than the shape of the baffle.},

	abstract     = {Enhancing the efficiency of industrial water electrolysis for hydrogen production is important for the energy transition. In electrolysis, hydrogen is produced at the cathode, which forms bubbles due to the diffusion of dissolved hydrogen in the surrounding supersaturated electrolyte. Hydrogen (and oxygen) bubbles play an important role in the achievable electrolysis efficiency. The growth of the bubbles is determined by diffusive and convective mass transfer. In turn, the presence and the growth of the hydrogen bubbles affect the electrolysis process at the cathode. In the present study, we simulate the growth of a single hydrogen bubble attached to a vertical cathode in a 30 wt\% KOH solution in a cathodic compartment represented by a narrow channel. We solve the Navier–Stokes equations, mass transport equations and potential equation for a tertiary current distribution. A sharp interface immersed boundary method with an artificial compressibility method for the pressure is employed. To verify the numerical accuracy of the method, we performed a grid refinement study and checked the global momentum and hydrogen mass balances. We investigate the effects of flow rate and operation pressure upon bubble growth behaviour, species concentrations, potential and current density. We compare different cases in two ways: for the same time and for the same bubble radius. We observe that increasing the flow velocity leads to a small increase in efficiency. Increasing the operation pressure causes higher hydrogen density which slows down the bubble growth. For a given bubble radius, increasing the pressure leads to a small decrease in efficiency.},

Strong top to bottom liquid circulation is also promoted by baffling, however; this circulation rapidly brings particles back to the surface. In this paper, two alternate baffle configurations are proposed: half baffles and surface baffles. The objective is to maintain a high level of turbulence at the surface while reducing the return circulation from the bottom of the tank. The performance of the baffle configurations is compared using the just drawn down speed, Njd, and cloud depth, CD, for the PBTD, PBTU and A340 impellers. CFD simulations and measurements of the power number for the fully baffled and the surface baffled configurations are also reported. It is found that half baffles are very similar to full baffles in performance, but surface baffles offer several advantages: a significant reduction in Njd, more robust performance at large submergences, and a better distribution of solids.},

A momentum probe was used to measure radial profiles of solids momentum flux at several heights and to distinguish between local net upward and downward flow. In the experimental range covered (Ug = 5.8 m/s; Gs = 22.345 kg/m2 s), the fast fluidization flow regime was observed to coexist with dense suspension upflow (DSU). At a constant gas velocity, net downflow of solids near the wall disappeared towards the bottom of the riser with increasing solids mass flux, with dense suspension upflow achieved where there was no refluxing of solids near the riser wall on a time-average basis. The transition to DSU conditions could be distinguished by means of variations of net solids flow direction at the wall, annulus thickness approaching zero and flattening of the solids holdup versus Gs trend. A new flow regime map is proposed distinguishing the fast fluidization, DSU and dilute pneumatic transport flow regimes. ᭧ 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Time – mean dynamic pressure (DPm) decreases towards the wall in the range Ug=5 – 8 m/s, Gs=10 – 340 kg/m2 s. The thickness of the annular downflow layer based on DPm=0 reaches a maximum with increasing height. The annular downflow layer disappears locally with increasing solids mass flux ( Gs) at a constant gas velocity, with achievement of the dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime. A new correlation is developed to predict the time – mean thickness of solids down-flowing layer based on solids mass flux and momentum flux. It successfully accounts for the variation of the annular layer thickness with height and Gs, and covers a wide Gs range right up to near the onset of the DSU regime.},

The wake behind a particle, a particle size, the loading ratio and the density difference between two phases of a particle-laden flow were considered as significant parameters, which have an influence on the turbulence of a particle-laden flow, and the relative velocity of the laden particles was calculated by using a terminal velocity. The frictional pressure drop was formulated by using the force balance in the control volume by considering the shear stresses due to the presence of particles and an analogy of the shear stresses in the solid surfaces. The numerical results show a good agreement with the available experimental data and the model successfully predicted the mechanism of the pressure drop in the particle-laden flows.},

	abstract     = {Influences of configurations of solids feeding device and riser exit on the flow behaviors of gas–solid in a solids circulation system were studied in order to investigate a highly dense solids circulation at high velocity. Experiments were carried out in a lab-scale circulating fluidized bed (0.05 mID × 4.5 m-H) cold model with FCC particles (dp = 70 μm, ρs = 1740 kg/m3) as a bed material. Three kinds of solids feeders (Loop-seal, J-valve and Lvalve type) and three different shapes of riser exits (C, L and T-shape) were employed. It was found that the solids mass flux (Gs) increased with increasing the primary gas velocity (U1) in all configurations, and the level of Gs with the L-valve was much higher than the other feeders and the high Gs enabled solids holdup (εs) in the riser to be relatively dense at high U1. Among the three riser exit configurations investigated (C, L and T-shape), on the other hand, C-shape exit provided high Gs and εs at high U1. In this study, a highly dense solids circulation was observed under conditions such as LV solids feeder and C-shape riser exit with sufficient solids inventory (Is). The effects of the inlet and exit configurations on the gas–solid flow behaviors from a dilute to a dense-phase were discussed based on correlation dimension (Dc) and Kolmogorov entropy (K) obtained by chaos analysis of pressure fluctuations.},

A geometry-grid template toolkit is developed to address the need to produce a large number of grids in a timely manner for the parametric design study. An objectoriented optimization toolkit that allows a flexible and extensible interfacing with user-specific codes is used. An in-house full Navier–Stokes flow solver is developed and used in the framework. Code integration is achieved using a black-box interface with script files.

Written with the practicing control engineer in mind, the book:  Brings together proven design methods, many of which have never been published before Focuses on techniques that have an immediate practical application Minimizes the use of daunting mathematics – but for the more demanding reader, complex mathematical derivations are included at the end of each chapter  Covers the use of all the algorithms, common to most distributed control systems  This book raises the standard of what might be expected of even basic controls. In addition to the design methods it describes any shortcuts that can be taken and how to avoid common pitfalls. Proper application will result in significant improvements to process performance.

However, despite the flexibility and widespread use of distillation processes, they still remain extremely energy inefficient. Increased optimization and novel distillation concepts can deliver substantial benefits, not just in terms of significantly lower energy use, but also in reducing capital investment and improving eco-efficiency. While likely to remain the separation technology of choice for the next few decades, there is no doubt that distillation technologies need to make radical changes in order to meet the demands of the energy-conscious society. Advanced Distillation Technologies: Design, Control and Applications gives a deep and broad insight into integrated separations using non-conventional arrangements, including both current and upcoming process intensification technologies.  It includes:  Key concepts in distillation technology Principles of design, control, sizing and economics of distillation Dividing-wall column (DWC) – design, configurations, optimal operation and energy efficient and advanced control DWC applications in ternary separations, azeotropic, extractive and reactive distillation Heat integrated distillation column (HIDiC) – design, equipment and configurations Heat-pump assisted applications (MVR, TVR, AHP, CHRP, TAHP and others) Cyclic distillation technology – concepts, modeling approach, design and control issues Reactive distillation – fundamentals, equipment, applications, feasibility scheme Results of rigorous simulations in Mathworks Matlab \& Simulink, Aspen Plus, Dynamics and Custom Modeler  Containing abundant examples and industrial case studies, this is a unique resource that tackles the most advanced distillation technologies – all the way from the conceptual design to practical implementation.

Yet that's exactly what we do. Why?In a world where information refreshes endlessly and the workday feels like a race to react to other people's priorities faster, frazzled and distracted has become our default position. But what if the exhaustion of constant busyness wasn't mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel and start taking control of your time and attention? That's what this book is about.As creators of Google Ventures' renowned "design sprint," Jake and John have helped hundreds of teams solve important problems by changing how they work. Building on the success of these sprints and their experience designing ubiquitous tech products from Gmail to YouTube, they spent years experimenting with their own habits and routines, looking for ways to help people optimize their energy, focus, and time. Now they've packaged the most effective tactics into a four-step daily framework that anyone can use to systematically design their days. Make Time is not a one-size-fits-all formula. Instead, it offers a customizable menu of bite-size tips and strategies that can be tailored to individual habits and lifestyles. Make Time isn't about productivity, or checking off more to-dos. Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like throwing out your smartphone or swearing off social media. Making time isn't about radically overhauling your lifestyle; it's about making small shifts in your environment to liberate yourself from constant busyness and distraction.A must-read for anyone who has ever thought, If only there were more hours in the day..., Make Time will help you stop passively reacting to the demands of the modern world and start intentionally making time for the things that matter.},

However, using proven techniques based on experience and mathematical and/or design models can minimize risk and uncertainty when scaling up fluidized beds. Scaling, which maintains that certain dimensionless groups be matched in different sized units for hydrodynamic similarity to be achieved, is different than scale-up, and generally can not be applied to pilot plants used for scale-up. Scaling is typically more useful to be applied to cold model studies that can be used to improve the operation of an existing plant. Deep fluidized beds of Group A materials can cause significant gas bypassing leading to poor gas-solids contacting. Because commercial beds are generally deeper than beds used in pilot plants, care must be taken to ensure that beds that do not exhibit gas bypassing in smaller units, do not have gas bypassing in commercial systems.},

The main design parameters are determined and the DCFB system, which promises large scale applicability, is introduced. The DCFB reactor system features effective control of the solid circulation rate via the primary fast fluidized bed (air reactor) without changing the fluidization regime in the secondary reactor (fuel reactor). Therefore, the secondary reactor can be optimized on fuel conversion without affecting the global solid circulation rates. The air reactor design can focus on the transportation of the solids to the fuel reactor.

The DSDs determined by the model at different locations in a two-phase flow are evaluated by comparing them to experimental observations obtained in an icing wind tunnel. The satisfactory coincidence between simulation and experimental results proves that the model is reliable when modeling two-phase flows under icing conditions.

	abstract     = {The goal of this article is to chart and analyse the development and economical performance of fluidized bed combustion (FBC) and its derivates circulating fluidized bed (CFB) and bubbling fluidized bed (BFB). A descriptive overview is given of the technology and the market penetration is discussed. To make further analysis possible a database is constructed. This database comprises technological and economical data on 491 FBC projects. Analysis of these projects shows that the technology variants (CFB and BFB) diffused differently over time. Drivers, which influenced the market diffusion and technological development are market regulation, environmental legislation and RD\&D programs. Important drivers for FBC technology are fuel availability, required applications in the market, innovation spill over and competing technologies. In this article technical characteristics are charted, which show improvements in fuel diversification, technical availability, efficiency and emissions. In terms of economical performance the results show a decline in specific investment cost. Finally, the effect of technological learning and experience on the economical performance of FBC technology is analysed using the experience curve method and theory on economies of scale. A problem with applying the experience curve method is that it is not used often for large power plants like FBC plants and with it lacking a methodological standard. A method is therefore suggested. The analyses yielded progress ratios (PR) from 0.42 to 0.93 for different groups of projects (new plant, repower, retrofit, add-on and conversion) and different parts of the capital breakdown (total project price, engineering, procurement and construction price and boiler price). This means that the specific investment prices (in \$/kWe) decline with, respectively, 58\% and 7\% with every doubling of cumulative installed capacity (in MWe). The progress ratio found for new FBC plants lies between 0.90 and 0.93. These values correspond with the average PR of 0.90 found for power plants in the literature. Further results show that economies of scale have a significant influence on the investment price. Scale factors are found in the range of 0.62–0.81 for different groups of projects. According to these scale factors specific investment price decreases, respectively, between 25\% and 12\% with every doubling of plant capacity (in MWe).},

	abstract     = {Background: Ultrasonic cleaners are used for fine cleaning of medical devices, removing soil from joints, crevices, lumens, and other areas that are difficult to clean using other methods. To accomplish this fine cleaning, ultrasonic cleaners use a process known as cavitation. To understand the function of the cavitation process on items that require enhanced cleaning, a study was conducted to determine whether four commercially available products claiming to test for cavitation actually detect cavitation activity.Methods: Each of the products selected for the study were placed into a Mason jar containing cleaning solution at temperatures of 77°F (25°C) and 100°F (38°C), with no cavitation energy generated. The jars were agitated by vigorous manual shaking for five seconds (one time per minute for 15 minutes) by the same operator. The results of the commercial testing products were interpreted according to manufacturers' instructions for use and recorded following the 15-minute agitation process. Each test was repeated three times.Results: Three of the four commercially available tests claiming to detect cavitation were demonstrated to not be specific to cavitation. Each of the three tests satisfied the criteria for passing when in the absence of cavitation.Conclusion: Cavitation is an important and necessary function of all ultrasonic cleaners. The results of the study clearly demonstrate that even when no cavitation is being produced, certain tests will still provide results indicating the presence of cavitation. Those tests do not distinguish between cavitation energy and the other parameters in an ultrasonic cleaner.},

For the carried out numerical investigations a 3D TLBM framework is derived. Therein the hydrodynamic side is solved with a D3Q19 multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator and interpolated bounce back schemes. For the thermal side two different collision operators namely Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) and MRT are applied and compared against each other. Furthermore, the impact of the LBM mesh structure is examined by comparing a D3Q7 and a D3Q19 model for the thermal side. Thermal diffusion and convection-diffusion problems for plane and curved boundaries are then studied and the results are validated against analytical solutions, when available or compared to established closure correlations. Furthermore, the best collision operator and boundary conditions - regarding numerical accuracy and stability - are selected to investigate convective-diffusive interphase heat transfer inside different static, random particle/fluid systems for varying porosities, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Obtained results are compared against published correlations. In addition a new closure correlation for drag forces and particle averaged Nusselt numbers in random particle packings in the range of ε = 0.6 − 1, Rep = 20 − 500 and Pr = 0.5 − 1.5 is proposed.},

	abstract     = {Discrete element methods are extremely helpful in understanding the complex behaviors of granular media, as they give valuable insight into all internal variables of the system. In this paper, a novel discrete element method for performing simulations of granular media is presented, based on the minimization of the potential energy in the system. Contrary to most discrete element methods (i.e., soft-particle method, event-driven method, and non-smooth contact dynamics), the system does not evolve by (approximately) integrating Newtons equations of motion in time, but rather by searching for mechanical equilibrium solutions for the positions of all particles in the system, which is mathematically equivalent to locally minimizing the potential energy. The new method allows for the rapid creation of jammed initial conditions (to be used for further studies) and for the simulation of quasi-static deformation problems. The major advantage of the new method is that it allows for truly static deformations. The system does not evolve with time, but rather with the externally applied strain or load, so that there is no kinetic energy in the system, in contrast to other quasi-static methods. The performance of the algorithm for both types of applications of the method is tested. Therefore we look at the required number of iterations, for the system to converge to a stable solution. For each single iteration, the required computational effort scales linearly with the number of particles. During the process of creating initial conditions, the required number of iterations for two-dimensional systems scales with the square root of the number of particles in the system. The required number of iterations increases for systems closer to the jamming packing fraction. For a quasi-static pure shear deformation simulation, the results of the new method are validated by regular soft-particle dynamics simulations. The energy minimization algorithm is able to capture the evolution of the isotropic and deviatoric stress and fabric of the system. Both methods converge in the limit of quasi-static deformations, but show interestingly different results otherwise. For a shear amplitude of \$\$4\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$\$, as little as 100 sampling points seems to be a good compromise between accuracy and computational time needed.},

	abstract     = {The efficacy of nanoporous crystalline materials in separation applications is often influenced to a significant extent by diffusion of guest molecules within the pores of the structural frameworks. The Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) equations provide a fundamental and convenient description of mixture diffusion. The M–S formulation highlights two separate factors that cause mixture diffusion to be intrinsically coupled: correlation effects, and thermodynamic coupling. By careful and detailed analyses of a variety of published experimental data on (a) mixture permeation across nanoporous membranes, (b) transient uptake of mixtures within crystals, and (c) transient breakthrough characteristics of fixed bed adsorbers, we identify conditions that require the use of M–S equations including both correlation effects and thermodynamic coupling. Situations are also identified in which either of the coupling effects can be ignored. Correlation effects cause slowing-down of more-mobile-less-strongly-adsorbed molecules by tardier-more-strongly-adsorbed-partner species; such slowing-down effects are often essential for modeling mixture permeation across nanoporous membranes. Overshoots in the transient uptake of the more mobile partners in single crystals are essentially the consequence of thermodynamic coupling, originating from sizable off-diagonal elements of thermodynamic correction factors Γij. In the case of transient breakthrough of hexane isomers in a fixed bed of MFI zeolite, we show that thermodynamic coupling effects lead to a significant improvement in the separation performance.},

	abstract     = {The primary objective of this article is to investigate the possibility of inter-relating the characteristics of unary, binary, and ternary mixtures across microporous zeolite membranes. Towards this end, we performed Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations of mixture adsorption equilibrium, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of guest diffusivities in unary (CO2, CH4, N2, and H2), binary (CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, CH4/N2, CO2/H2), and ternary (CO2/CH4/N2, CO2/CH4/H2, CO2/N2/H2) mixtures in four zeolites: CHA, DDR, MFI, and FAU. The combined CBMC and MD data are used to obtain fundamental insights into the adsorption, diffusion, and permeation characteristics of the variety of guest/host combinations. Application of the Myers-Prausnitz theory shows that the adsorption selectivity for the i-j pair, Sads,ij, in ternary mixtures has practically the same value as for the binary i-j mixture, provided the comparison is made as the same surface potential Φ, a convenient and practical proxy for the spreading pressure π, that is calculable on the basis of the data on the unary isotherms of the constituent guests. For the mixtures investigated, departures from thermodynamic idealities do not cause deviations from the uniqueness of the Sads,ij~vs~Φ dependence because the ratios of the activity coefficients γi/γj also appear to uniquely depend on Φ. The surface potential Φ is also the thermodynamically correct metric to describe the loading dependence of diffusivities. Compared at the same Φ, the diffusion selectivity for the i-j pair, Sdiff,ij, in ternary mixtures has practically the same value as for the binary i-j mixture. Consequently, the permeation selectivity, Sperm,ij=Sads,ij×Sdiff,ij is also uniquely dependent on Φ. When compared at the same Φ, the component permeabilities, Πi for CO2, CH4, and N2 are found to be independent of the partners in the binary and ternary mixtures investigated and have practically the same as the values for the corresponding unary permeabilities.},

	abstract     = {With increasing computer power simulation methods addressing discrete problems in a broad range of scientific fields become more and more available. The discrete element method is one of these discontinuous approaches used for modeling granular assemblies. Within this method the dynamics of a system of particles is modeled by tracking the motion of individual particles and their interaction with their adjacencies over time. For the interaction of particles, force models need to be specified. The resulting equations of motion are of coupled ordinary differential configuration, which are usually solved by explicit numerical schemes. In large-scale systems like avalanches, planetary rings, hoppers or chemical reactors vast numbers of particles need to be addressed. Therefore, integration schemes need to be accurate on the one hand, but also numerically efficient on the other hand. This numerical efficiency is characterized by the method’s demand for memory and CPU-time. In this paper a number of mostly explicit numerical integration schemes are reviewed and applied to the benchmark problem of a particle impacting a fixed wall as investigated experimentally by Gorham and Kharaz [Gorham, D. A., \& Kharaz, A. H. (2000). The measurement of particle rebound characteristics. Powder Technology, 112(3), 193–202]. The accurate modeling which includes the correct integration of the equations of motion is essential. In discrete simulation methods the accuracy of properties on the single particle level directly influence the global properties of the granular assembly like velocity distributions, porosities or flow rates, whereas their correct knowledge is often of key interest in engineering applications. The impact experiment is modeled with simple force displacement approaches which allow an analytical solution of the problem. Aspects discussed are the dependency of the step size on the accuracy of certain collision properties and the related computing time. The effect of a fixed time step is analyzed. Guidelines for the efficient selection of an integration scheme considering the additional computational cost by contact detection and force calculation are presented.},

In order of increasing flow complexity, the present study first looks at the importance of drag coefficient and inlet conditions to particle track calculations in a vertical duct. The same analysis is then performed for two-phase horizontal flows, where gravitational settling starts to exert a stronger influence over the distribution of particles within the flow domain. All computations carried out take into account the effect of Saffman force and particle-wall collisions. Although both flows considered could be reasonably regarded as two dimensional, knowledge gained from such a study is expected to be also applicable to three-dimensional gassolid flow problems.},

Three correlations for ‘m’ have been proposed for unpromoted and promoted beds with rod and blade promoters. The comparison of the results reveals that the Godard–Richardson equation is more suitable for unpromoted beds in the original form. In the case of promoted beds, the prediction deviates from the corresponding experimental values due to poor representation of flow parameter. Hence, the flow parameter of the Godard–Richardson equation has also been modified for beds with rod and blade promoters. A comparison has been made between the predicted values of bed expansion using the modified Godard–Richardson equation and the predicted vlaues obtained by correlations developed by Kumar and Roy (2002a) and the corresponding experimental values.},

Three different sets of Kenics mixer (aspect ratio = 1.5) comprised of 3, 9 and 25 elements each have been characterized. The Reynolds number was varied in the range of 1 to 25,000 (i.e., from laminar to turbulent flow regime). The numerical approach takes into account the aspects of the fluid flow at higher Reynolds number values including circumferential velocity profiles at different cross-sections within the Kenics mixer, which were neglected in previous studies. It was observed that cross-sectional mixing in the turbulent flow regime takes place up to 30\% of each element length at element-to-element transition; beyond that velocity profiles were uniform. The experiments were also carried out to measure the circumferential and axial velocity profiles and pressure drop in three different Kenics Mixers using air as fluid. The pressure drop per unit element ( P/η) was found to be independent of the number of Kenics mixing elements used in the system. The total pressure drop across Kenics mixer obtained by CFD simulations were compared with the experimental pressure drop values and correlations available in the literature. The numerical results were found in good agreement with the experimental as well as the results reported in the literature. A new pressure drop correlation in the Kenics static mixer has been developed.},

Here, we integrate the various stages of SciML under the umbrella of ChatGPT, to formulate CrunchGPT, which plays the role of a conductor orchestrating the entire workflow of SciML based on simple prompts by the user. Specifically, we present two examples that demonstrate the potential use of CrunchGPT in optimizing airfoils in aerodynamics, and in obtaining flow fields in various geometries in interactive mode, with emphasis on the validation stage. To demonstrate the flow of the CrunchGPT, and create an infrastructure that can facilitate a broader vision, we built a webapp based guided user interface, that includes options for a comprehensive summary report. The overall objective is to extend CrunchGPT to handle diverse problems in computational mechanics, design, optimization and controls, and general scientific computing tasks involved in SciML, hence using it as a research assistant tool but also as an educational tool. While here the examples focus in fluid mechanics, future versions will target solid mechanics and materials science, geophysics, systems biology and bioinformatics.},

Our experimental results reveal that the droplet breakup regimes, namely, obstruction, tunnel, combined, non-breakup, and parallel, are the functions of xanthan gum concentration and the continuous phase flow rate. We examined the influence of fluid properties on droplet breakup stages by varying the xanthan gum concentration in an aqueous solution that exhibited increasing shear-thinning and elastic properties with its concentration. Four sequential stages (squeezing, transition, pinch-off, and filament thinning) are identified during the droplet breakup process. We found that upstream pressure controlled the squeezing stage, and fluid properties mainly steered the filament rupture stage. A complex interaction between elastic, capillary, and inertial forces further divided the final stage into the stretching and fluid-drainage stages. The Hencky strain characterized the formation of a persistent cylindrical filament in the stretching stage that decayed exponentially in the fluid-drainage stage. Eventually, this study highlights the significance of parallel branches with asymmetric geometric confinements on droplet splitting. Enhanced asymmetry is observed for the elongated filament, emphasizing the dominance of feedback from the downstream confinement.},

	abstract     = {Rotary desiccant air conditioning system, which combines the technologies of desiccant dehumidification and evaporative cooling, is advantageous in being free from CFCs, using low grade thermal energy and controlling humidity and temperature separately. Compared with conventional vapor compression air conditioning system, it preserves the merits of environment-friendly, energy saving, healthy, comfortable, etc. Ongoing research and development works suggest that new desiccant materials and novel system configurations have significant potential for improving the performance and reliability and reducing the cost and size of rotary desiccant dehumidification and air conditioning system, thereby increasing its market competitiveness and breaking out the current fairly small niche market. For the purpose of providing an overview of recent efforts on these issues and showing how rotary desiccant air conditioning systems can be designed and coupled to available thermal energy, this paper presents and analyzes the status of rotary desiccant dehumidification and air conditioning in the following three aspects: the development of advanced desiccant materials, the optimization of system configuration and the utilization of solar energy and other low grade heat sources, such as solar energy, district heating, waste heat and bioenergy. Some key problems to further push forward the research and development of this technology are also summarized.},

Multicomponent alloys are subject to complex interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters and display a rich variety of microstructural features which are not seen in binary alloys. Achieving microstructural control of multicomponent alloys is central to their efficacy in specific applications. Unraveling the chemistry-thermomechanical processing-microstructure relationships in multicomponent alloys only through experiments have been proven to be a resource intensive approach. Quantitative simulations of microstructural evolution in multicomponent alloys using the technique of phase-field modeling can significantly offset the experimental burden and provide an energy efficient and sustainable framework for alloy design. In this review, we focus on those phase-field models which can consider the evolution of multiple phases simultaneously in a multicomponent system and attempt to understand the history of their emergence as tools of predictive value. We briefly review the studies conducted with such multiphase, multicomponent phase-field models and conclude with a commentary on the future role of phase-field modeling towards the sustainable development of novel multicomponent alloys.},

For this purpose two different gas–solid flow configurations laden with small and large particles are considered, namely an axisymmetric particle-laden jet flow and an upward pipe flow. As a result, the consistent terms are able to reproduce both situations, suppression and enhancement of fluid turbulence for small and large particles, whereas the standard terms can only deal with situations implying turbulence attenuation.},

Experiments and calculations are carried out for different spherical glass beads with diameters between 60 and 625 μm and mass loadings up to 1.0 (kg particles/kg gas). Additionally, stainless steel walls with different wall roughness are considered. In all experiments the air volume flow rate is constant in order to maintain a fixed gas average velocity of 20 m/s. As a result, the pressure drop in the channel is strongly influenced by wall roughness. Higher wall roughness implies higher pressure drop because of the increase in wall collision frequency, whereby momentum is extracted from the fluid due to two-way coupling. The numerical computations were performed by the Euler/Lagrange approach accounting for two-way and four-way coupling. For the calculation of the particle motion all relevant forces (i.e. drag, transverse lift and gravity), inter-particle collisions and wall collisions with wall roughness were considered. The agreement of the computations with the experiments was found to be very good for the gas and particle velocities as well as the pressure drop. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

COD reduction of 19.58\% was achieved with the conventional biological oxidation, which was demonstrated to be improved by incorporating acoustic cavitation-based pretreatment approaches under optimized conditions of 125~W and 70\% duty cycle for only AC as well as oxidant loadings as 1000~mg/L for H2O2, 250~mg/L Fe(II) with 1000~mg/L H2O2 for Fenton, 1000~mg/L for KPS and 0.5~L/min for the O3 during the combination approaches. The improved COD reduction after the use of pretreatment approaches followed by the BO of 6~h duration was 29.26\%, 72.42\%, 85.47\%, 45.68\% and 69.26\% for the AC, AC~+~H2O2, AC~+~Fenton, AC~+~KPS and AC~+~O3 based approaches respectively. The toxicity assay of the effluent before and after every pretreatment approach using bacterial strains ofStaphylococcus aureusandPseudomonas aeruginosaensured the biodegradability of the treated effluent as no toxic intermediates could be seen.

The results showed that the crackability of slurry was lower than that of FCC feedstock, due to the difference of their properties. About 30 wt.\% heavy oil remained in the product after the slurry was cracked, but its end point declined and the heavier component decreased. The comparison of slurry cracking results at different reaction temperatures and regenerated catalyst contents indicated that the appropriate operating conditions for slurry conversion were the reaction temperature of 500 8C and the regenerated catalyst content within 25–50 wt.\%.},

An original catalyst is proposed which allows the determination ofkLa with more or less coalescing liquids. The order of magnitude of the rate constant is determined at different catalyst concentrations, allowing the use of hydrazine oxidation by air as a chemical reaction which is slow in the mass transfer film but fast in the bulk of the liquid. Examples of determinations ofkLa in very different contactors are presented (liquid motivated ejector, centrifugal film absorber, cocurrent upflow packed-bed column).},

Discrete element methods (DEM) present an opportunity to study such interactions. In gas-particle flows with higher solids loadings, particle-particle interactions give rise to particle clustering and/or microstructure formation. In this paper we show how DEM can be used to determine not only the particle-phase stress (required for gas-particle two-fluid CFD models) in the case of particle clustering, but also how DEM can be used to determine the nature, size and composition of the observed microstructure.},

	abstract     = {Liquid feeds are injected into fluidized bed reactors such as fluid cokers, fluid catalytic crackers and gas-phase polymerization reactors. In these industrial processes, it is of crucial importance to optimize the contact between the injected liquid and the bed solids to minimize agglomeration, to ensure good reactor operability, and to allow reactions to proceed under minimum heat and mass transfer limitations in order to maximize the yields of valuable products. It has been shown [P. House, M. Saberian, C. Briens, F. Berruti, E. Chan, Injection of a liquid spray into a fluidized bed: particle–liquid mixing and impact on fluid coker yields. Industrial \& Engineering Chemistry Research 43 (2004) 5663–5669., S. Bruhns, J. Werther, An investigation of the mechanism of liquid injection into fluidized beds. AIChE Journal 51 (2005) 766–775] that the nozzle technology and the operating conditions have a significant effect on the quality of the liquid–solid interaction resulting from the injection of gas-atomized liquid feed. The goal of this study was to develop a rapid and reliable experimental technique to assess the liquid–solid contact efficiency resulting from the injection of a liquid feed into a fluidized bed. Air-fluidized silica sand particles were first charged by triboelectrification as a result of their random collisions with the inner walls of the fluidized bed. Immediately after the injection of water through an aerated nozzle, the fluidization air was stopped and the wetted bed solids were allowed to settle. While the bed was defluidized, the triboelectric charges accumulated on the particles migrated to a grounded electrode through the low-resistance paths offered by the conductive liquid. A stronger electric current flowing through the electrode indicated that the liquid was more evenly distributed on the solid particles. The intensity of the current flowing through the electrode was, therefore, used to define a spray nozzle performance index. This technique was used to examine the effect of increasing the nozzle aeration, and, specifically, the gas-to-liquid mass ratio (G/L) through the nozzle on the liquid–solid contact efficiency. The results showed that changing the nozzle geometry can change how the contact efficiency between atomized liquid and fluidized solids varies with (G/L), especially at relatively high G/L ratios. A model of the time-evolution of the electric current generated during defluidization of the bed solids is also presented.},

Progress, 48, p. 89–94) and the Wen and Yu (1966, Chem. Eng. Progr. Symp. Ser., 62, p. 100–110) empirical correlations, has been widely used in the literature. Physically, the drag is known to be a continuous function of both the solid volume fraction and the Reynolds number, though the transition between the two correlations proposed by Gidaspow (1994) is discontinuous in solid volume fraction. In the present work, the effect of (i) the volume fraction chosen for transition and (ii) the form of the function used when “stitching” the Ergun (1954) and Wen and Yu (1966) correlations on the bubbling behavior of gas-fluidized beds is studied. A Multi-Phase Particle-in-Cell (MP-PIC) model is used for these purposes. In addition to the discontinuous stitching method, other methods based on arctan and linear functions are also considered. Two test monodisperse systems are examined: (i) an injected bubble in a gas-fluidized bed held close to its minimum fluidization velocity, and (ii) a freely-bubbling, gas-fluidized bed at several times the minimum fluidization velocity. In the injected-bubble system, the dynamic pressure drop profile, bubble growth rate, bubble structure at end of the injection period, detachment time, and average solid volume fraction within the bubble are examined. In the freely-bubbling bed, the time-averaged histogram of equivalent diameter, bubble equivalent diameter as a function of height, time-averaged mean pierced length, the time-averaged bubble flux (i.e., visible bubble flow), and radial mean of the time-averaged bubble flux were investigated. Overall, the bubble properties are affected by the location of the transition point, whereas the chosen form of the continuous stitching function has little impact.},

These phenomena greatly affect product and coke yields. Several models have been proposed to estimate the vaporization of feed droplets in the riser injection zone. However, depending on the assumptions on which the model is based, completely different vaporization times may be predicted. No experimental validation exists to discriminate between the various models. This paper presents the first method for the accurate measurement of the vaporization kinetics of a liquid spray injected into a hot fluidized bed. The droplet size has a very strong effect on the vaporization. With a droplet size of 60 mm, it takes about 100 ms to vaporize 50\% of the liquid; with a droplet size of 30 mm, this time is cut by half. \# 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract     = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is considered essential for climate change mitigation, and a fast and accurate model is necessary for its control and operation in practical applications. In this study, various machine learning methods are used to develop data-based models for PEMFC performance attributes and internal states. Techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine Regressor (SVR) are used to predict the cell voltage, membrane resistance, and membrane hydration level for various operating conditions. Varying input features such as cell current, temperature, reactant pressures, and humidity are introduced to evaluate the accuracy of the model, especially under extreme conditions. Two different sets of data are considered in this study, which are acquired from, a physics-based semiempirical model and a 1-D reduced-dimension Computational Fluid Dynamics model, respectively. The aspect of data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning procedures are investigated that are extensively used to calibrate the artificial neural network layers and support vector regressor to predict the fuel cell attributes. ANN clearly shows an advantage in comparison with SVR, especially on a multivariable output regression. However, the SVR is advantageous to model simple regressions as it greatly reduces the level of computation without sacrificing accuracy. Data-based models for PEMFC are successfully developed on both the data sets by adapting advanced modeling techniques and calibration procedures such as ANN incorporating the dropout technique, resulting in an R2 ≥ 0.99 for all the predicted variables, demonstrating the ability to build accurate data-based models solely on data from validated physics-based models, reducing the dependency on extensive experimentation.},

	abstract     = {A generalized description of the rebound of spherical drops or solid spheres over a wall is proposed using two parameters: a coefficient of restitution that compares the velocity of restitution to the velocity before impact and the contact time with the wall. During the bouncing, the incident kinetic energy is transferred into deformation energy (stored on the surface for the case of liquid drops or in the bulk for the case of solid particles) and then restored into kinetic energy allowing the particle to leave or not the wall. The corresponding criteria is given by the Stokes number that compares the inertia of the particle (added mass included) and the viscous force exerted on the particle during the drainage of the film formed between the particle and the wall. The general behavior of the coefficient of restitution observed in many experiments can be modelled for solid spheres as well as spherical drops by the use of a unique simple correlation depending on this Stokes number. For solid particles, the contact time with the wall in viscous flows is found to be of the same order as that predicted by the Hertzian theory; hence, the contact with the wall can be described as a discontinuity in the particle motion. On the other hand, for liquid drops, the contact time is significant and of the same order as other characteristic time scales of the particle motion. Therefore, to properly describe the rebound process, both a restitution coefficient and a contact time must be considered. Finally, a simple model is proposed and its predictions are compared with experiments performed for millimetric toluene drops in water.},

	abstract     = {The following part of this paper reviews existing theoretical correlations to predict the behaviour of two-phase (liquid–solid) and three-phase (liquid–solid–vapour) fluidised beds as well as models describing heat transfer coefficients. Moreover, a theoretical correlation is developed to describe heat transfer during boiling in a three-phase circulating fluidised bed. The approach uses earlier work on two-phase (liquid–vapour) flow boiling, two-phase (liquid–solid) fluidised beds and three-phase (liquid–vapour–solid) circulating fluidised beds. The correlation developed is validated against experimental data obtained in Part I of the presented paper. The model's ability to predict the experimental data has been successfully demonstrated. The developed expression for heat transfer coefficients is written as follows: i.e., When applied to experimentally obtained data for stainless steel particles (dp=1.5,2.0{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1.5{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}2.0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$} and 2.5 mm, εp=16\%{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}ε{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}16{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\%<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$}), the correlation is able to predict the experimental data within a 20\% maximum deviation.

Liquid/solid fluidized bed heat exchangers have originally been developed for desalination plants. However, due to their substantial benefits with respect to significantly improved heat transfer and fouling reduction, successful applications also exist in areas such as petrochemical, minerals and food processing as well as in the paper and power industries. The excellent performance of fluidized bed heat exchangers is related to the interaction between particles and heat transfer surface and to mixing effects in the viscous sublayer. In this paper, the results of experimental investigations on heat transfer for a wide range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are presented. New design equations have been developed for the prediction of bed voidage and heat transfer coefficients. The predictions of these correlations and of numerous correlations recommended by other authors are compared with a large database compiled from the literature. Experiments were carried out in monodisperse suspensions at which particles consisting of uniform suspension, caused to fall down counter-currently against an upflow of water in a vertical tube. The solid concentration was measured to determine particle velocity. The total solid concentration ranged from 5\% to 45\% by volume. A correction factor of (voidage)0.2 applied to the model of Garside and Al-Dibouni (1977), gives satisfactory results for reduced velocity at intermediate particle Reynolds number. The data obtained for monodisperse suspensions were tested against the published models. The modified model gives a mean sum of squares of residuals 0.0004 as well as better results than the other models in the flow range 150 {$<$} Re {$<$} 2200. Theoretical and empirical approaches to the fluid dynamic description of liquid fluidised beds are reviewed, together with the relevant experimental evidence. Attention has been focused, in the main, on steady- and unsteady-state phenomena relating to monocomponent fluidised beds, with one section devoted to binary-solid systems, the particles differing in size and/or in density. Accurate prediction of the bed voidage is essential for the calculation of liquid side heat transfer coefficients in fluidized bed heat exchangers. New experimental results for the bed voidage in annuli are presented. Various published correlations are tabulated and the inadequacy of most of these correlations is demonstrated. The most recently published correlation of Hirata and Bulos in conjunction with the Richardson—Zaki model predicts bed voidage in annuli with a standard deviation of about 6\%. The flow characteristics of inverse fluidization utilizing low density spherical particles are experimentally investigated for both the liquid—solid and gas—liquid—solid systems. The experimental data for the bed expansion in the liquid-solid system are correlated, both empirically and semi-empirically. In the gas—liquid—solid system in which the gas and liquid flows are countercurrent, two modes of fluidization are examined. They are fluidization with the liquid as a continuous phase and fluidization with the gas as a continuous phase; the former characterizes the inverse gas—liquid—solid fluidized bed, while the latter characterizes the turbulent contacting bed. A flow regime diagram which portrays these modes of fluidization is presented. Correlations of the bed expansion and gas hold-up are proposed for the inverse gas—liquid—solid fluidization.},

	abstract     = {An analytical model for gas-solid suspension flow through an inclined section of pipe was developed. This model predicts the ratio of the total pressure drop in an inclined pipe to that of a horizontal pipe. The model has been used to predict the critical pipe angle, which is defined as the angle at which the maximum pressure drop for a given solids flow rate is achieved. This angle differs from 90° (found in a single-phase flow) and is directly proportional to the ratio between the gas superficial velocity and the particle terminal velocity. The three-dimensional conservation equations for steady-state two-phase flow in an inclined pipe were solved numerically for constant solids and gas flow rates at different pipe inclinations. This model was based on the continuum theory for describing the mass and momentum balance equations for the fluid and solid phases. A packing model, describing the shear stress of the solid phase as a function of its volume fraction, is suggested in order to limit the maximum value of the solid volume fraction. A new model for particle-wall interaction was developed taking into account the angle of inclination of the pipe. The prediction of the numerical model was compared with experimental data obtained in a specially designed test rig. In general, the agreement between the experimental data and the models was satisfactory. The results of the numerical simulation also confirmed that the critical pipe angle for gas-solid flow is lower than 90°. The assumptions made during the development of the models were assessed in order to explain the differences between the predicted and measured values of the flow parameters for different flow regimes. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

Fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) particles (qp = 1300 kg/m3, dp = 69 Am) were used. When the solids circulation flux is 400 kg/m2Ás, the apparent solids holdup exceeds 20\% near the top of the riser A, and the volumetric solids fraction (apparent solids holdup) is larger than 5.2\% in the fully developed region of the downer. Hence, a high particle suspension density covers the entire coupled CFB system. Under the high-density conditions, the primary air rate had a small influence on the solids circulation flux, while the secondary air rate had an important effect on it. The results indicate a particle acceleration region and a fully developed region were identified along the downer from the pressure gradient profiles. In the fully developed region of the downer, the volumetric solids fraction increases with increasing solids circulation flux or decreasing superficial gas velocity U1.},

This work aims to develop a multiscale model that directly resolves the largescale cavities and models small discrete bubbles. The volume of fluid (VOF) method and the Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model are first adopted to represent the phase field of water and vapor from a macroscale point of view. A discrete bubble model (DBM) based on the Lagrangian formulation is then developed to simulate the microscale cavitation bubbles that are smoothed in the macroscale model due to the limited mesh resolution. The transition between DBM and VOF is also implemented to achieve the multiscale simulation. For modeling of the turbulence, the scale adaptive simulation approach is used. The tip-leakage cavitating flows induced by the NACA0009 hydrofoil under the conditions with different gaps according to the reported experiment are simulated. Results show that, using the proposed multiscale model, better agreements can be obtained compared with the macroscale model, and specific phenomena can be well revealed including the bubble nucleation, growth and collapse, the interaction between discrete bubbles and large-scale cavities.},

Meanwhile, the volume of fluid (VOF) method is suitable for resolving the interface, while the discrete particle model (DPM) under the Lagrangian frame better simulates unresolvable particles; a multiscale VOF–DPM combined model is urgently needed for multiscale multiphase flows. The present work implements a VOF–DPM solver that includes a two-way transition algorithm to model the transformation between discrete and continuous phases for bubbles or droplets using OpenFOAM. The interface-capturing scheme in the solver is based on the interIsoFoam solver, which supports the geometric reconstruction of the interface and adaptive mesh refinement. A connected component labeling approach is used for particle detection and VOF-to-DPM transition for discrete bubbles or droplets produced by interface breakup. Conversely, a DPM-to-VOF transition algorithm for particles touching the interface is incorporated to achieve a twoway transition. In addition, phase change modeling between continuous phases and bubble dynamic modeling for cavitating flow cases are also implemented in the solver. Test simulations are performed for validation, including the gas–liquid two-phase dam break and cavitating flow in a convergent–divergent test section. The results demonstrate that the solver is reasonably accurate and can adequately represent the complex phase structure, including the interface and discrete particles.},

To simulate the multiphase systems, the authors’ group has developed a numerical method that couples the discrete element method (DEM) and the volume of fluid (VOF) method, where the local volume average technique is employed. When the unresolved DEM-VOF method is applied to industrial systems, there are two critical problems: one is the inflexibility to select the grid size for the gas–liquid–flow simulations, and the other is the heavy computational cost due to a large number of particles. To solve these problems, a novel numerical method is proposed by introducing the refined grid model and coarse-grained model into the unresolved DEM-VOF method. Two types of verification tests are performed to illustrate the adequacy of the new method. First, a water entry problem of solid particles is simulated to verify the combination of the refined grid model and the unresolved DEM-VOF method. Second, a gas–solid–liquid fluidized bed system is computed to verify the combination of the refined grid model, the coarse-grained DEM method, and the unresolved DEM-VOF method. Through the verification tests, it is demonstrated that the new method can flexibly give the grid size for the VOF regardless of the solid particle size. Besides, the new approach makes it possible to reduce the calculation time of the DEM to 4.6\% of the original time. The new approach will drastically improve the numerical modeling for gas–solid–liquid flows from the viewpoint of efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility.},

The influences of the conveying differential pressure, the coal moisture content, the gas volume flow rate and the superficial velocity, on the solid-gas ratios, were investigated. The Shannon entropy analysis of the pressure fluctuation time series was developed to reveal the flow characteristics. By investigation of the distribution of the Shannon entropy at different conditions, the flow stability and the evolutional tendency of Shannon entropy, in different regimes and regime transition processes, were revealed, and the relationship between Shannon entropy and the flow regime was also established. The results indicate that the solid-gas ratio and the Shannon entropy rise with increases in conveying differential pressure. The solid-gas ratio and the Shannon entropy reveal preferable correlation with the superficial gas velocity. Shannon entropy is different for different flow regimes, and can be used to identify the flow regimes. Both the mass flow rate and the Shannon entropy, decrease with increases in moisture content. Shannon entropy analysis is a feasible approach to researching the characteristics of the flow regime, the flow stability and the flow regime transitions in dense-phase pneumatic conveying systems, at high pressure.},

	abstract     = {The performance of fluidized beds is strongly influenced by bubble behavior. Among various hydrodynamic properties, bubble size distributions are of prime concern, but in practice, bubble size is not readily measured. When a probe is used to determine bubble size, it intersects a bubble with a chord length other than the largest vertical dimension. The relationships between the size distribution of bubbles in the bed, the size distribution of bubbles touching the probe and the distribution of chord lengths must be resolved for correct interpretation of probe signals. A method for translating statistical parameters, namely mean and standard deviation of chord lengths to mean and standard deviation of bubble sizes, and an approach to infer the size distribution of bubbles touching the probe and the size distribution of bubbles in the bed system by using the distribution of chord lengths measured by a probe in closed form are proposed for the first time.},

	abstract     = {A model for gas–liquid–solid three-phase uidized beds with concurrent gas–liquid up- ow is proposed, which is formulated on the basis of the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) method for gas–solid two-phase ow. The three-phase uidization system is resolved into the suspending and transporting subsystem and the energy dissipation subsystem, and the former is further divided into three sub-subsystems: liquid–solid phase, gas phase and inter-phase. Force balance is analyzed at three di erent scales: micro-scale of particles, meso-scale of bubbles and macro-scale of the whole system. In addition to the analysis of multi-scale interactions, the energy consumption in the system is analyzed to establish the stability condition for the system, which is considered indispensable due to the multiplicity of three-phase uidized beds. The total energy of the system consumed with respect to unit mass of particles is resolved into two portions: suspending and transporting energy and dissipated energy. The stability condition is reached when the suspending and transporting energy of the system, Nst, is at its minimum. The model ÿrst formulated as a nonlinear programming problem consisting of six variables and seven constraints, is solved by using the general reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm. The calculated results show that the stability condition, Nst = min, can be stated alternately as db = db max. Thus, the model is ÿnally simpliÿed to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

Fluidized catalytic cracking ŽFCC. particles Ž rp s 1300 kgrm3, dp s 70 mm. and two types of glass beads Ž rp s 2500 kgrm3, dp s 123 and 332 mm. were used. A particle acceleration region and a fully developed region were identified along the column from the pressure gradient profiles. In the fully developed region, solids holdup decreases with the gas velocity but increases linearly with the solids circulation rate. The latter results in nearly constant particle velocities over a large range of solids flux at given gas velocities. Particle velocity also increases linearly with the gas velocity. Particle properties seem not to affect the mean particle velocity much, but smaller andror lighter particles give larger solid holdups. A solids holdup as high as 10–20\% has been achieved. Comparison of the results obtained here with those from an upflow riser shows inherent similarities between the two gas–solids co-current flow systems. In the fully developed region, the apparent solids holdup calculated from the pressure gradient agreed well with the actual solids holdup measured by a pair of pinch valves under not very high gas velocities, but was underestimated at higher gas velocities due to the increased wall friction loss. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fines smaller than 20 Am contribute 24.5\% in volume in the WSD particles. Phosphor tracer method is used. The axial backmixing of the WSD is slightly lower than the NSD. However, the lateral solids Peclet number increases linearly with the increase of the content of fines smaller than 20 Am because of the serious agglomeration of the fines, which leads to very poor lateral mixing for the WSD particles. And the solids lateral mixing for the WSD particles decreases significantly with increasing solids fraction. These results show that the particle size and the particle-size-distribution is a very important factor that controls the lateral solids mixing and hence the heat and mass transfer in lateral direction, which should be taken into full consideration in the riser reactor. And the NSD may be a good particle size distribution for the FCC riser, the lateral solids mixing of which is satisfactory in the reactor.},

It is found that nonlinear characteristics of the wall temperature time series vary with spatial position in the evaporator at given operation conditions, and thus the multi-phase flow boiling behavior. However, the signals obtained at given axial position but different heated tubes in the evaporator exhibit more similar nonlinear evolution behavior, and those measured in the same heated tube but at different axial heights in the evaporator undergo more distinct nonlinear dynamic behavior. Multi-scale phenomena in different spatial positions are also found and discussed. These transient aspects of inner wall temperatures are closely related to the average holdup of solid particles and motion of vapor bubbles in vapor–liquid–solid flow.

The effects of various parameters, which were ultrasonic time,ultrasonic power, solid-water ratio and solid-ethyl acetate ratio on the extraction rate of sulforaphane were investigated. The results showed that microwave pretreatment enhanced sulforaphane formation. Excessive size reduction did not increase or even reduced extraction rate of sulforaphane. Simultaneous hydrolysis and extraction significantly increased extraction rate of sulforaphane compared to hydrolysis followed by extraction. UAE accelerated mass transfer and the solubilization of the targeted compounds due to the acoustic cavitation effect, thus enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of glucoraphanin and the extraction rate of sulforaphane. The extraction rate of sulforaphane using UAE with simultaneous hydrolysis and extraction was 4.07-fold of the conventional extraction method. UAE was an effective method to extract sulforaphane from broccoli seeds since it led to higher yield of sulforaphane in a much shorter extraction time.},

In this work, the flow regimes in the two-dimensional μPBR were systematically studied by visual method utilizing a high-performance camera. Four typical flow regimes and characteristics were captured, and flow regime transition was revealed. Effects of gas and liquid superficial velocities, liquid physical properties, and particle sizes on liquid spreading areal fraction and pressure drop were investigated. Flow regime transition correlation of churn flow and pseudo-static flow in the μPBR was provided for the first time based on the summary of the current and previous published results.},

To get a better understanding of the agglomeration mechanism, the (de-)fluidization behavior of micron-sized iron oxide particles in a 3-D fluidized bed is investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics coupled with a coarse-grained Discrete Element Method (CFD-cgDEM). The inter-particle cohesive force is considered as a temperature-dependent solid bridge force. The coarse-grained method is first verified by comparing results for different scaling factors. Subsequently, the effects of temperature on the bed pressure drop, void fraction distribution, particle velocity distribution, and agglomerate size are investigated. In conclusion, the developed model shows the capacity for reliable prediction of particle agglomeration behavior, which can shed light on the design of the DRI process in high-temperature fluidized beds.},

These lie both on the printhead side—namely, the detailed flow inside the printhead, entrained bubbles, the meniscus dynamics, wetting phenomena at the nozzle plate, and jet formation—and on the receiving substrate side—namely, droplet impact, merging, wetting of the substrate, droplet evaporation, and drying. In most cases the droplets are multicomponent, displaying rich physicochemical hydrodynamic phenomena. The challenges on the printhead side and on the receiving substrate side are interwoven, as optimizing the process and the materials with respect to either side alone is not enough: As the same ink (or other jetted liquid) is used and as droplet frequency and size matter on both sides, the process must be optimized as a whole.},

	abstract     = {Coal is by far the largest fossil fuel resource in the U.S. with known reserves adequate to meet expected demand without major increases in production cost well beyond the year 2010. In contrast, domestic natural gas, its principal fossil fuel competitor for power generation, is a more limited resource and increases in production cost and decreased availability are projected to occur after the year 2000, thus weakening its ability to compete with coal for power generation in the U.S. Renewable and nuclear energy sources are not expected to displace coal to a major extent during the 1995–2040 time period considered here. For manufacture of liquid and gaseous fuels, coal is projected to become competitive with other resources (petroleum, oil shale and bitumen) in the 2021–2040 time period. Increasingly strict requirements for environmental management of coal-generated waste streams are also anticipated with a growing incentive to reduce CO2 production through increased efficiency. This planning model imposes demanding requirements for conversion of coal to electricity and to clean gaseous and liquid fuels and, thus, for a strategic program of research, development and commercialization to most efficiently utilize coal resources in the 21st century. This review is based on an assessment of DOE's coal research, development, demonstration and commercialization programs for the time period 1995–2040. This assessment was conducted under the auspices of the National Research Council, in response to a request from the Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. For the above time period, electric power generation is expected to dominate the use of coal, although a growing production of merchant medium Btu gas and liquid transportation fuels is anticipated during the period 2021–2040. The current DOE coal program emphasizes activities through 2010 and is focused almost exclusively on power generation technologies with small programs on other uses. Funding for many of the latter programs has been reduced significantly in recent years. The present study, with its longer time horizon, proposes an increasing emphasis on clean fuels research and on advanced research that addresses the barriers to higher efficiency in both power generation and fuels production to reduce CO2 emissions. Improvements will also be needed in control of air pollutants and the discharge of solid wastes. The power generation program addresses both near term goals that do not offer significantly higher efficiency, and also more ambitious goals based on combined cycles utilizing high performance gas turbines or fuel cells to potentially provide a 10–15 point increase in efficiency. These increases in efficiency will require extensive R\&D to overcome technological barriers. For fuel cells, high cost appears to be the major problem. For the gas turbine systems, production of a hot gas stream of sufficient purity to allow use of the very high efficiency gas turbines being developed for use with natural gas presents the major challenge. Critical components include: high temperature filters for PFBC systems; high temperature air/furnace heat exchanger for indirect fixed systems; hot gas cleanup system for PFBC and for gasification-based systems; high temperature turbine blades compatible with trace impurities that may escape the high temperature gas cleanup system; and high thermal efficiency gasification. Solution of these challenging problems will require a continued program of advanced research and component development. The choice of winners from the large array of technologies will also require augmented use of systems studies and development of realistic commercialization strategies. As natural gas prices rise, production of cleaned coal-based medium Btu gas for use in existing natural gas fueled-combined cycles and for industrial heat becomes economic and could relieve the pressure on the supply of natural gas for other uses. Conversion of this coal-based medium Btu gas to methane (SNG) might follow towards the end of the 2021–2040 time period. For this use, high efficiency oxygen blown-cold gas clean up gasification is needed. At present, however, the DOE gasification program is concentrated on air blown processes specifically aimed at integration with power generation. Production of medium Btu (synthesis gas) will allow concurrent production of hydrogen or Fischer-Tropsch liquids. The use of simplified once through processes with production of electric power from unconverted feed and low value products (such as methane) could bring costs of premium liquid fuels to a level competitive with 25–30 \$/bbl imported crude oil (DOE financing basis). Current projections indicated that the price of imported crude oil could be in this range in the 2021–2050 time frame. Direct liquefaction costs, with continued R\&D, are believed to be approximately the same as indirect liquefaction, but with 5–10\% higher efficiency and correspondingly less production of CO2. Given the long-term nature of opportunities for production of coal-derived gaseous and liquid fuels, DOE has a special role to play in supporting technology development aimed at cost reduction and efficiency improvement for these potentially important uses of coal.},

The pressure drop time series were collected with Labview 7.0 and turned into the frequency domain by using a fast Fourier transform routine. The dynamic changes observed during the coating process were paired with the power spectra, in order to create an identification procedure for the situations of low particles circulation rate, internal spout and bed collapse.

To measure these impact properties, the authors refine the experimental technique of Foersteret al. To permit straightforward incorporation in rapid granular theories, the impacts are described with three coefficients. The first is the Newtonian coefficient of normal restitution. The second represents the frictional properties of the contact surfaces. The last characterizes the restitution of the tangential component of the contact point velocity for impacts that involve negligible sliding.},

The surrounding fluid is assumed to behave in a continuum and the dispersed-fluid is assumed to be dilute such that particle–particle interactions and two-way coupling effects can be ignored. The key process considered herein is momentum transfer to the particles with emphasis on turbulent diffusion. Computational approaches are classified by their particular treatment of the continuous-phase (surrounding liquid or gas) and of the dispersedphase (solid particles, droplets, or bubbles). The most appropriate point-volume descriptions for interphase transfer of momentum are described based on current research and experimental data. Modern Lagrangian and Eulerian treatments of the dispersed-phase motion are then considered for predicting a variety of particle–fluid physical phenomenon. Finally, the “tools” (computational techniques) are summarized based on the “job” (prediction of a particular set of dispersed-phase properties) and the “cost” (required computational resources). ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract     = {The drag of a non-spherical particle was reviewed and investigated for a variety of shapes (regular and irregular) and particle Reynolds numbers (Rep). Point-force models for the trajectory-averaged drag were discussed for both the Stokes regime (Rep ≪ 1) and Newton regime (Rep ≫ 1 and sub-critical with approximately constant drag coefficient) for a particular particle shape. While exact solutions were often available for the Stokes regime, the Newton regime depended on: aspect ratio for spheroidal particles, surface area ratio for other regularly-shaped particles, and min–med–max area for irregularly shaped particles. The combination of the Stokes and Newton regimes were well integrated using a general method by Ganser (developed for isometric shapes and disks). In particular, a modified Clift–Gauvin expression was developed for particles with approximately cylindrical cross-sections relative to the flow, e.g. rods, prolate spheroids, and oblate spheroids with near-unity aspect ratios. However, particles with non-circular cross-sections exhibited a weaker dependence on Reynolds number, which is attributed to the more rapid transition to flow separation and turbulent boundary layer conditions. Their drag coefficient behavior was better represented by a modified Dallavalle drag model, by again integrating the Stokes and Newton regimes. This paper first discusses spherical particle drag and classification of particle shapes, followed by the main body which discusses drag in Stokes and Newton regimes and then combines these results for the intermediate regimes.},

To model hydrodynamic behavior in CFB risers, three phase flows were assumed in the riser, the gas phase, the dispersed particle phase, and the clusters phase. The gas–solid multi-fluid model is extended to give the macroscopic averaged equations with constitutive equations for both particle phases from kinetic theory of granular flow. The clusters and the dispersed particles have their own fluctuating energy or two individual granular temperatures. Interactions between the cluster and its surrounding dispersed particles were obtained from kinetic theory of granular flow. Drag force for gas to dispersed particles and the clusters are empirically determined. The momentum exchange between dispersed particles and clusters is modeled using the concept of molecular dynamics. Cluster properties are predicted with the cluster-based approach. The distributions of volume fractions and velocities of gas, dispersed particles and clusters are predicted. Computed solid mass fluxes and volume fractions agree with Manyele et al. [S.V.

Unfortunately, such porous carbon materials with multiple synergistic effects are difficult to be achieved simultaneously by conventional synthesis methods in few steps. Herein, we report a series of micro-dominant hierarchical porous carbon with rich heteroatom doping amounts derived by hypercrosslinked polymerization approach for high-performance supercapacitors. Among them, the N/S co-doped porous carbon (N, S-MC) exhibits a micro-dominant (77.5\%) hierarchical porous structure, a large surface area (1339\,m2\,g−1), and rich heteroatom doping amount (4.5\% for N, 5.8\% for S). Remarkably, the N, S-MC (symmetric capacitors in two-electrode system) delivers a specific capacitance as high as 464\,F\,g−1 at 0.2\,A\,g−1, hence a high energy density of 16.2\,W\,h\,kg−1 at 50\,W\,kg−1. Meanwhile, the capacitance retention of N, S-MC remains over 92\% after 10,000 cycles. This work reports a hypercrosslinked polymerization approach to construct hierarchical porous N, S co-doped carbon for high-performance supercapacitor device, which is look forward to provide a new strategy to prepare carbon-based materials for ultrafast electron/ion transport supercapacitors.},

	abstract     = {To deeply understand the particle dispersion and examine the reliability of large eddy simulation (LES) method in two-dimensional gas–solid free shear flows, a particle-laden plane wake flow was numerically investigated. The gas-phase field was solved by using large eddy simulation method, and the particle trajectories were traced in Lagrangian framework based on one-way coupling. The coherent structures and particle dispersion were simulated and compared with previous experiment results. The typical coherent structures alternately forming from the near-wall region, shedding and moving towards the downstream positions were observed. Due to the effects of the coherent structures, the particles demonstrate a more organized dispersion process in the space and a periodic dispersion characteristic in the time. However, for particles at different Stokes numbers, the dispersion patterns are different. Although the particles at smaller Stokes number congregate mainly in the vortex core regions and the particles at larger Stokes number assemble in the vortex braid regions, the particles at intermediate Stokes numbers concentrate highly in the boundary regions of the coherent structures. The two-phase flow characteristics obtained by the present large eddy simulation are in quantitative agreement with previous experiment results.},

The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

	abstract     = {For combustion with CO2 capture, chemical-looping combustion has the advantage that no energy is lost for the separation of CO2. In chemical-looping combustion oxygen is transferred from the combustion air to the gaseous fuel by means of an oxygen carrier. The fuel and the combustion air are never mixed, and the gases from the oxidation of the fuel, CO2 and H2O, leave the system as a separate stream. The H2O can easily be removed by condensation and pure CO2 is obtained without any loss of energy for separation. This makes chemical-looping combustion a most interesting alternative to other CO2 separation schemes, which have the drawback of a large energy consumption. A design of a boiler with chemical-looping combustion is proposed. The system involves two interconnected uidized beds, a high-velocity riser and a low-velocity bed. Metal oxide particles are used as oxygen carrier. The reactivities needed for oxygen carriers to be suitable for such a process are estimated and compared to available experimental data for particles of Fe2O3 and NiO. The data available on oxygen carriers, although limited, indicate that the process outlined should be feasible. ? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The dynamic model is general enough that it can treat a wide range of catalytic systems, subject to mass and energy balances within the phases. The model represents multiple phases and regions (low-density phase, high-density phase, freeboard region) and can account for heat and mass axial and radial anisotropic dispersion, change in molar/volumetric flow due to reaction, temperature and pressure profiles, hydrodynamic regime variation, catalyst deactivation, energy options, and multiple membranes of various geometries for introduction/extraction of any compound. The model reduces, as special cases, to most fluidized bed reactor models reported in the literature, allowing the influence of simplifying assumptions to be investigated. Introduction of different assumptions for a MA fluidized-bed reactor of industrial scale reveal quite different predicted time scales for key dynamic phenomena inherent to the process. A mass transfer/reaction time scale was found to be close to the residence time of the gas molecules in the reactor. The heat transfer time scale is several orders of magnitude larger for the current system. This type of time-scale analysis may be a useful tool to identify the appropriate degree of sophistication to predict the dynamics of complex reacting systems.},

	abstract     = {Sulforaphane (SFN) is an isothiocyanate occurring in broccoli, with exceptional health-beneficial properties, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertensive effects. Processes to maximize SFN content in broccoli developed until now are expensive and SFN bioavailability in the vegetable is not optimal. To increase SFN extraction yield from broccoli florets, it was proposed to complement traditional solvent extraction with pulsed electric field (PEF) as tissue disruption method enabling the reduction of mass transfer resistance in vegetable matrices. Tissue disruption methods enhance the performance of this process because it reduces mass transfer resistance. PEF is an innovative technology recently introduced in the food industry. We studied the effect of electric field strength (10 and 15 kV/cm) and time of exposure to the PEF treatment (30, 90, and 150 s) on the recovery of SFN from broccoli florets, using a statistical factorial design. Electric field strength and exposure time significantly affected SFN recovery in a positive way. PEFs increase SFN recovery by more than 50\% compared to traditional extraction. This result was achieved at 150 s exposure to PEF and 10 kV/cm. Practical Applications The use of pulsed electric fields significantly improved sulforaphane recovery from broccoli in comparison with traditional extraction methods. Even though in this work the raw material was commercial broccoli heads, it is most likely that the results obtained here can be replicated using low-value raw material, such as broccoli heads that do not meet commercial standards or crop discards. Accordingly, PEF technology constitutes an option for valorization of Brassicaceae agroindustry discards.},

Two beds of di erent particle size distribution belonging to group B and group B/D powders were uidized in air in a 13:8 cm diameter column. The drag force on a particle has been calculated based on the measurement of particle velocity and concentration during pulse gas tests, using twin-plane electrical capacitance tomography. The validity of the voidage function “correction function”, (1 − s)n, for the reliable estimation of the e ective drag force has been investigated. The parameter n shows substantial dependence on the relative particle Reynolds number (Rep∗), and the spatial variation of the e ective static and hydrodynamic forces. It is also illustrated that, a simple correlation for the e ective drag coe cient as function of the particle Reynolds number (Rep), expressed implicitly in terms of the interstitial gas velocity, can serve in estimating the e ective drag force in a real uidization process. Analysis shows that, the calculated drag force is comparable to the particle weight, which enables a better understanding of the particle dynamics, and the degree of spatial segregation in a multi-sized particle bed mixture. The analogy presented in this paper could be extended to obtain a generalized correlation for the e ective drag coe cient in a uidized bed in terms of Rep and the particle physical properties.},

A comparative analysis of the hydrodynamic features (solid distribution, bubble shape and bed expansion) extracted from the ECT measurement and the prediction of the MFIX simulation code is presented. For a fluidised bed of group B particles, the code does not provide an accurate prediction of bubble shape and bed expansion at the intermediate to high gas velocity range. For cohesive particles such as group A/B, the code shows considerable overexpansion. This deficiency was mainly attributed to the fact that the MFIX code does not take into account the realistic existence of interparticle cohesion or frictional forces at the intermediate-dense flow regime. Accordingly, proposed interparticle cohesion and frictional shear stress terms have been incorporated, and tested in a two-fluid kinetic theory model to investigate their effect on the general hydrodynamic features of fully developed vertical duct flow. The results show that incorporating both terms in the classic kinetic theory model results in an improvement of the gas–solid distribution and a lowering of the solid carryover, which implies a reduced bed expansion in the freely bubbling column.},

The gas velocities ranged from 5.5 to 10 m/s and solids circulation rate between 100 and 550 kg/m2 s. Sensitivity analysis was first conducted to establish the optimum settings for determining cluster parameters. Aggregate properties (frequency, time fraction, existence time, average solids concentration and cluster vertical dimension) were established using transient solids concentration data, based on the results of the sensitivity analysis.

The solids mixture consists of two solids, one with components of CaO and CaSO4, and the other being an activated carbon. The gas mixture is composed of fine particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide, mercury vapor, oxygen and inert gas. Source terms representing fine particulate matter agglomeration onto sorbent particles, sulfur dioxide removal through chemical adsorption onto calcined lime, and mercury vapor removal through physical adsorption onto activated carbon are formulated and included into the model.

	abstract     = {A literature survey shows that there are two approaches to mathematically describe gas–solid two-phase flow and reaction in the fluidized bed reactors. One approach is a very simplistic engineering reactor model, and the other approach is based on a rigorous Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model. Despite significant progress on numerical methods, CPU capacity and performance, and theories describing gas–solid flow, CFD based reacting flow modeling is far from being a routine tool for designing new reactors. Thus, simpler reactor models are still the main method for providing guidance for fluidized bed reactor design and optimization. However, traditional reactor models have considered too many simplifying assumptions that create inconsistencies in the governing equations of the boundary conditions such that it can result in erroneous prediction. In the current paper, an advanced gas–solid two-phase engineering reactor model has been developed for flow, heat transfer and reaction in the riser reactor of a circulating fluidized bed system. In contrast to CFD, this model can use as input parameters the hydrodynamic information obtained from published literature or experimental measurement such as axial and radial profiles for solid volume fraction, gas velocity and gas dispersion coefficient. While the hydrodynamics can be as accurate as measured, this advanced engineering reactor model is also coupled with either simple power law or the most rigorous kinetic models that involve elementary reactions. In this way, we can extract heterogeneous reaction kinetics from pilot plant or production reactor data directly. Model validation with pilot plant data and tracer data for a riser reactor will be presented and the short falls of traditional treatment of engineering fluidized bed reactor models will also be discussed.},

	abstract     = {Gas and solid hydrodynamics have been studied in dilute circulating fluidized beds under conditions occurring in catalytic cracking risers. Gas radial velocity profiles and dispersions were established by a tracer technique in a cold set-up. The gas axial dispersion was determined in an industrial riser. The local concentrations of the solid phase were measured by a tomographic technique. This has allowed an assessment of the core-annulus structure of the bed and an estimate of the solid radial and axial dispersions. The axial solid concentration profiles were determined in pilot and industrial scale beds. These show an important accumulation upstream of the abrupt exit. The overall conclusion is that the gas flow can be considered to be plug flow with a radial velocity profile and a radial dispersion; the solid flow is slightly more dispersed due to the core-annulus structure and a high radial mixing.},

	abstract     = {A new general method for assessing dispersion within a system is proposed, using trajectory data to define a localised sample of locations, and analysis of the variance in location of that sample after a given period of time. A short-time period allows the dispersion to be related to the local conditions within a system, indicating areas of high and low dispersion. No assumption is made as to the cause of the dispersion. This information, combined with probability data, can give an indication of the effectiveness of the whole system for dispersion. Variation in the time allowed between the initial state and the assessment of the variance shows how material is dispersed within a system over time, allowing phenomena occurring at different scales to be investigated using data obtained in a single experiment. This approach has been applied to data obtained from positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) experiments on several systems, chiefly a small bladed solids mixer. Measurements of dispersion were made as a function of both position and time. In the case of the bladed mixer, it was also found that the region of the machine making the largest contribution to dispersion was the entrance to the freeboard, although dispersion within the bulk region became more important at higher speeds. Mixing times were compared between this mixer, a high shear mixer/granulator, and a fluidised bed, demonstrating that this method can also be used to assess the time taken to mix to a given requirement in a wide range of possible mixer types. An estimate of the dispersion expected at infinite time was made, and seen to agree reasonably well with the observed values.},

A comparison between the two methods has been performed. The main focus of this study was an experimental LDA investigation of ZrO2 particles and glass beads. The particles have approximately the same particle size distribution but different densities. The superficial gas velocity and the particle loading have also been varied in the experiments. The effects of superficial gas velocity, particle loading, and particle density on the particle mean velocities, particle u-rms, particle v-rms, and particle cross-moment were investigated. From the experimental investigation it was found that the axial particle velocities showed a dependence on the particle volume fraction for the ZrO2 particles. It was also observed that the axial fluctuations decreased for both glass and ZrO2 particles when the particle volume fraction increased. The axial fluctuations measured for the glass beads were higher than the fluctuations measured for the ZrO2 particles. The mean axial particle velocity measured by LDA and PIV showed good agreement.},

Conversely, these values can be calculated from the electric current using a special technique; i.e., two short pipes that are made of different materials are installed in series with electrical isolation. The principle of the calculation is based on the contact charging between different materials and the charge balance in the system; the simultaneous equations can be solved analytically.

	pages        = 6,
	abstract     = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a new combustion technology with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO2. The technique involves the use of a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier, which transfers oxygen from the combustion air to the fuel, and hence the direct contact between fuel and combustion air is avoided. Subsequently, the products from combustion, e.g. carbon dioxide and water, will be kept separate from the rest of the flue gases, e.g. nitrogen and any remaining oxygen. Two reactors in the form of interconnected fluidized beds are used in the process: i) a fuel reactor where the metal oxide is reduced by reaction with the fuel, and ii) an air reactor where the reduced metal oxide from the fuel reactor is oxidized with air. The outlet gas from the fuel reactor consists of CO2 and H2O while the outlet gas stream from the air reactor contains only N2 and some unused O2. The net chemical reaction over the two reactors is the same as normal combustion with the same amount of heat released, but with the important difference that carbon dioxide is inherently separated from nitrogen, and no extra energy is needed for this separation. This is in contrast to known techniques for separating carbon dioxide from flue gas, where large amounts of energy and expensive equipment are necessary for carrying out this separation. In this paper the thermodynamic feasibility of using several different metal oxides as oxygen carriers in CLC is discussed. Reactivity data for a few different types of iron oxide particles with methane and air is presented and discussed with respect to use in a CLC system based on interconnected fluidized beds. The rates of reaction obtained for all of the samples are sufficient to be used as oxygen carriers in a CLC system based on interconnected fluidized beds.},

A thermodynamic analysis with CH4 as fuel showed that the yield of CH4 to CO2 and H2O was between 97.7 and 99.8\% in the temperature range 700–1200 8C, with the yield decreasing as the temperature increases. Carbon deposition is not expected as long as sufficient metal oxide is supplied to the fuel reactor. Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, in the fuel gas will be converted partially to SO2 in the gas phase, with the degree of conversion increasing with temperature, but decreasing as a function of pressure. There is the possibility of sulfide formation as Ni3S2 at higher partial pressures of H2SCSO2 in the reactor. The reactivity of freeze granulated particles of NiO with NiAl2O4, MgAl2O4, TiO2 and ZrO2 sintered at different temperatures was investigated in a small fluidized bed reactor by exposing them cyclically to 50\% CH4/50\% H2O and 5\% O2 at 950 8C. During the reducing period, the NiO initially reacted with the CH4 to form CO2 and H2O. However, there were always minor amounts of CO from the outlet of the reactor even at high concentrations of CO2, which was due to the thermodynamic limitations. Here, the ratio CO/(CO2CCOCCH4) was between 1.5 and 2.5\% at 950 8C for the oxygen carriers with alumina based inert. A small amount of CH4 was released from the reactor at high degrees of oxidation of the NiAl2O4 and MgAl2O4-based carriers. As the time under reducing conditions increased, steam reforming of CH4 to CO and H2 became considerable, with Ni catalyzing this reaction. Whereas the ZrO2 particles showed similar behavior as the alumina-based carriers, the TiO2-based particles showed a markedly different reaction behavior, likely due to the complex interaction between NiO and TiO2.},

Since 1956, this text has been the most comprehensive of the introductory, undergraduate, chemical engineering titles available. Separate chapters are devoted to each of the principle unit operations, grouped into four sections: fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer and equilibrium stages, and operations involving particulate solids.  Now in its seventh edition, the text still contains its balanced treatment of theory and engineering practice, with many practical, illustrative examples included. Almost 30\% of the problems have been revised or are new, some of which cover modern topics such as food processing and biotechnology. Other unique topics of this text include diafiltration, adsorption and membrane operations.},

As the demands of these industries for greater efficiency increases and to comply with environmental regulations there is a need for a more fundamental understanding of the behavior of materials in pneumatic conveying systems. The approach presented in this article is to develop a model of a section of pneumatic conveying line, a horizontal or vertical 90  bend, in the commercial CFD software package FLUENT and to describe the multiphase flow behavior by the mixture or Eulerian method. Models of this type have been used in the past to show qualitative and quantitative agreement between model and experiment. The model results presented were compared with experimental data gathered from an industrial-scale pneumatic conveying test system. Broad qualitative agreement in trends and flow patterns were found. Quantitative comparisons were less uniform, with predictions from around 10\% to 90\% different from experimental results, depending on conveying conditions and bend orientation.},

The coefficient of restitution depends on the impact velocity between particles by taking into account both the viscoelastic and plastic deformations of particles, occurring at low and high velocities respectively. Use of this model of restitution coefficient leads to new unexpected behaviors. When the number of particles N is large, a loose cluster appears near the fixed wall, opposite the vibrating wall. The pressure exerted on the walls becomes independent of N, and linear in the vibration velocity V, quite as the granular temperature. The collision frequency at the vibrating wall becomes independent of both N and V, whereas at the fixed wall, it is linear in both N and V. These behaviors arise because the velocity-dependent restitution coefficient introduces a new time scale related to the collision velocity near the cross over from viscoelastic to plastic deformation.},

	abstract     = {This paper derives predictive reduced-order models for rocket engine combustion dynamics via Operator Inference, a scientific machine learning approach that blends data-driven learning with physics-based modelling. The non-intrusive nature of the approach enables variable transformations that expose system structure. The specific contribution of this paper is to advance the formulation robustness and algorithmic scalability of the Operator Inference approach. Regularisation is introduced to the formulation to avoid over-fitting. The task of determining an optimal regularisation is posed as an optimisation problem that balances training error and stability of long-time integration dynamics. A scalable algorithm and open-source implementation are presented, then demonstrated for a single-injector rocket combustion example. This example exhibits rich dynamics that are difficult to capture with state-of-the-art reduced models. With appropriate regularisation and an informed selection of learning variables, the reduced-order models exhibit high accuracy in re-predicting the training regime and acceptable accuracy in predicting future dynamics, while achieving close to a million times speedup in computational cost. When compared to a state-of-the-art model reduction method, the Operator Inference models provide the same or better accuracy at approximately one thousandth of the computational cost.},

	abstract     = {Flow regime study was conducted in a 0.3 m diameter, 15.5 m height circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser with an abrupt exit at the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U. S. Department of Energy. Local particle velocities were measured at various radial positions and riser heights using an optical fiber probe. On-line measurement of solid circulating rate was continuously recorded by measuring the rotational speed of a twisted spiral vane located in the packed bed region of the standpipe.. Glass beads of mean diameter 61 m and particle density of 2,500 kg/m3 were used as bed material. The CFB riser was operated at various superficial gas velocities ranging from 3 to 7.6 m/s and solid mass flux from 20 to 550 kg/m2-s. At a constant riser gas velocity, transition from fast fluidization to dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime started at the bottom of the riser with increasing solid flux. Except at comparatively low riser gas velocity and solid flux, the apparent solid holdup at the top exit region was higher than the middle section of the riser. The solid fraction at this top region could be much higher than 7\% under high riser gas velocity and solid mass flux. The local particle velocity showed downward flow near the wall at the top of the riser due to its abrupt exit. This abrupt geometry reflected the solids and, therefore, caused solid particles traveling downward along the wall. However, at location below, but near, the top of the riser the local particle velocities were observed flowing upward at the wall. Therefore, DSU was identified in the upper region of the riser with an abrupt exit while the fully developed region, lower in the riser, was still exhibiting core-annular flow structure. Our data were compared with the flow regime boundaries proposed by Kim et al. [1] for distinguishing the dilute pneumatic transport, fast fluidization, and DSU.},

The potential value of the waste orange peel has stimulated the search for extraction processes, alternative or complementary to landfilling or to the integral energy conversion. This study introduces controlled hydrodynamic cavitation as a new route to the integral valorization of this by-product, based on simple equipment, speed, effectiveness and efficiency, scalability, and compliance with green extraction principles. Waste orange peel, in batches of several kg, was processed in more than 100 L of water, without any other raw materials, in a device comprising a Venturi-shaped cavitation reactor. The extractions of pectin (with a remarkably low degree of esterification), polyphenols (flavanones and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives), and terpenes (mainly d-limonene) were effective and efficient (high yields within a few min of process time). The biomethane generation potential of the process residues was determined. The achieved results proved the viability of the proposed route to the integral valorization of waste orange peel, though wide margins exist for further improvements.},

	abstract     = {Cavitation is one of the most important aspects of the stable and safe operation of a centrifugal pump. To examine the dynamics of cavitation vortex in a centrifugal pump, the cavitating flow is investigated by using the modified shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model with the Zwart cavitation model. The numerical results are confirmed by comparing them with those obtained from experimental tests. The results show that there is a critical cavitation number of σc at each flow rate condition. As the cavitation number σ exceeds σc, the pump head remains stable. Conversely, the head rapidly decreases when the σ falls below σc. As the σ decreases, the pump experiences successively incipient cavitation, slight cavitation, and severe cavitation. At the stage of severe cavitation conditions, the vortex structures are generated at the tail of cavitation in the flow passage. The vorticity transport method is employed to analyze the vortex dynamics, and it is found that the vortex area contains high vorticity. The dominant contribution to the generation of vorticity comes from the vortex stretching and dilation terms acting in different directions. The contribution of the baroclinic torque to vorticity generation at the vapor-liquid interface is significant. The Coriolis force has a negligible impact on vorticity transport.},

Any complex shape which is not possible by convention fabrication technique can be fabricated using this technique. Moreover, this technique allow the innovator to develop the prototype much faster than the convention method. The complex shape prototype that chosen in this work is the radial flow centrifugal pump and it is the most common and widely used kinetic energy pump. The digital model of the centrifugal pump was prepared using the solidworks. The different component of the centrifugal pump like impeller, casing, suction and shaft also modeled and assembled. The design details of the impeller of the pump and casing is arrived after careful design calculation and it is prepared in such a way to have more efficiency of converting energy in the impeller. The impeller blades, shape, number of blades are arrived based on the total head and discharge. These impeller, suction, casing and shaft all are fabricated by using the FDM of 3D printer using ABS Plastic. The design plays a major role in preparing the centrifugal pump impeller and other components. The fabricated component should be matched accurately while assembly. Moreover, the components fabricated using the rapid prototyping solve the purpose when compare to the other conventional methods. Moreover this FDM technique is successfully benefited in manufacturing light weight prototype, tooling and creating customized design. However, the quality of prototype developed through this technique is relatively lower than the other formative or subtractive technique. This challenges in this technique is addressed by analyzing the microscopic structure of the ABS plastic and presented in this paper.},

	abstract     = {A mathematical model is presented for particle-to-particle heat transfer in gas–solid systems. In developing the model, simple kinetic equations are assumed to describe the inter-particle heat transfer process, and the particle–particle interactions are considered stochastic. A stochastic approach is used to derive the population balance equation describing the variation of the density function of temperature distribution of the particulate phase. The moment equations and numerical solution of the partial integro-differential equation of the population balance model are derived and used to analyse the behaviour of a batch gas–solid system. The results indicate that the population balance approach, used for developing the model describing the inter-particle contact heat conduction during collision capable to take into account a number of parameters affecting the process, can be applied also for predicting heat transfer in gas–solid processing systems.},

As sources of phytochemicals showing biological effects on human health, including anti-cancer properties, pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruits were processed using HC. Fractions collected during the process (M1-M5) were lyophilized (L), filtered (A), or used as such (C), for identifying their best conservation practice. Biochemical profile and in vitro antioxidant power were investi-gated by spectrophotometric and chromatographic assays. The antiproliferative effect of L-M3, resulting from just 15 minutes of extraction, was tested on human breast cancer line (AU565-PAR) and peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) cells from healthy donors. M3-M4 fractions from L and C series revealed the highest antiradical activity and phenolic content. Cell growth, death, and redox state were assessed, showing that the pomegranate extract M3 significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation and intracellular oxygen reactive species. No effect on PBMCs was de-tected. Thus, the use of antioxidants isolated using HC as adjuvants in anticancer therapies might be advantageous and affordable; moreover, since oxidative stress contributes to cancer devel-opment, its reduction might be the leading mechanism.},

The two-phase intermolecular potential model was utilized to investigate the microscopic behavior of the electrolyte flow in the porous electrodes. The results showed that embedding microchannels inside the electrodes significantly improves the wettability of the electrodes, especially for the electrodes with lower porosities. Furthermore, the use of microchannels inside the electrodes could considerably reduce possibility of occurrence of the thermal runaway. During thermal runaway, the electrodes with higher number of smaller microchannels could drive the generated gases out of the battery cell much quicker than the electrodes with lower number of larger microchannels.},

In this study, a transient method was applied which readily allows one to identify operational features and critical transitions. The method is based on stopping the solids flow rate into the riser when riser is operating in fully dense transport regime. The analysis of transient pressure drop data across the riser during a solids flow cut-off experiment against its time derivative demonstrate the three distinct operating regimes that exist as the gas deplete the solid out of the riser. The transient was compared to data taken under steady state operations using statistically designed experiments. Results indicated that although there were significant differences when comparing operations in dilute conditions, there were no significant differences between the two methods in the fast fluidized and dense transport regimes. The transient method was capable of reproducing the solids circulation dependence on riser solids holdup and on the axial pressure profile. This transient method offers an accurate, easy, rapid, and reproducible means of characterizing CFB operations over a wide range of flow conditions. The lack of accuracy in the dilute regime is conjectured to be due to the wide particle size distribution that resulted in segregation during the transient testing.},

A single unambiguous experimental method was developed to identify the transitions between CFB operating regimes. Experiments were conducted at riser gas velocities ranging from dense phase turbulent, through fast fluidization (S-shape riser pressure profile), and up to dilute-phase flow regimes. A transient method was applied to a low density, Geldart Type B, cork bed material. Two distinct transition velocities were found by analyzing the time required to empty out all solids from the riser of the CFB after cutting off solids flow. The lowest transition velocity marked the transition between the dense-phase turbulent and the fast fluidization flow regimes, while a higher or second transition represented the transition between the fast fluidization and the dilute-phase flow regimes. Based on the experimental results, the axial pressures and its fluctuations along the riser exhibited markedly distinct profiles in each of the three different operating flow regime regions as defined by these two transport velocities.},

	abstract     = {A mathematical model was developed to describe the sulfidation of zinc oxide sorbents in a transport reactor. The model incorporated both kinetic and hydrodynamic effects. A variable property grain model was applied to account for the kinetic reaction of hydrogen sulfide with zinc oxide. Grain radius was assumed to vary under the combined effect of sintering and extend of reaction. All model parameters were obtained from literature correlations or independent experimental measurements. The model predictions were validated against experimental data from a bench-scale transport reactor. Tests were conducted with 70 m ZnO particles in a nitrogen stream with 1\% H2S at 2100 kPa and 811 K. The sorbent was recycled through the system to simulate 10 passes through the reactor. Significant improvement in the comparison with experimental results was achieved when compared to a constant property grain model. The model was also used to perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of operating temperature, pressure, H2S concentration, and particle size on the hot gas desulfurization performance.},

Inside a circulating uidized bed a single cluster has a signiÿcant e ect on the gas that ows around it. Recent experiments have suggested that large scale gas uctuations occur as the air ows around the cluster body. This paper examines the e ect a single cluster has on the surrounding gas ow. Experimental work focuses on a small riser with the ability to release a single cluster. A specially designed probe measures the gas velocity as the cluster travels by. Numerical work simulates the e ect of air ow around a porous body. The uctuation levels observed are comparable to the experiments. Both results show that large scale velocity uctuations occur in the gas in the vicinity of a cluster. This has a large impact on gas and particle modeling and mixing inside a circulating uidized bed.},

MWCNTs have been produced very selectively on the multi-gram scale by catalytic chemical vapor deposition from ethylene in a fluidized bed reactor. The kinetics of MWCNTs growth is fast and, with the catalyst used, no induction period has been observed. The kinetic law is of positive order in ethylene concentration and the process is limited by internal diffusion in the porosity of the catalyst. The formation of MWCNTs in the macroporosity of the catalyst induces an explosion of the catalyst grains. Such a process, thanks to the absence of temperature gradient and to the efficient mixing of the grains allows a uniform and selective treatment of the catalyst powder leading to very high selectivity towards MWCNTs formation. High purity MWCNTs have been obtained after catalyst dissolution. Depending on the temperature of production, the specific surface area of this material ranged between 95 and 455 m2/g.},

The gas was air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and the solids were 385 mm sand or 70 mm FCC particles. The experiments were done at superficial gas velocities from 0.5 to 2.8 mrs for sand and 0.44 to 0.9 mrs for FCC Žin both bubbling and turbulent regimes.. Movement of a tracer was monitored by radioactive particle tracking ŽRPT. technique. Once the time-position data became available, local axial and radial diffusivity of solids were calculated from these data. Calculated diffusivities are in the range of 3.3 = 10y3 to 5.6 = 10y2 m2rs for axial and 2.6 = 10y4 to 1.5 = 10y3 m2rs for radial direction. The results show that the diffusivities, both axial and radial, increase with superficial gas velocity and are linearly correlated to the axial solid velocity gradient. Solid diffusivity in a bed of FCC was found to be higher than that of a bed of sand at the same excess superficial gas velocity. q 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

This work assesses the commercialization potential of Bio-CNG production from sugarcane bagasse by performing a detailed techno-economic and life cycle assessment (LCA). The process under consideration uses hydrodynamic cavitation as pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion based bagasse valorization and biogas upgradation using water scrubbing. Experimental data for cavitation and anaerobic digestion are combined with process simulation data for upgradation and compression. Process design and economics methods are used to perform techno-economic assessment (TEA) for plants producing 5 and 10 TPD Bio-CNG. For LCA, 1~kg of Bio-CNG is used as a functional unit. Inventory data were obtained from experiments, process simulation, and Ecoinvent® database v 3.3. The Bio-CNG production cost for a 5 TPD plant was \$ 1.29 /kg (₹ 96/kg) which decreased to \$ 1.18/kg (₹ 87/kg) for a 10 TPD plant. For a 5 TPD plant, the production cost could potentially reduce to \$ 0.51 /kg (₹ 37/kg) if bagasse and electricity were available for free. The total climate change impact for 1~kg of Bio-CNG was 1.55~kg CO2 eq., and the electricity source significantly contributed to the total impact. Considering the source of CNG used in the transport sector in India, Bio-CNG provided a net benefit (reduction) of 3.96~kg CO2 eq. per kg Bio-CNG.},

	abstract     = {In this paper a computational analysis of the dynamic vortex-cavitation flow observed on the so-called twist-11 Delft hydrofoil (Foeth 2008) is presented. Flow calculations are performed using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) as well as Improved Delayed Detached-Eddy simulation (IDDES) models available in the commercial software STAR-CCM+. The flow-field is realized as a continuous mixture of liquid and vapor bubbles, in the context of the Eulerian Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. For predicting growth/collapse oscillations of cavitation bubbles, the multiphase VOF solver is coupled with different cavitation models based on the Rayleigh-Plesset (R-P) equation. Parametric simulations tested include the asymptotic formulation proposed by Sauer (2000) and the classical R-P equation, which also accounts for the inertia of bubbles as well as surfacetension and viscous effects (Brennen 1995). The obtained results are validated against reported experimental measurements in terms of the lift force and the vortex shedding frequency. In addition, model predictions are also compared against equivalent Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations reported in the literature (Hoekstra et al 2011, Bensow 2011). The evaluation of the predicted results suggests that inertial effects of cavitating bubbles have a major impact on the transient characteristics of multiscale vortex cavitation flows.},

A continuum model has been developed taking into account the mass and energy balances of solid, gas as well as liquid to describe the temperature and concentration distributions in gas–solid-fluidized beds. The model considers the deposition efficiency of the liquid droplets as well as the influence of the spray nozzle region. For solving the non-linear partial differential equations with discrete boundary conditions a finite element method is used. Numerical computations have been done with two different schemes of time integration, a fully implicit and a semi implicit scheme. The complex correlations of mass and liquid flow rates, mass and heat transfer, drying, and transient two-dimensional air humidity, air temperature, particle wetting, liquid film temperature and particle temperature were simulated. The model was validated with transient measurements of the air temperature and air humidity at the outlet of a fluidized bed with water injection.},

A unique method for the LDV signal processing is presented that takes the advantage of the sinusoidal oscillation of the particle at a known frequency.

This component is naturally present in the broccoli sprouts, kale, cabbage, cauliflower and garden cress and is available as a commercial supplementary pill called Broccoli extract. Availability of many bioactive substances such as vitamins, polyphenols, sulfides, glucosinolates and antioxidants makes broccoli consumption important in daily diet regularly.

This work attempts to understand and investigate the influence of formation of such clusters on effective drag between gas and solid phases using the energy minimization multi scale (EMMS) model. Unlike previous works on EMMS, the model is investigated outside the CFD domain and predictions were compared with the experimental data for risers and downers. The predicted drag coefficient from the EMMS approach was evaluated for its sensitivity with respect to model parameters. Though overall picture postulated in EMMS looks promising, the critical examination of EMMS for simulating gas solid flows reveal some limitations of the EMMS model. The minimum energy consumption was obtained at lowest possible of cluster voidage, arbitrarily assumed in the model simulation. The cluster voidage significantly affected the predicted drag coefficient. Possible ways to minimize or eliminate some of the limitations were also discussed. The results presented in this work will provide a useful basis for further improvements in the EMMS framework and for further work on gas –solid flows.},

The steady-state equations of conservation of mass and momentum were used for the gas-phase, and the effect of turbulence on the flow-field was included via the standard k–e model. The particle equation of motion included the drag, the Saffman lift and the gravity forces. Turbulence dispersion effect on the particles was simulated as a continuous Gaussian random field. The effects of particles on the flow were modeled by appropriate source terms in the momentum, k and e equations. Particle–particle collisions and particle–wall collisions were accounted for in these simulations. Gas-phase velocities and turbulence kinetic energy in the presence of 2–100\% mass loadings of two particle classes (50 lm glass and 70 lm copper) were evaluated, and the results were compared with the available experimental data and earlier numerical results. The simulation results showed that when the inter-particle collisions were important and was included in the computational model, the fluid turbulence was attenuated. The level of turbulence attenuation increased with particle mass loading, particle Stokes number, and the distance from the wall. When the inter-particle collisions were negligible and/or was neglected in the model, the fluid turbulence was augmented for the range of particle sizes considered.},

	abstract     = {Vaporization and cracking of liquid oil injected in a gas–solid riser (fluid catalytic cracking riser reactor) was computationally studied in this work. Evaporation of a single drop injected in a stream of gas–solid mixture was analyzed first. A model for simulating evaporation of a drop considering heat transfer from the gas phase as well as from the solid particles was developed. The model relates the evaporation rate of droplet with rate of collisions of solid particles, specific heat capacities of solid and liquid, latent heat of vaporization, relative velocity of gas and liquid and temperatures of three phases. The understanding gained from such a model was then extended to simulate evaporation of liquid drops injected in FCC risers. The Eulerian–Lagrangian approach was used to simulate simultaneous evaporation and cracking reactions occurring in FCC riser reactors. A commercial CFD code, FLUENT (of Fluent Inc., USA) was used. Four and ten lump models were used for simulating cracking reactions. Appropriate user defined functions were developed to implement heterogeneous kinetics and heat transfer models in FLUENT. A special algorithm was developed to calculate accumulated coke on catalyst particles. A boiling point range was considered for simulating realistic oil feedstock. The model was first evaluated by comparing predicted results with published industrial data. The simulations were then carried out to understand influence of key design and operating parameters on performance of FCC riser reactors. The parameters studied included; initial oil droplet distribution, catalyst inlet temperature, catalyst to oil ratio and thermal cracking. The approach, model and results presented here would be useful for optimization of FCC operation, cost to benefit analysis of new FCC nozzles and related decision-making.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents the modeling of a desiccant wheel used for dehumidifying the ventilation air of an air-conditioning system. The simulation of the combined heat and mass transfer processes that occur in a solid desiccant wheel is carried out with MATLAB Simulink. Using the numerical method, the performance of an adiabatic rotary dehumidifier is parametrically studied, and the optimal rotational speed is determined by examining the outlet adsorption-side humidity profiles. The solutions of the simulation at different conditions used in air dehumidifier have been investigated according to the previous published studies. The model is validated through comparison the simulated results with the published actual values of an experimental work. This method is useful to study and modelling of solid desiccant dehumidification and cooling system. The modeling solutions are used to develop simple correlations for the outlet air conditions of humidity and temperature of air through the wheel as a function of the physically measurable input variables. These correlations will be used to simulate the desiccant cooling cycle in an HVAC system in order to define the year round efficiency.},

The amplitude and frequency distribution of pressure fluctuations measured in both beds agree closely when these parameters are appropriately nondimensionalized. Thus, bubble characteristics of the two beds should be similar. Disagreements are shown to exist when all the nondimensional parameters are not kept equal between the hot bed and cold model. Variations in the particle size distribution and sphericity also cause non-similar behavior. When the hot bed material is used in the cold bed, there are significant disagreements between the behavior of the two beds. 8 references, 13 figures, 5 tables.},

An optical measuring system, based on detection of light reflected by the suspended particles, has been developed to measure local solids concentration and local axial solids velocity in dense gas-solid two phase flows. This system has been applied to study hydrodynamics of a cold-flow circulating fluidized bed unit operated in the dense flow regime (uD: 7.5–15 m s−1 and Gs = 100−400 kg m−2 s−). With increasing solids mass flux, at constant superficial gas velocity, lateral solids segregation became more pronounced (i.e. extent of development of core-annulus structure) while the radial profiles of axial solids velocity hardly changed. A decrease in superficial gas velocity, at constant solids mass flux, also augmented the lateral solids segregation. The axial solids velocity decreased over the entire tube radius, although the shape of the profiles showed no strong dependence with respect to the superficial gas velocity. Average solids mass fluxes calculated from the measured local values of solids concentration and solids velocity exceeded the imposed solids mass flux, a finding which could be explained by the downflow observed visually of solid particles close to the tube wall. In addition, cross-sectional averaged solids concentrations obtained on the basis of the optical measuring system and those obtained from the pressure gradient measurements showed satisfactory agreement.},

The optimization of FCC process is challenging due to the complex interactions between a large number of dependent and independent parameters. One of the most uncertain aspects of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit is the description of fluid-solid mixing at the riser entrance. Most of the existing models assume an instant mixing of solids and gaseous reactants. However, a finite mixing length at the bottom of the riser may have a pronounced effect on the FCC operation, particularly, when very short residence times are allowed in the current commercial FCC risers. A good solid-fluid mixing is essential to ensure a complete feed vaporization which is important for several reasons including assuring a thorough catalyst to oil contact and minimizing coke deposition. In this study, the Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow and the 3-lump kinetic models were used to simulate the hydrodynamics and cracking reactions occurring in the FCC riser reactors. The model demonstrated the capability of commercial CFD code FLUENT 6.2 to describe the flow field in the riser reactor.

For the ozone studies, thermal effects are unimportant; the ozone is only present in small amounts. Also, mixing effects are not addressed since the ozone was premixed with the fluidization air. For methane combustion, the chemical reactions are all in the gas phase although heat transfer to the granular phase is important; again the reactants are premixed in the plenum. For coal gasification, the solids must be mixed with the fluidizing air; many heterogeneous reactions are also included. Complicated chemical schemes are required to describe these processes; the heat release is accounted for, as is the effect on fluidization of gas released by the chemical conversion.},

It provides the standard material in a coherent presentation and uses a notation that is more consistent with the research literature in process control. Topics that are unique include a unified approach to model representations, process model formation and process identification, multivariable control, statistical quality control, and model-based control. This book is designed to be used as an introductory text for undergraduate courses in process dynamics and control. In addition to chemical engineering courses, the text would also be suitable for such courses taught in mechanical, nuclear, industrial, and metallurgical engineering departments. The material is organized so that modern concepts are presented to the student but details of the most advanced material are left to later chapters. The text material has been developed, refined, and classroom tested over the last 10-15 years at the University of Wisconsin and more recently at the University of Delaware. As part of the course at Wisconsin, a laboratory has been developed to allow the students hands-on experience with measurement instruments, real time computers, and experimental process dynamics and control problems.},

Recently, studies have sought information on the collision behavior of fuel droplets for application to combustion spray systems. Researchers have found distinct differences between the collision behavior of water droplets and fuel droplets. The extensive experimental data on the droplet collision process is reviewed and presented here for both water and fuel droplet collisions. Collision outcomes of bounce, temporary coalescence followed by separation or catastrophic fragmentation and permanent coalescence are examined and an effort is made to relate the existing findings to a unified description of collisional droplet behavior.},

The model is implemented in the framework of the computational-particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) numerical methodology, in which the particle phase is represented with computational parcels and the continuous phase is calculated on Eulerian finite-difference grid.

These residues are disposed of on landfills producing environmental issues due to pollutants released into the air, water, and soil. Several research efforts have focused on upgrading FL and FW in a portfolio of added-value products and energy vectors. Among the most relevant research advances, biotechnological upgrading of these residues via fermentation has been demonstrated to be a potential valorization alternative. Despite the multiple investigations performed on the conversion of FL and FW, a lack of comprehensive and systematic literature reviews evaluating the potential of fermentative processes to upgrade different food residues has been identified. Therefore, this article reviews the use of FL and FW in fermentative processes considering the composition, operating conditions, platforms, fermentation product application, and restrictions. This review provides the framework of food residue fermentation based on reported applications, experimental, and theoretical data. Moreover, this review provides future research ideas based on the analyzed information. Thus, potential applications and restrictions of the FL and FW used for fermentative processes are highlighted. In the end, food residues fermentation must be considered a mandatory step toward waste minimization, a circular economy, and the development of more sustainable production and consumption patterns.},

When the density was low enough, the particle moved on the surface of the bubble wake. The drag force of the large particle immersed in a fluidized bed was measured. The drag force increased with an increase in the volumetric gas flux as well as with an increase in the particle diameter.

Different design parameters were checked to validate the stability of the reactor. 8 reactions were taken into consideration for the simulation of gasification. A mixture of pure oxygen, water vapor, and nitrogen entering through the bottom of the distributor was used as the gasifying agent. The coal sample was fed from the side wall of the reactor 20\,cm above the gas distributor. Three Australian coal samples having different compositions were simulated using CFD simulation and results were validated to justify the modeling of the reactor. The effect of the oxygen-to-carbon ratio on coal gasification was studied to get the maximum yield of synthesis gas. The cold gas efficiency of the reactor was found to be within 45–60\% which was agreeing well with the literature data. The carbon conversion was also found to be between 40 and 50\%. The yield of synthesis gas was measured and the mass fraction of outlet gases was calculated through simulation. These results imply that the gasifier modeling is satisfactory. Thus, it can be concluded that the CFD-modeled reactor can be used as a base design for an industrial gasifier.},

To explore the pressure fluctuations, a series of experiments were conducted by monitoring the pressure drop and its fluctuations in horizontal and vertical pipe sections of an experimental conveying rig of industrial relevance. Observed pressure signals contained not only the effects of flow rates of conveyed polymeric solid particles and the conveying air, but also the effects of the pipe orientation, solids feeder, and the air blower employed. Time series of the observed pressure signals were analyzed in order to obtain information about the relations based on four different analysis techniques: power spectral density (PSD) analysis, phase space diagram, rescaled range analysis, and wavelet analysis. The sampling frequency of the study was determined through the application of the PSD analysis. Variations in gas and particle flow rates were found that could be traced by the locations of the dominant peaks on the frequency axis of spectrum plots generated from the PSD analysis. Additionally, the level of multiplicity of such dominant PSD peaks pointed to the differences in the flow behavior between the interconnected vertical and horizontal pipe sections. Variations in the Hurst’s exponent of the rescaled range analysis technique with the solids loading ratios were found relatable to the observed flow regimes prevailing in the pneumatic conveying system studied. Eccentricity ratios and the number of attractors of the phase space diagrams provided further information about the effects of the changes in solids loading ratios on the flow behavior and the flow mode, respectively. The wavelet analysis, through its detailed signals at different scale levels, helped to give information from the pressure fluctuations. Unique frequencies were determined that corresponded to certain flow behaviors and devices, gas-particle interactions, the mechanical blower, and feeder units. This finding enabled the investigation of the intrinsic flow behavior by filtering out the signals caused by such mechanical devices.},

The feed is either jetsam-rich or flotsam-rich binary mixture of particles of different size, but same density. The variables tested were superficial gas velocity, solids feed rate and feed characteristics. At steady state, there exists physical equilibrium between the evolved flotsam and the residual jetsam when the granular solids are in fluid-like state as in the case of density segregation of solids [1]. Using the analogy of the binary liquid mixtures separation by distillation, the phase diagram was constructed from the experimental observations.

	abstract     = {This paper presents a novel technique for particle tracking in 2-dimensional fluidized beds operated under ambient conditions. The method is applied to study the mixing mechanisms of fuel particles in fluidized beds and is based on tracking a phosphorescent tracer particle by means of video recording with subsequent digital image analysis. From this, concentration, velocity and dispersion fields of the tracer particle can be obtained with high accuracy. Although the method is restricted to 2-dimensional, it can be applied under flow conditions qualitatively resembling a fluidized-bed combustor. Thus, the experiments cover ranges of bed heights, gas velocities and fuel-to-bed material density and size ratios typical for fluidized-bed combustors. Also, several fluidization regimes (bubbling, turbulent, circulating and pneumatic) are included in the runs. A pattern found in all runs is that the mixing pattern of the tracer (fuel) solids is structured in horizontally aligned vortexes induced by the bubble flow. The main bubble paths always give a low concentration of tracer solids and with the tracer moving upwards, while the downflow of tracer particles in the dense bottom bed is found to take place in zones with low bubble density and at the sidewalls. The amount of bed material (bed height) has a strong influence on the bottom bed dynamics (development and coalescence of bubbles) and, consequently, on the solids mixing process. Local dispersion coefficients reach maximum values around the locations of bubble eruptions, while, in the presence of a dense bottom bed, an increase in fluidization velocity or amount of bed material enhances dispersion. Dispersion is found to be larger in the vertical than in the horizontal direction, confirming the critical character of lateral fuel dispersion in fluidized-bed combustors of large cross section.},

Recently, continuous crystallization was demonstrated to have several advantages over the conventional batch crystallization in terms of improved product consistency, reduced labor costs/economic footprint, and better process control. Continuous stirred tank crystallizers, however, are limited in mixing/heat transfer capabilities and have issues like cyclical oscillations in product quality. Tubular crystallizers can mitigate these issues and, however, suffer from issues related to particle settling and blockages. Fluidic oscillators with one or more feedback channels are gaining popularity in recent years due to the advent of microfluidics. Jet oscillations in fluidic oscillators were shown to consistently provide vigorous mixing and heat transfer above a critical Reynold’s number. In the present study, the feasibility of the fluidic oscillator as a continuous crystallizer was evaluated to mitigate challenges faced by previous continuous crystallization technologies. A novel “loop setup” was proposed for continuous crystallization and was investigated using the seeded antisolvent crystallization of paracetamol in a methanol−water system. The effects of key operating conditions of residence time, supersaturation ratio, operational mode, fluidic device, device orientation, and seed size were investigated. Throughout the study, it was observed that the loop setup gave product particle size distributions consistent with enhanced mixing behavior. Further, it was demonstrated that the proposed continuous crystallizer was better in terms of scale up in comparison with batch crystallizers. The presented results and approach will be useful to develop fluidic oscillators as a useful platform for continuous crystallization.},

Hydrodynamic treatment was compared to various chemical, physical and mechanical stressors such as ionic strength and osmolarity agents (glucose, Na+, Ca2+, and Fe3+), free radicals, shear stresses (pipetting, vortex mixing, rotational shear stress), high pressure, electroporation, centrifugation, surface active agents (Triton X-100, ethanol), microwave irradiation, heating, freezing-thawing, ultrasound (ultrasonic bath, sonotrode). The fluorescence intensity of individual fluorescein loaded lipid vesicles was measured with confocal laser microscopy. The distribution of lipid vesicle size, vesicle fluorescence intensity, and the number of fluorescein loaded vesicles was determined before and after treatment with different stressors. The different environmental stressors were ranked in order of their relative effect on liposome fluorescein release. Of all tested chemical, physical and mechanical treatments for stability of lipid vesicles, the most detrimental effect on vesicles stability had hydrodynamic cavitation, vortex mixing with glass beads and ultrasound. Here we showed, for the first time that hydrodynamic cavitation was among the most effective physico-chemical treatments in destroying lipid vesicles.

A model has also been developed to calculate the heat transfer mixing height in the riser to verify the assumption of instant thermal equilibrium between the feed and the catalyst. The models were incorporated in CATCRAK [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 34 (1995) 3737] and temperature and conversion profiles within the riser were obtained. A temperature drop of about 30–40 ◦C (typical of commercial applications) was predicted.

That could be prevented by increasing the gas velocity, provided an adequate observation of changes in the hydrodynamic of the fluidized bed is detected early enough. Since the value of gas velocity on defluidization of bed is near the gas velocity at minimum fluidization condition, it is very important to use a methodology that can promptly detect the minimum fluidization velocity region, so that shutting down the process can be avoided. The literature shows that the methods to detect the region of such a velocity are limited, and in practice, the traditional method for determination of minimum fluidization velocity (pressure drop across the bed versus superficial gas velocity) is still the most used. In the present work, a methodology is proposed to detect the region where the minimum velocity takes place in a gas–solid fluidized bed, based on the spectral analysis of pressure fluctuation measurements using a Gaussian distribution curve. Results indicate that the method is satisfactory, and it could be used as a more practical indicator of the region where the defluidization phenomenon occurs.},

The lactic acid production and removal was carried out in the downer, while the riser was used for the recovery of lactic acid. A continuously recirculating bed of ion-exchange resin was used for adsorption of the produced acid as well as for maintaining optimum pH for bioconversion, thus eliminating the need for costly and complex chemical control approach used in conventional techniques. Studies using lactic acid aqueous solution as feed and sodium hydroxide solution as regeneration stream showed 93\% lactic acid removal from the downer and 46\% recovery in the riser under the conditions investigated.

It has direct influence on the drying rate, thermal efficiency, residence time distribution and degree of mixing. The quality of fluidization strongly depends on the uniformity of distribution of the fluidizing gas and the physical properties of the material to be fluidized. In the present work, gamma ray tomography (GRT) study was carried out in the form of chordal solid hold-up, which was found to be greatly influenced by the gas distributor design. The performance of a gas distributor due to the prevalent practice of operating at lower values of distributor-to-bed pressure drop ratio was characterized in a 0.15 m diameter fluidized bed dryer over a broad range of superficial gas velocity. The effects of various parameters such as solids loading, particle size and particle density were analyzed with the help of the reconstructed solid hold-up profiles. The fluidization was studied in terms of maldistribution factor (χ), a value of 5\% or less can be obtained by properly designing distributor for a given bed loading, particularly for batch fluidized bed dryers. An industrial size fluidized bed dryer of 1 m diameter was also examined tomographically to obtain quantitative information on the solid hold-up distribution within the bed.},

The impulse experiments show that gas passes through the riser at velocities significantly greater than superficial gas velocities. A core-annular flow model was used to describe the hydrodynamics. Axial dispersion in the core zone is negligible and mass transfer to the denser, stagnant annulus is characterized by a cross-flow coefficient, k. The Gilliland-Sherwood equation for wetted wall towers, modified to account for the increase in mass transfer rate introduced by the solids, correlates the data reasonably well: The ratio of the cross-sectional area of the lean core to riser cross-sectional area, Φg, decreases with solids mass flux but increases with gas velocity. Based on a number of experimental investigations, the effects of riser diameter and particle characteristics on Φg were qualified and the data were fit with a simple two parameter model: This relationship adequately predicts gas bypassing in risers from 0.05 to 0.94 m in diameter.},

Firstly, two closure models, one semi-empirical model assuming a constant viscosity of the solid phase (CVM) and a second model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF), have been compared in this part in their performance to describe bubble formation at a single orifice and the time-averaged porosity profiles in the bed using experimental data obtained for a pseudo two-dimensional fluidized bed operated with a jet in the center. Numerical simulations have shown that bubble growth at a nozzle with a jet is mainly determined by the drag experienced by the gas percolating through the compaction region around the bubble interface, which is not much influenced by particle–particle interactions, so that the KTGF and CVM give very similar predictions. However, this KTGF model does not account for the long term and multi particle–particle contacts (frictional stresses) and under-predicts the solid phase viscosity at the wall as well as around the bubble and therefore over-predicts the bed expansion. Therefore, in the later part of the paper, the bubble growth at a single orifice and the time-averaged porosity distribution in the bed predicted by the KTGF model with and without frictional stresses are compared with experimental data. The model predictions by the KTGF are improved significantly by the incorporation of frictional stresses, which are however strongly influenced by the empirical parameters in this model. In Part II the comparison of the CVM and KTGF with experimental results is extended to freely bubbling fluidized beds.},

The results of the simulations show that two-dimensional simulations should be used with caution and only for sensitivity analysis, whereas three-dimensional simulations are able to reproduce both the statics (bed height and pdf of the spatial distribution of particles) and the dynamics (power spectrum of pressure uctuations) of the bed. The non-sphericity of the particles is accounted for in the models and its in uence on the results is presented. ? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites, making them an area of interest in the search for new phytochemicals to cope with AMR. A great part of agri-food waste is of plant origin, constituting a promising source of valuable compounds with different bioactivities, including those against antimicrobial resistance. Many types of phytochemicals, such as carotenoids, tocopherols, glucosinolates, and phenolic compounds, are widely present in plant by-products, such as citrus peels, tomato waste, and wine pomace. Unveiling these and other bioactive compounds is therefore very relevant and could be an important and sustainable form of agri-food waste valorisation, adding profit for local economies and mitigating the negative impact of these wastes’ decomposition on the environment. This review will focus on the potential of agri-food waste from a plant origin as a source of phytochemicals with antibacterial activity for global health benefits against AMR.},

	abstract     = {The prediction of mass transfer rates to and from moving drops has traditionally used the Whitman two-ÿlm theory approach in which the resistances to mass transfer on each side of the interface are described by ÿlm mass transfer coe cients. These are correlated in terms of the hydrodynamic conditions, the physical properties of the uids, and the geometry of the system. The performance of liquid–liquid contactors in which mass transfer occurs between swarms of moving droplets of one phase and the other liquid phase as the continuous phase, has similarly been correlated in terms of mass transfer coe cients. These lump together the combined e ects of interfacial mass transfer resistances and those associated with the bulk phases, the e ects of interfacial disturbances, coalescence and break-up phenomena, speciÿc surface area, and the e ects of axial mixing. In this paper we build upon earlier work and other published research which uses ÿnite element methods to quantitatively calculate ow ÿeld data and trajectory predictions for single particles and drops in a two phase system. The di erential equations were discretised using the ÿnite element approach employing a procedure based on the Lagrangian framework developed earlier. Here we extend the approach to calculate mass transfer rates between single aqueous drops and a continuous immiscible solvent phase. The calculated values of drop velocity and mass transfer rates are compared with experimental values determined for single drops of ethanol=water mixtures extracting into a continuous phase of n-decanol. Good agreement between the experimental and predicted values was obtained, thus demonstrating that in this case, interfacial mass transfer in liquid–liquid systems can be predicted from the fundamental transport equations. The results of the work indicate the potential of further development of this approach for swarming drops and hence quantitative prediction of the behaviour of liquid–liquid contactors. ? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A pronounced and nonmonotonic variation of the pressure gradient required to achieve desired fluxes of solid and gas with tube diameter was predicted by the model, and this is explained on a physical basis. The computed results were compared with the experimental data. The model manifests an unsatisfactory degree of sensitivity to the inelasticity of the particle-particle collisions and the damping of particle-phase fluctuating motion by the gas.},

In order to achieve food security, all of these wastes can be valorized using downstream processes in an integrated manner, which results in the conversion of waste into secondary raw materials. Specifically, plant-based food wastes and/or byproducts are recognized sources of bioactive chemicals, including dietary fibers that are beneficial as food additives or functional food ingredients that can meet the technological and functional requirements of health-promoting value-added products. Additionally, cellulosic ingredients can be utilized directly within nonfood industries, such as textiles, resulting in a reduction in the environmental impact of secondary raw materials, as well as an increase in market acceptance compared to those currently on the market. On this basis, the present review was designed to provide an overview of introducing novel concepts for effective reuse, recyclability, and maximal utilization of plant-based food wastes and/or byproducts from food-processing industries, which creates a potential opportunity for the extraction of value-added dietary fiber with potential applications in food and nonfood industries.},

Using a two-camera system, instantaneous fluid-phase and particle-phase measurements can be obtained simultaneously. The data obtained with this system are used to study the decay behaviour of the turbulent flow. The role of particle size, particle density and volume load is studied in a number of different cases. These cases are chosen so that the individual role of these parameters can systematically be evaluated. Addition of particles to the flow has significant effects on the decaying turbulence: first, the onset of the turbulent decay appears to shift upstream; second, the flow becomes anisotropic as it develops downstream. The latter is observed as an increase in integral length scale in the vertical direction. The rate at which the flow becomes anisotropic can be predicted using a new parameter: the product of the non-dimensional number density and the Stokes number (referred to as the ‘Stokes load’). This parameter, combining the relevant fluid and particle characteristics, is a measure for the energy redistribution leading to anisotropy. In addition to redistributing energy, the particles also produce turbulence. However, this only becomes evident when the grid-generated turbulence has decayed sufficiently, relatively far downstream of the grid. The turbulence production by particles can also account for the observed decrease in slope of the power spectrum, which leads to a ‘cross-over’ effect. The production of turbulence by the particles can be predicted using a model for the momentum deficit of the particle wakes. The validity of this approach is confirmed using conditional sampling of the fluid velocity field around the particles.},

Effective safety teaching is also dependent on the experience and knowledge of the teaching staff involved and the locational context of the institution. Here, the novel and comprehensive approaches taken to inherently embed safety teaching within a chemical engineering programme, which is part of the wider Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP) teaching framework at UCL’s Faculty of Engineering Sciences, are examined and its success is measured against student perceptions. Students following the IEP chemical engineering degree programme widely recognise that safety teaching is immediately embedded into the curriculum from the first year and they are given increasing opportunities to apply safety learnings throughout their degree. This leads to a feeling of preparedness for their capstone design projects and future industrial roles, ultimately achieving the aim of developing well-rounded, responsible graduate engineers with a strong safety culture embedded in the way they will approach their future work.},

To characterize this new measuring cell, a suitable test system was identified and measurements regarding the separation performance as well as the dry and wet pressure drop were conducted. Furthermore, experiments were carried out with similar boundary conditions in columns of varying diameters (DN 50, DN 80, DN 250). The paper presents a comparison of the results gained to demonstrate the transferability and information value of the new measuring cell in comparison to conventional lab columns. To our knowledge, these are the first investigations evaluating the separation performance of distillation processes in small measuring cells of this kind.},

Gas mixing between the two reactors is prevented by moderately fluidized loop seals. In the cold model, both reactors are fluidized with air at two stages to control the solids circulation. The data presented focus on the solids circulation rates and on pressure profiles of both reactors, depending on selected operating parameters like fluidization gas flow rate, level of gas introduction, loop seal fluidization, and solids inventory.

The energy minimization was used in the solution procedure as an additional stability condition to close the conservation equations. The model was derived without introducing any empirical factors, so it can be used for more flow conditions in circulating fluidized beds (CFBs) than empirical models, especially for heterogeneous gas–solid two-phase flows that include cluster formation. Non-uniform particle distribution in computational cells, which is usually not described by the differential equations, is also considered in the new drag model. Both the drag values given by the model and simulation results for real systems agree well with experimental data.

The experimental data obtained from this work and in the literature show that when the scaling parameter, Gs/( pUg), is modified as Fr−D0.3Gs/( pUg), a detailed hydrodynamic similitude of the gas–solid flow in the fully developed zone of the risers under different operating conditions can be achieved. Furthermore, the experimental results from different gas–solid flow systems also show that as long as Fr−D0.3Gs/( pUg) remains constant, there is the same solid concentration in the fully developed zone of different CFB risers with different particles. With the same Fr−D0.3Gs/( pUg), the local solid concentrations, the descending particle velocities, the cluster frequencies and the solid concentrations inside clusters in the fully developed zone of the risers all display the same axial and radial distribution, respectively. In other words, the empirical similarity parameter, Fr−D0.3Gs/( pUg), appears to have incorporated the effects of operating parameters (Gs and Ug), so that, the gas–solid flow in the fully developed zone of CFB risers under those different operating conditions but having the same Fr−D0.3Gs/( pUg) shows similar micro- and macro-hydrodynamic characteristics. The study shows that the empirical similarity parameter, Fr−D0.3Gs/( pUg), is also independent of the upward gas–solid flow systems.},

The results show that the nozzle gas distributor design has significant effects on the axial and radial flow structure for the FCC and sand particles. At lower superficial gas velocity of less than 8.0 m/s, the upward gas-solid flow of the sand particles decelerates in various degrees with the disappearing of the nozzle gas distributor effect. The upward gas-solid flow of the FCC particles, however, occurs without noticeable deceleration within the range of this study. In the acceleration section, the radial distributions of the local solids concentration of the FCC particles are more uniform than those of sand particles under the same operating conditions; while in the fully developed zone, the sand particles have a more uniform radial distribution than the FCC particles. The gas-solid flow is first developed in the center region, and then extends towards the wall.

The present work considered the particle of different size as different phase, and obtained a collision coefficient by experiment when considering the interaction between particles. The advantage of the ASMM is that this model can save a lot of calculating time comparing with the full Eulerian model. However, higher inlet particle concentration will result in the agglomeration between particles deduced by some mechanisms. In point of this fact, the calculated results based on ASMM have some differences comparing with the practical ones. Therefore, this model still has some discrepancies which plead for further improvement. In spite of this fact, this model can be used to analyze the effect of the inlet particle concentration on the separation characteristics of the cyclone qualitatively in practical applications.},

	abstract     = {We show hydrodynamic boundary conditions to be the inherent consequence of the Onsager principle of minimum energy dissipation, provided the relevant effects of the wall potential appear within a thin fluid layer next to the solid wall, denoted the surface layer. The condition that the effect of the surface layer on the bulk hydrodynamics must be independent of its thickness               h               is shown to imply a set of consistent ‘scaling relationships’ between               h               and the surface-layer variables/parameters. The use of the scaling relations, in conjunction with the surface-layer equations of motion derived from the Onsager principle, directly leads to the hydrodynamic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the surface-layer scaling process both physically and mathematically, and relate the parameters of the boundary conditions to those in the surface-layer equations of motion. In spatial regions outside the surface layer, equivalence between the use of surface-layer dynamics and boundary conditions is numerically demonstrated for Couette flows. As an application of the present approach, we derive the liquid-crystal hydrodynamic boundary conditions in which the rotational and translational dynamics are coupled.},

This paper presents a numerical study on the effects of aspect ratio of rectangular nozzles on the spray characteristics and phase interactions in such spray–gas–solid three-phase flows. The gas–solid flow is simulated via Eulerian two-fluid modeling and the spray is tracked via Lagrangian trajectory approach. Our study shows that the effect of aspect ratio has a significant impact on the penetration length and trajectories of the spray jet under the same flow conditions. The vertically oriented rectangular nozzles (i.e., nozzles with aspect ratios less than unity) have deeper penetration than the horizontally oriented ones (i.e., nozzles with aspect ratios more than unity) with the same nozzle injection area whereas the effect of aspect ratio has little impact on the spray deflection. The spray cross-section maintains the rectangular shape that expands basically following the original fan angle of the nozzle jet. The simulation also shows some strong phase interactions caused by the rapid spray evaporation, such as the formation of a dense layer of solids around the spray from the compression effect of vapor expansion and rigid wall of gas–solids flow chamber and the existence of a large diluted solids region in the vicinity of downstream of nozzle from the combined effects of evaporation and vapor crossflow convection.},

The Reynolds number is modified by taking into account the pipe diameter while the Archimedes number is modified by taking into account various properties that affect each threshold mechanism. Since all threshold velocities could be defined successfully by the same non-dimensional groups it was possible, at the first time, to present a Generalized Master Curve, which provides an overview of all the threshold velocities.

One of the most significant parameters for designing conveying systems is the threshold velocity for picking up the initially at rest deposited particles. Numerous studies focus on the pickup velocity from a horizontal layer of particles. However, the pickup mechanism from hill-shaped deposits has gained much less attention. The main aim of this work is to investigate the air flow over the deposits of particles (including both horizontal layers and hillshaped particles) and to determine the minimum air velocity for picking up the particles from the deposits. Based on our experimental results and an empirical analysis of seven different materials, covering a wide range of properties, we found that the pickup velocity strongly depends on the deposit height and shape. It was also found that there is a relationship between the pickup velocities from particle deposits and from a layer of particles. This relationship takes into account the ratio between the wind tunnel and the deposit height and the particulate solids angle of repose which defines the deposit shape.},

This paper presents measurements of the particle  pressure on the faces of a two-dimensional gas-fluidized bed and gives insight into the  mechanisms by which bubbles generate particle pressure. The particle pressure is  measured by a specially designed ‘particle pressure transducer’. The results show that,  around single bubbles, the most significant particle pressures are generated below  and to the sides of the bubble and that these particle pressures steadily increase and  reach a maximum value at bubble eruption. The dominant mechanism appears to be  defluidization of material in the particle phase that results from the bubble attracting  fluidizing gas away from the surrounding material; the surrounding material is no  longer supported by the gas flow and can only be supported across interparticle  contacts which results in the observed particle pressures. The contribution of particle  motion to particle pressure generation is insignificant.             The magnitude of the particle pressure below a single bubble in a gas-fluidized  bed depends on the bubble size and the density of the solid particles, as might be  expected as the amount of gas attracted by the bubble should increase with bubble  size and because the weight of defluidized material depends on the density of the  solid material. A simple scaling of these quantities is suggested that is otherwise  independent of the bed material.             In freely bubbling gas-fluidized beds the particle pressures generated behave  differently. Overall they are smaller in magnitude and reach their maximum value soon  after the bubble passes instead of at eruption. In this situation, it appears that the  bubbles interact with one another in such a way that the de uidization effect below a  leading bubble is largely counteracted by refluidizing gas exiting the roof of trailing  bubbles.},

The models thus developed are termed first principles models (or white-box models). Over time, computational power became cheaper, and massive amounts of data became available for modeling. This led to the development of cutting edge machine learning models (black-box models) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hybrid models (gray-box models) are a combination of first principles and machine learning models. The development of hybrid models has captured the attention of researchers as this combines the best of both modeling paradigms. Recent attention to this field stems from the interest in explainable AI (XAI), a critical requirement as AI systems become more pervasive. This work aims at identifying and categorizing various hybrid models available in the literature that integrate machine-learning models with different forms of domain knowledge. Benefits such as enhanced predictive power, extrapolation capabilities, and other advantages of combining the two approaches are summarized. The goal of this article is to consolidate the published corpus in the area of hybrid modeling and develop a comprehensive framework to understand the various techniques presented. This framework can further be used as the foundation to explore rational associations between several models.},

This undesired occurrence has an adverse effect on the performance of the process unit. In the present study, several statistical tools are developed and then used, for the first time, for analyzing routine operating data in order to characterize the dynamics of the riser temperature and other critical variables that may be affecting the riser temperature. Subsequently, a first-principles-based dynamic model of the FCC unit is implemented to closely simulate the FCC unit under investigation. The model is validated by predicting the measured operating data of the FCC unit. This facilitated an in-depth study of the FCC unit, leading to the identification of several strategies for improving the control loop performance of the riser temperature.},

	abstract     = {Riser reactors are frequently applied in catalytic processes involving rapid catalyst deactivation. Typically heterogeneous flow structures prevail because of the clustering of particles, which impacts the quality of the gas–solid contact. This phenomenon results as a competition between fluid–particle interaction (i.e., drag) and particle–particle interaction (i.e., collisions). In this study, five drag force correlations were used in a combined computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method Immersed Boundary Model to predict the clustering. The simulation results were compared with experimental data obtained from a pseudo-2D riser in the fast fluidization regime. The clusters were detected on the basis of a core–wake approach using constant thresholds. Although good predictions for the global (solids volume fraction and mass flux) variables and cluster (spatial distribution, size, and number of clusters) variables were obtained with two of the approaches in most of the simulations, all the correlations show significant deviations in the onset of a pneumatic transport regime. However, the correlations of Felice ( Int. J. Multiphase Flow 1994, 20, 153−159) and Tang et al. [ AIChE J. 2015, 61 (2), 688−698] show the closest correspondence for the time-averaged quantities and the clustering behavior in the fast fluidization regime.},

A series of experiments varying particle size, particle density, particle loading and flow Re has been conducted.

On the other hand, the smaller polystyrene particles (120 9m) bring about a decrease in the number of wall ejections, causing a decrease in the measured intensities and Reynolds stresses. These effects are enhanced as the particle loading is increased. It was also found that the heavier glass particles (88 \#m) do not bring about any significant modulation of turbulence. In addition, measurements of the burst frequency and the mean streak-spacing show no significant change with increase in particle loading.

ERT technique is based on conductivity measurement of the continuous phase (water in this study), which provides color-coded cross-sectional view of phases with a frequency of up to 250 images per second. The local conductivity measured by a number of electrodes located at the periphery of the plane was then further converted into a local phase concentration distribution based on Maxwell’s relation. The results obtained by PTs, when combined with ERT results, were used to determine gas and solid holdups. Fibre optic probe was also employed to measure gas holdup independently. To measure gas and solid holdup, a model was introduced to exploit the fibre optic data in differentiating gas bubbles from solid particles in the riser.

	abstract     = {The application of liquid–solid circulating fluidized beds (LSCFB) is steadily increasing in the chemical, biochemical and other industries. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) as an imaging technique was employed for the study of flow parameters such as phase holdup, velocity distribution of individual phases in LSCFB. ERT is a non-invasive technique based on conductivity measurement of the continuous phase, which also provides color-coded cross-sectional view of phases with a frequency of up to 250 images per second. The local conductivity measured by a number of electrodes located at the periphery of the plane was then further converted into a local phase concentration distribution based on Maxwell's relation. Local solids holdup also measured by using optical fibre probe to compare and verify the result obtained by ERT. By cross-correlation between the data obtained from a pair of planes of ERT, one upstream and one downstream, the phase propagation velocity was determined. Water was used as the continuous and conductive phase and glass beads and lava rocks (LR) of 500 m sizes were used as the solid and non-conductive phase in this investigation. Radial non-uniformity of phase holdups was observed at different superficial liquid velocities. Solids holdup was higher in regions close to the wall and low in the central area. Such non-uniformity in phase holdup decreased with increasing liquid velocity. Both solids holdup and radial non-uniformity increased with superficial solids velocity. The solids propagation velocity increased in the central region under different superficial liquid velocities. Good agreement was observed between the data obtained from the two methods.},

Today, the circulating fluid bed reactor is used in numerous industrial processes or has passed the pilot or demonstration stage in many others. Large-scale CFB calciners have replaced the rotary kiln in the alumina industry. Combustion of carbon-containing fossil fuels and process residues for energy supply with accompanying low levels of noxious emissions is one of the most promising fields of future applications, especially in the power industry and municipal combined heat and power generation. Dry-scrubbing of process and power plant waste gases is also promising. Many more industrial applications of CFB reactors can be expected.},

New CFB-processing routes will be explained with examples from utility, cement, steel and petrochemical industries. CFB research and development have to concentrate upon risers and downers as well, as single units or integrated into a processing system.

Time-averaged solids flux profiles exhibit a typically flattened parabolic shape with a region of downward flow adjacent to the riser wall. These profiles do not generally exhibit axial symmetry and a minimum of six radial profiles measurements are found to be necessary to describe the flow pattern adequately. These angular non-uniformities are reproducible, difficult to eliminate and although their form is probably system dependent, it is thought that such non-uniformities are likely to exist in all such gas-particle flow systems to a greater or lesser extent. Detail of the nature of the flowing suspension near to the riser wall has been delineated by analysis of variations in local solids flux with time measured using an adaptation of the same sampling probe.},

Particles in this region were found to move predominantly downwards, against the main gas flow. High density groups or swarms of particles typically arch-shaped were observed to descend in contact with the wall at velocities in the range 0.3-0.4 m s-‘. The distribution of swarm descent velocities was shown to be little affected by changes in superficial gas velocity over the range 3-5 m s-l and imposed mean solids mass flux over the range 2 to 80 kg m-* s- r. A region of steady bulk downflow of solids with a velocity of approximately 1.0 m s-l was observed to appear a few millimetres from the wall at mean suspension densities greater than 5.6 kg rnm3. Motion of particles in contact with the riser was analysed by identification of three flow forms; dilute, dense and swarm flow. Results of the analysis are linked with the observations of other workers concerning the onset of the so-called ‘similar profiles’ regime. The relationship between the measured effective particle swarm length and the cross-sectional mean suspension density was established and the implications for modelling suspension-to-wall heat transfer discussed.},

The flow structure is characterised by measurement of radial profiles of solids momentum and solids volume fraction in a riser 0.09 m in diameter and 7.2 m high using a momentum probe and capacitance tomography. The solids used were sand with a Sauter mean diameter of 100 μm and particle density of 2650 kg/m3. The core-annalus suspension structure typically found in the upper dilute region of the fast bed is found to extend throughout the S-shaped profile and into the lower dense region. However, the direction of solids flow in the annulus changes from downwards in the upper dilute region to upwards in the lower dense region. The interface between the regions (the middle of the S) is found to be a region of relatively low axial solids momentum throughout the riser cross-section. The fast fluidized bed structure suggested by these observations is presented in the form of a diagram.},

Liquid-like nanoparticle organic hybrid materials functionalized with polyethylenimine (NOHM-I-PEI) are incorporated into a shell material and UV-cured to produce gas-permeable solid sorbents with uniform NOHMs loading (NPEI-SIPs). The CO2 capture kinetics of NPEI-SIPs show a remarkable 50-fold increase compared to that of neat NOHM-I-PEI due to a large increase in the NOHMs-CO2 interfacial surface area provided by the SIP design. The optimum NOHM-I-PEI loading and sorption temperature are found to be ≈49 wt\% and 50 °C, respectively, and NPEI-SIPs exhibit great thermal stability over 20 CO2 capture/sorbent regeneration temperature swing cycles. The pseudoequilibrium CO2 loadings of NPEI-SIPs under humid conditions are as high as 3.1 mmol CO2 g−1NPEI − SIPs for 15 vol\% CO2 (postcombustion capture) and 1.7 mmol CO2 g−1NPEI − SIPs for 400 ppm (direct air capture). These findings suggest that NPEI-SIPs can effectively capture CO2 from a wide range of CO2 concentrations including direct air capture while allowing the flexible design of CO2 capture reactors by combining the benefits of liquid solvents and solid sorbents.},

This study assesses the potential environmental impact of near term ACBM production. Updated findings from recent technoeconomic assessments (TEAs) of ACBM and a life cycle assessment of Essential 8™ were utilized to perform a life cycle assessment of near-term ACBM production. A scenario analysis was conducted utilizing the metabolic requirements examined in the TEAs of ACBM and a purification factor from the Essential 8™ life cycle assessment was utilized to account for growth medium component processing. The results indicate that the environmental impact of near-term ACBM production is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than median beef production if a highly refined growth medium is utilized for ACBM production.},

Our asymptotic theory relies on a domain perturbation approach for small roughness amplitudes of the channel and holds for general surface shapes expandable as a Fourier series. We determine an anisotropic dispersion tensor, which depends on the characteristic wavelengths and amplitude of the surface structure. For surfaces whose corrugations are tilted with respect to the applied flow direction, we find that dispersion along the principal direction (i.e. the principal eigenvector of the dispersion tensor) is at an angle to the main flow direction and becomes enhanced relative to classical Taylor dispersion. In contrast, dispersion perpendicular to it can decrease compared to the short-time diffusivity of the particles. Furthermore, for an arbitrary surface shape represented in terms of a Fourier decomposition, we find that each Fourier mode contributes at leading order a linearly-independent correction to the classical Taylor dispersion diffusion tensor.},

The novelty of the model consists in that besides the complex dynamics of the reactor–regenerator system, it also includes the dynamic model of the fractionator, as well as a five lumps kinetic model for the riser. Tight control is achieved using the QIHNMPC approach. The MHE-NMPC considers important features of a real-time control algorithm, resulting in a framework for practical NMPC implementation, such as: state and parameter estimation and efficient solution of the optimisation problem. In the NMPC approach, only measurements available in practice are considered, whereas the rest of the states are estimated together with uncertain model parameters, via MHE technique. Using an efficient numerical implementation based on the multiple shooting algorithm real-time feasibility of the approach is achieved. The incentives of the proposed approaches are assessed on the simulated industrial FCCU.},

Studies based on first (HIPWIND) and second order (HIGHER UPWIND) interpolation schemes were carried out. The difference in the results using the two schemes was found to be negligible. The Computational Fluid Dynamic Technique (CFD) was adopted as a tool to predict downer reactor dynamic, comparing the proposed model with experimental data available in the literature. Good agreement between experimental data and model predictions was verified. Therefore CFD techniques proved to be a powerful tool to predict the fluid dynamic of inlet changing of downer reactors, and it can be used with success in chemical process optimization.},

However, acoustic interactions between bubbles complicate interpretations of measured frequencies in terms of the bubble sizes that are of practical interest. Experiments were undertaken on the emissions of a bubble chain when a just-formed bubble at one end of the chain created a sound pulse. This is an idealised paradigm for many applications. The chain was a one-dimensional line of bubbles fixed with known bubble sizes and inter-bubble spacings. Frequencies naturally emitted by the chain were measured for various bubble sizes and spacings, including cases such that the bubbles were close to touching. Semi-empirical fits were found relating the bubble size and number to the lowest and highest-measurable peak frequencies. It was found that all data collapsed onto two curves, one for the lowest-peak and one for the highest-peak frequency. This was confirmed by running numerical simulations for wider ranges of parameters than available experimentally. The results suggest that for a bubble chain, measurements of two peak frequencies could be used to determine the bubble size and also the number of interacting bubbles.},

	abstract     = {Additive manufacturing has the potential to unlock a large degree of geometric freedom in the shaping of catalytic material, thereby providing new possibilities to optimize catalyst holdup, pressure drop and heat and mass transfer characteristics. In this modelling study, baffled logpile structures are proposed as a promising candidate to exploit this potential, by shaping the catalytic material as a static mixer, generating cross-flow. An OpenFOAM Computational Fluid Dynamics study was performed on various 2D structure designs to map the trade-off between heat transfer, pressure drop and residence time distribution as a function of the design, length and gap spacing of the baffle. It is observed that structures with the longest baffles provide optimal heat transfer performance, and that the baffle gap spacing can be used to tailor the trade-off between heat transfer and pressure drop. In comparison to a packed bed filled with spherical particles, the novel structures offer a heat transfer rate four to six times as high at the same pressure drop. Whilst full 3D simulations, validated by experiments, remain to complete the analysis, the current work illustrates the potential of this novel class of structured catalyst materials for intensified chemical reactors.},

The model captures the main transport–kinetic interactions at both the particle and reactor scale. Two different kinetic models from the literature that either include or neglect the role of solid-state diffusion of oxygen in the catalyst bulk are compared in terms of their impact on overall reactor performance. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a means of defining a macroscopic cell-type model for describing the flow patterns in an industrial-scale gas–solids riser is also described. Predictions for the conversion of n-butane and yield of MAN are presented as a function of selected operating variables, and the impact of the variable model parameters on the predictions is briefly assessed. It is shown that the predictions are particularly sensitive to the kinetic model. The relative importance of the interactions between the chemical kinetics and the hydrodynamics is also highlighted. © 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract     = {In practical applications of inkjet printing the nozzles in a printhead have intermittent idle periods, during which ink can evaporate from the nozzle exit. Inks are usually multicomponent where each component has its own characteristic evaporation rate resulting in concentration gradients within the ink. These gradients may directly and indirectly (via Marangoni flows) alter the jetting process and thereby its reproducibility and the resulting print quality. In the present work we study selective evaporation from an inkjet nozzle for water-glycerol mixtures. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and numerical simulations, we investigate changes in mixture composition with drying time. By monitoring the acoustics within the printhead, and subsequently modeling the system as a mass-spring-damper system, the composition of the mixture can be obtained as a function of drying time. The results from the analytical model are validated using numerical simulations of the full fluid mechanical equations governing the printhead flows and pressure fields. Furthermore, the numerical simulations reveal that the time-independent concentration gradient we observe in the experiments is due to the steady state of water flux through the printhead. Finally, we measure the number of drop formation events required in this system before the mixture concentration within the nozzle attains the initial (predrying) value, and find a stronger than exponential trend in the number of drop formations required. These results shed light on the complex physiochemical hydrodynamics associated with the drying of ink at a printhead nozzle, and help in increasing the stability and reproducibility of inkjet printing.},

The hydrodynamic behaviour is described and characterised by some specific gas and liquid velocities. Particles are easily fluidized and can be uniformly distributed over the whole height of the column. The effect of parameters like liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, particle loading, particle size, and solid density on gas hold up and effect of gas flow rate, solid density and particle size on solid hold up, energy consumption and minimum fluidization velocity has been studied. At the elevated pressures a superior method for better prediction of minimum fluidization velocity and terminal settling velocities has been adopted. The results have been interpreted with Bernoulli’s theorem and Richardson–Zaki equation. Based on the assumption of the gas and liquid as a pretend fluid, a simplification has been made to predict the particle terminal settling velocities. The Richardson–Zaki parameter n0 was compared with Renzo’s results. A correlation has been proposed with the experimental results for the three-phase fluidization.},

Since part of the pressure waves travelling through large (industrial) fluidized beds is only detectable in a limited area of the bed, pressure measurements need to be performed at several positions to cover the whole bed. We examine these local pressure waves (caused by, e.g., passing bubbles or coalescing bubbles) in a 0.80 m i.d. bubbling fluidized bed of Geldart B particles. Experiments and simulations are performed to determine the intensity decrease as local pressure waves propagate from their origin. A new spectral method is applied to determine the degree of coherence for pressure signals measured at two different positions in a fluidized bed. For a superficial gas velocity of 5umf, local pressure waves can be detected up to a radial distance of about 0.5 m from their origin; this distance is somewhat lower for lower gas velocities. This means that the radial spacing of pressure probes should not exceed 1 m. For large diameter beds with a bed height below 1.5 m, a set of probes at a single level and at several radial positions is sufficient to observe or monitor the dynamic state of the complete bed; the probes should preferably be placed at a height of 30\% to 40\% of the total bed height.},

Two separate reactors, one for air and one for fuel, are used. Oxygen is transferred between the two by means of an oxygen carrier. Since fuel and combustion air never mix, the combustion products, mostly CO2 and H2O, are not diluted with N2. Consequently, a condenser is sufficient to obtain almost pure CO2. In this paper, the opportunity to utilize chemical-looping for H2 production, with CO2 capture, is examined. The focus is on the thermodynamics and layout of a chemical-looping reformer for natural gas, but system integration for cogeneration of electricity has also been considered. It is found that the proposed reformer systems are very interesting and that their expected performances in several cases are considerably better than for the reference system - a steam reformer with CO2 capture by amine scrubbing.},

Also the program calculates the heat transfer coefficient. Besides that, the program predicts the fluidized bed stability and determines the optimum input gas velocity for fluidized beds to achieve the best thermal behavior. The hydrodynamic model is verified by comparing its results with the computational fluid dynamic code MFIX [1].

Unlike in western countries Indian refineries are often operated in distillate mode requiring design modifications and changes in operating conditions. Riser hydrodynamics together with cracking kinetics are often very useful to simulate the performance of FCC riser reactor and accurately predict conversion of the process. The present paper reports the experimental data on hydrodynamics of a FCC riser including its pressure and voidage profiles along the riser length in a cold model of the FCC unit assembly. Effects of some operating variables on the riser hydrodynamics have been reported.},

	abstract     = {Computer-based video imaging techniques were utilized in order to measure the axial and radial components of particle velocity and voidage profiles in the draft tube region of a semi-circular spouted fluid bed coating device. Computer images were obtained using standard RS- 170 video signals ( 30 frames/s) from an image processing board and a CCD variable shutter speed camera. When measuring particle velocities. low shutter speeds of I-2 ms were utilized. Due to rapid motion of particles, the images obtained were blurred streaks several millimeters in length. The length and direction of streaks were proportional to the magnitude and direction of the projected velocity vector. By using dispersed back lighting, the particle velocity images appeared as light streaks on a dark background. Custom software was written in order to automatically search for and to identify bright streaks and calculate particle velocities. The velocity measurements obtained from the software were compared with data taken with a high speed Kodak video system ( 1000 frames/s with a 20-p,s strobe). The results were in close agreement. The video images for analysis of voidage measurements were obtained using the same techniques as for the velocity measurements except with a shutter speed of 0. i ms. The images thus obtained showed the particles to have a dark outer ring with a light center. The search algorithm for identifying particles involved establishing the gray level for nine different locations: eight compass points and a center point. By searching the frame for the presence of particles, and then comparing the gray levels at the circumference and the center of the particle image it was possible to distinguish between in-tbcus and out-of-focus particles. A comparison of the results using the software with those of standard models made with glass beads, and by visually counting the particles, was in close agreement. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

	abstract     = {A multi-velocity formulation is proposed for the solution of an Eulerian representation of an inert, disperse, and dilute particle-phase of a gas-particle flow. Single-velocity formulations are capable of predicting regions of zero particle concentration but are problematic with crossing particle trajectories or compression waves. The multi-velocity formulation described here can account for crossing particle trajectories by splitting the particle-phase into distinct velocity families which are transported separately in the flow. Switching of the particle families at solid boundaries and due to momentum transfer with the gas-phase is conducted in a manner that enforces conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. This numerical method is combined with a parallel block-based adaptive mesh refinement algorithm that is very effective in treating problems with disparate length scales. The block-based data structure lends itself naturally to domain decomposition and thereby enables efficient and scalable implementations of the algorithm on distributed-memory multi-processor architectures. Numerical results are described to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach for predicting gas-particle flows.},

	abstract     = {An estimation of solid particle dynamics through a fluid has been studied. Although traditional computational fluids dynamics models can predict multiphase flow and the interactions between the fluid and solid particles, a high level of accuracy of an appropriate numerical model for this type of difficulty is still in demand. Some researchers examining this problem dedicated their research to the particle motions under the influence of gravity. Therefore, in this study a modern computational fluid dynamic model, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), was proposed to predict the three-dimensional cubic lid-driven cavity flow and combined with the Lagrangian approach on the prediction of solid particles in the range of different density ratios. To solve the term, flow fluid, the mesoscale numerical scheme of the Multi Relaxation Time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method was used to simulate the objects at higher stability. In the present study, the different densities of the particles were considered and the effects of gravity were included in the calculation. The 4th Runge-Kutta method was functioned to determine the effect of an external force on a particle because this method is accurate enough compared to other known numerical schemes. The hard sphere model was used to model particle-particle and particle-wall collisions. The solid particle subtleties determined using a numerical fluid dynamic simulation of LBM showed good agreement with the reputable benchmark results by previous researchers. Furthermore, according to the results, the dependency of the particle trajectories on the magnitude of the density of the particles can be observed. The results revealed the significant effect of collision, drag force, gravity force, and vortex structure on a particle’s trajectory. Consequently, the LBM model is suitable for this type of problem, and the proposed model is expected to have a wide range of applications.},

Numerical results are presented for different values of loading ratios. The profiles of particle concentration, mean velocity and temperature are shown to be flatter by considering inter-particle collisions, while this effect on the gas mean velocity and temperature is not significant. It is demonstrated that the effect of inter-particle collisions have a dramatic influence on the particle fluctuation velocity. It is shown that the profiles of particle concentration and particle velocity are flattened due to inter-particle collisions and this effect becomes more pronounced with increasing loading ratio. Also, the attenuation of turbulence by inter-particle collisions in the core region of the pipe is increased by increasing loading ratio.},

The FBRs operated at low and high temperatures were inoculated with cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) originally enriched from arctic and hot mining environments, respectively. Ethanol was supplemented as carbon and electron source for SRB. At 88C, ethanol oxidation and sulfate reduction rates increased steadily and reached 320 and 265 mg/LÁday, respectively, after 1 month of operation. After this point, the rates did not change significantly during 130 days of operation. Despite the complete ethanol oxidation and iron precipitation, the average sulfate reduction efficiency was 35 Æ 4\% between days 30 and 130 due to the accumulation of acetate. At 658C, a rapid startup was observed as 99.9, 46, and 29\% ethanol, sulfate, acetate removals, in respective order, were observed after 6 days. The feed pH was decreased gradually from its initial value of 6 to around 3.7 during 100 days of operation. The wastewater pH of 4.3–4.4 was neutralized by the alkalinity produced in acetate oxidation and the average effluent pH was 7.8 Æ 0.8. As in the low temperature FBR, acetate accumulated. Hence, the oxidation of acetate is the ratelimiting step in the sulfidogenic ethanol oxidation by thermophilic and psychrotrophic SRB. The sulfate reduction rate is three times and acetate oxidation rate is four times higher at 658C than at 88C.},

Consumers currently demand foods with high contents of healthy compounds, as well as preserved natural taste and flavour, minimally processed without using artificial additives. Processing alternatives to be applied on plant-based foodstuffs to obtain beverages are mainly referred to as classical thermal treatments that although are effective treatments to ensure safety and extended shelf-life, also cause undesirable changes in the sensory profiles and phytochemical properties of beverages, thus affecting the overall quality and acceptance by consumers. As a result of these limitations, new non-thermal technologies have been developed for plant-based foods/beverages to enhance the overall quality of these products regarding microbiological safety, sensory traits, and content of bioactive nutrients and non-nutrients during the shelf-life of the product, thus allowing to obtain enhanced health-promoting beverages. Accordingly, the present article attempts to review critically the principal benefits and downsides of the main non-thermal processing alternatives (High hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, ultraviolet light, and ultrasound) to set up sound comparisons with conventional thermal treatments, providing a vision about their practical application that allows identifying the best choice for the sectoral industry in non-alcoholic fruit and vegetable-based beverages.},

No systematic modelling efforts have been reported to interpret the cavitation performance of these vortex based devices for cavitation. It is essential to develop a modelling framework for describing performance of cavitation reactors. We have addressed this need in the present work. A comprehensive modelling framework comprising three layers: per – pass performance models (overall process), computational fluid dynamics models (flow on reactor scale) and cavity dynamics models (cavity scale) is developed. The approach and computational models were evaluated using the experimental data on treatment of acetonecontaminated water. The presented models were successful in describing the experimental data using initial cavity size as an adjustable parameter. Efforts were made to quantify optimum operating conditions and scaleup. The developed approach, models and results will provide useful design guidelines for pollutant degradation using vortex based cavitation reactors. It will also provide a sound and useful basis for comprehensive multiscale modelling of hydrodynamic cavitation reactors.},

	abstract     = {Applying parametric models on time series of pressure fluctuations recorded in a fluidized bed, this paper shows that the bed dynamics can be expressed in analogy with a mechanical system of a certain degree. Thus, the pressure signal is assumed to be an output of a linear time-invariant system driven by a forcing function. The forcing function represents a number of apparently random events (e.g. formation of bubbles at the air-distributor, bubble eruptions at the surface of the bed) and may thereby be approximated as white noise. Parametric models are advocated for characterization of the dynamics of fluidized beds when, for various reasons, long data records are not available or when the quality of the recorded signal is poor. An autoregressive model (AR) of the time series is proposed, and it is shown that the order of the model identifies a mechanical equivalent of certain fluidization behaviour. The model is applied to four fluidization time series, previously investigated. The result indicates that fluidized beds behave like single second-order systems or multiple higher-order mechanical systems acting in parallel. Parametric methods are also used for estimation of power spectra of pressure fluctuations. The information obtained is presented in the form of Bode plots to accentuate the behaviour of fluidized beds as linear dynamical systems. The results are compared with the corresponding information obtained by nonparametric methods, now predominantly used. Data requirements (number of samples, sampling frequency) for the use of parametric models are discussed.},

	abstract     = {The interaction between a fluidized bed and the air-supply system is studied numerically in a cold circulating fluidized bed unit. The bed was operated with Group B solids and with an air-distributor pressure-drop similar to that often applied under industrial conditions. The simulations and experiments are compared through power spectral density distributions of pressure fluctuations in the bed and air plenum. This work focuses on the inlet boundary conditions of the numerical simulations, i.e., the purpose is to include a representation of fluctuations in pressure and flow in the air-supply system. The fluctuations are computed and coupled with the simulations of the flow field in the bed and the air plenum, based on an Eulerian approach. Parametric models are employed for spectral estimates as the time consumption for the threedimensional simulation limits the length of the pressure time series. The simulations provide satisfactory agreement with experiments, and it is seen that, under certain conditions, there is a strong interaction between the fluidized bed and the air-supply system in the form of pressure waves, as well as pressure and flow pulsations from the air-supply system, which propagate through the entire system. It is demonstrated that for such a system, the assumption of a uniform inlet gas flow over the air distributor, assumed in most previous fluidized-bed studies, is not appropriate. This study demonstrates the importance of further development of numerical models for simulating the hydrodynamics of fluidized beds, in particular for industrially sized units.},

The type of information resulting from various ways of measuring the pressure in fluidized beds is discussed, as well as the use of absolute versus differential pressure probes. Time series analysis is reviewed; it can be applied to modeled and measured pressure signals in time, frequency, time–frequency and state space. Also, recommendations are provided on the use of the methods of analysis examined.

The tapered angle of the bed has been found to affect the characteristics of the bed. Models based on dimensional analysis have been proposed to predict the critical fluidization velocity and maximum bed pressure drop for gas–solid tapered fluidized beds.

The model comprises thermodynamically consistent multi-species transport in alkaline electrolytes, formation and dissolution of metallic zinc and passivating zinc oxide, as well as multi-phase coexistence in gas diffusion electrodes. For the first time, we simulate zinc shape-change during battery cycling by modeling convection of zinc solids. We validate our model with in-situ tomography of commercial button cells. Two-dimensional volume-averaged simulations of cell voltage and zinc electrode morphology during discharge agree with these measurements. Thus, we can study how electrolyte carbonation limits shelf-life and how zinc shape-change limits cycle-life. The charging current is found to be the major contributor to cycle-life limitations. Finally, we optimize initial anode structure and charge-discharge protocols for improved performance and cycle-ability. Furthermore, we extend our model to a flexible thin-film battery as example of alternative cell design.},

Kinetic experiments were carried out in a standardfixed-bed Berty reactor over the 400°C to 500°C range at atmospheric pressure. The MT0 process was performed in a circulating fluidized bed (riser dimensions: internal diameter 0.03 m, height 11 m) that is coupled with a regenerator for continuously burning off the coke deposits. Conversion of more than 98\% and a very high olelin selectivity have been achieved. Based on the estimated kinetic parameters and on a CFF3 reactor model, methanol conversion and product distribution is predicted and compared with experimental data. The agreement is satisfactory for the whole temperature range examined.},

A nickel supported on -alumina oxygen carrier is investigated in this study, for use in a CLC process. Oxygen carriers with various nickel loadings on alumina are prepared according to the incipient wetness technique. The reactivity and stability of the prepared oxygen carrier samples, during repeated reduction–oxidation cycles, is demonstrated using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation. Pulse chemisorption results show that the dispersion and active crystallite diameter of the nickel particles remain constant over multiple reduction–oxidation cycles, indicating that no agglomeration occurs up to a nickel loading of 20 wt\% supported on alumina. The stability and reactivity of the oxygen carriers, under industrial relevant conditions, are also investigated using the CREC fluidized bed riser simulator. It is observed that a 20 wt\% nickel supported on alumina oxygen carrier is stable under industrial relevant fluidized bed reaction conditions, converting 76\% of methane to carbon dioxide and water vapor, the combustion products. The metal support interaction is assessed by H2 temperature programmed desorption, which shows that the metal-support interaction decreases as more nickel is loaded onto the alumina support.},

The evaporation of droplets is studied using three models: the classical homogeneous model and the heterogeneous vaporisation models from the literature. Droplets are modelled using the Lagrangian framework model for particles moving through a fluid. This was coupled with the gas–solid flow field describing the catalyst particulate transport in the riser. Cracking reaction kinetics are modelled using a four-lumped model. The model was then validated against published plant data. The model performed well in terms of gas oil conversion, gasoline yield, pressure drop, and phase temperature profiles. Therefore, it is suitable for use in the design and optimisation of new and existing FCC unit risers, particularly in cost–benefit analysis considering the current push away from petroleum energy sources. It was found that vaporisation models are largely insignificant in terms of gas oil conversion profiles and gasoline yield for usual operation conditions of FCC risers, which is a finding that had yet to be proven in the literature. Vaporisation models are shown to only affect conversion and yield when the initial droplet exceeds 2000~μm.},

	abstract     = {The performance of model predictive controllers (MPCs) strongly depends on the precision of the prediction model. Nonlinear systems, such as neutralization reactors, provide special challenges to MPC design. Linear prediction models may be inadequate to describe the process at all operating points. One alternative is the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as prediction models. ANNs are nonlinear structures that can be trained to reproduce the process behavior. Inside MPC schemes, ANNs can rapidly predict the process response to a control action. The time-consuming step for ANN training is to obtain a representative overall data set from experiments or simulation data from the studied process. In the present work, we propose to obtain this data set from computational simulations using a first principles model. However, mismatches were found between rigorous simulation and actual pH process responses. Those deviations were naturally transferred to the internal neural model, as a consequence, actual control problems were identified. Avoiding high costs of performing actual experimental runs for ANN and MPC design, we used a real-time adaptation algorithm, based on extended Kalman filter (EKF), that acts to correct the ANN prediction while process is running. The adaptive model ANN-based MPC was able to maintain the actual controlled process, in all operating conditions tested. The sum of square error of pH was reduced in 64.3\%, compared to the ANN-based MPC without model adaptation. Using a Kalman filter to adapt the internal model has significantly improved the MPC performance, reducing oscillations and maintaining the controlled variable in the setpoint, even in servo regulatory situations of industrial practice. In addition, the proposed scheme has great potential for controlling highly nonlinear processes.},

Two different spectral methods are considered, namely Fourier pseudo-spectral method and Chebyshev multidomain spectral method. The pseudo-spectral method is used for the simulation of homogeneous turbulence. DNS of both incompressible and compressible flows with one- and two-way couplings are reported. For LES of particle-laden flows, two new models, developed by the authors, account for the effect of sub-grid fluctuations on the dispersed phase. The Chebyshev multidomain method is employed for the works on inhomogeneous flows. A number of canonical flows are discussed, including flow past a square cylinder, channel flow and flow over backward-facing step.

In the mining and mineral processing industries, these systems are chains of processes with a complex interplay among the equipment, control and processed material. The material properties have natural variations that are usually only known at certain locations. Therefore, we explored a material-oriented approach to digital twins with a particle representation of the granular media. In digital form, the material is treated as pseudo-particles, each representing a large collection of real particles of various sizes, shapes and mineral properties. Movements and changes in the state of the material are determined by the combined data from control systems, sensors, vehicle telematics and simulation models at locations where no real sensors could see. The particle-based representation enables material tracking along the chain of processes. Each digital particle can act as a carrier of observational data generated by the equipment as it interacts with the real material. This make it possible to better learn the material properties from process observations and to predict the effect on downstream processes. We tested the technique on a mining simulator and demonstrated the analysis that can be performed using data from cross-system material tracking.},

Compared with the one-stage FCC, the gasoline produced from the TSR FCC contains less alkene and more iso-alkane. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Compared with the conventional single-stage riser FCC, the TSR FCC achieves a higher conversion and significantly improves product distribution and quality. The improved process performance of TSR FCC technology is attributed to catalyst relay and subsection reaction. The TSR FCC can also be a process option for debottlenecking the conventional FCC, which increases throughput capacity up to 30\%.

Lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly used rechargeable batteries in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and E-vehicles. Li-ion batteries have limitations like less power density, high cost, non-environment friendly, flammable electrolytes, poor cycle performance, etc. Supercapacitors have high power density, and long cycle life but lesser energy density and high self-discharge rate. High-performance, smart, next-generation rechargeable batteries like Zn ion, Li-air, Li-S, Na-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid capacitors can be a good alternative to traditional Lithium-cobalt batteries. In this review article, we focussed on different energy storage devices like Lithium-ion, Lithium-air, Lithium-Zn-air, Lithium-Sulphur, Sodium-ion rechargeable batteries, and super and hybrid capacitors. Emphases are made on the progress made on the fabrication, electrode material, electrolyte, and economic aspects of different electrochemical energy storage devices.

Reynolds number is used to characterize the dynamics of fluid corresponding to single phase channel flows. Meanwhile, different flow behavior exists in curved channels even at fixed Reynolds number, where the curvature varies as shown by Brethouwer [“Turbulent flow in curved channels,” J. Fluid Mech. 931, A21 (2022)]. In the present study, we show how wall-bounded turbulent flow behaves on sharply bending the channel by investigating the time averaged velocity profiles at the straight section, at the bend, and in the inclined section. The well-known logarithmic behavior of the time averaged normalized velocity profile is retained, where the von Kármán and the additive constants assume altered values depending on the sharp bend inclination. The near-wall fluctuations at the bend are enhanced, which is due to diffusion of counter-rotating vortices leading to increased turbulent activity. In terms of spatial structure of the random fluctuating field, the two-point correlation statistics suggest that multiple high speed and low speed streak pairs are generated, and there are multiple streamwise vortices of different sizes when bend inclination is increased. Budgets of turbulent kinetic energy are presented for various inclinations of the bend at different sections of the bend channel, which depicts that turbulent kinetic energy is modulated at the bend.},

The complexity of turbulence manifests in both its scale distribution and its complex dependence on physical conditions. We propose a system approach for the study of turbulence that comprises two parts, a scaling analysis that gives rise to a set of local statistical measures for the quantification of the fluctuation state, and a system analysis that determines the spatial variation of scaling over the entire domain of the flow. In this paper, we present the basis for the approach, which is the existence of a hierarchical similarity (HS) property that holds for a variety of turbulent systems. Three systems will be discussed: a mixing layer flow of fluid motions, a chemical reaction system modelled by the complex Ginzburg–Landou equations displaying two-dimensional spiral and chaotic patterns, and DNA sequences that record long-term evolutionary history of biological species. All three systems have a continuous range of fluctuations across scales, and all display the HS property which then holds as the universal principle of the self-organization. It is proposed that the parameters derived from the HS study can be used for the description of local ensemble of turbulent structures, and their spatial variations form a new set of statistical measures of turbulence. Future study involving the measurement of the nonlinear response of the ensemble of eddies to external factors is discussed at the end.},

We theoretically derived the interfacial measurement theorem relating the local instantaneous interfacial velocity to local measurable velocities of the multi-sensor probe in the improvement. Based on this theorem, theoretical measurement methods for the local instantaneous interfacial normal direction and the local time-averaged interfacial area concentration (IAC) using the four-sensor probe were presented. An interface-pairing signal-processing scheme was proposed to identify the same interfaces from the sequential signals detected by different sensors. The practical application of the improved IAC methodology to the two-phase flow in a vertical large diameter pipe showed that the four-sensor probes (together with the interface-pairing signal-processing scheme) could effectively measure the local time-averaged IACs with high effective interface percentages not only in the one-dimensional two-phase flow but also in the multi-dimensional two-phase flow. The measurement error analysis indicated that the errors from the bubble deformation and velocity variation due to the sensor piecing were negligible if we only applied the multisensor probe to the two-phase flow with the bubbles having much larger size than the sensor diameter. The total error from both the escaped and missing bubbles in the void fraction and IAC measurements was estimated at about 15.75\% in the two-phase flow in a pool.},

Experiments are realized in a focused Gaussian beam and the acquisition of transmission signals is achieved by using a high-resolution digital oscilloscope. Measurements on spherical and non-spherical particles over very wide ranges of particle concentrations are presented.

	abstract     = {Water–gas flow in heterogeneous porous media is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. A pore-scale investigation can help to understand the mechanisms of water–gas flow. This study employs a direct simulation method to model the immiscible water–gas flow while tracking the phase interface via the phase-field method. We first verified the mathematical model by layered two-phase flow and capillary intrusion tests. Then, the quartet structure generation set was used to generate a heterogeneous porous media, based on which water–gas displacement was simulated. The characteristics of drainage and imbibition displacements were systematically investigated. Results show that the forced imbibition process shows stable displacement due to cooperative filling, yet with local capillary fingering. Capillary valve effects always exist during the process, making the capillary force act as both driving and resistance forces in heterogeneous porous media. Nevertheless, these pore-scale events inhabit the rapid breakthrough in the small pore-throat zone, ensuring the uniform advancement of the interface. During drainage, viscous fingering in the wide pore-throat zone and capillary fingering in the narrow pore-throat zone are simultaneously observed. Compared with the imbibition process, the water–gas front advances faster due to the smaller viscous force of invading fluid. The phase distribution after drainage displacement at different capillary numbers is quite different due to inconsistent flow patterns. Nevertheless, the final phase saturation of the imbibition process under different capillary numbers is similar, but the area of each type is different. For both the imbibition and drainage processes, the larger the capillary number, the higher the final displacement efficiency.},

For this, a linear model has been widely used to reduce the computational burden for iterative simulation and optimization over time, but it caused high inaccuracy of the control system. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was adopted instead of using the existing linearized model in order to increase the speed of optimization and accuracy of the model. For a case study, a depropanizer was modeled using Aspen HYSYS, and all feasible operation scenarios were considered to generate massive amounts of dynamic simulation data. Then, the accumulated data was implemented to the ANN for training, and it was tested. Once the verification was completed, the model was incorporated with an optimization algorithm in MPC system. For testing its performance, set point change and introduction of disturbances were applied to the model, and efficiency of the MPC was compared with the conventional control such as PID feedback control. The analysis results showed better performance (i.e., shorter settling time and rise time) of the MPC against the PID control. This methodology can be widely used in various types of control systems in the industry.},

	abstract     = {Modeling particle dispersion in turbulent flows is very complex. Several publications in this field have dealt with both the experimental and modeling aspects of turbulent particle dispersion. This paper gives a broad overview of different modeling techniques discussed in the literature in order to describe the problem of particle dispersion in dilute flows. Unlike other reviews of this subject, this paper maintains a simple approach in explaining mathematically and conceptually the complex issues involved in modeling. Some fundamental concepts, such as key characteristics of turbulent flow and the nature of interaction between turbulence and an individual particle under simplified conditions, are discussed. The authors have attempted to present several definitions (such as homogeneous flow, stationary condition, and integral time scale) that are commonly used to imply certain assumptions or as conceptual tools to derive a model. As indicated, a review of models that are capable of predicting the dispersion of dilute concentration of particles in turbulent flows is presented. The models are described in a simplistic way through use of previously explained ideas and concepts. One of the important practical applications of such dilute twophase flow models deals with the problem of pulverized-coal combustion. The final part of the paper discusses some of the key issues involved in comprehensive pulverized-coal combustion models. The primary objective of this work is to provide a basic understanding of the subject and hence to serve as an introduction to the theoretical world of turbulent particle dispersion.

	abstract     = {Pressure gradients have been measured for vertical flows of slurries of particles with diameters between 1.37 and 3.4 mm in pipes of diameter 26 and 40 mm. By expressing the wall shear stress as the sum of fluid and particle components, the wall stresses for the particles have been evaluated. The stresses increase with particle diameter and density, mean flow velocity and particle concentration. Measurements of the velocity of the particles closest to the pipe wall suggest that considerable distortion of the velocity distribution occurs, compared to that of the clear carrier fluid. The measurements confirm that a region of reduced particle concentration forms at the pipe wall, with coarse particles giving a pronounced change of this type. The wall stresses resemble those discovered by Bagnold for particles sheared in Couette flow. In Bagnold’s experiments, wall stresses were found to be strongly dependent on solids concentration. Since the particle concentration at the wall was unknown in the present investigation, a correlation for wall stresses has been obtained in terms of the mean concentration. The correlation can be used to estimate pressure gradients for vertical flows of nearly isometric angular particles.},

Furthermore, CCS can enable decarbonization of difficult-to-abate industrial processes and can support net CO2 removal from the atmosphere through bioenergy coupled with CCS or direct air capture. Here we review the development of porous materials as next-generation sorbents for CO2 capture applications. We focus on stream- and sector-specific challenges while highlighting case studies within the context of the rapidly shifting energy landscape. We conclude with a discussion of key needs from the materials community to expand deployment of carbon capture technologies.},

To study the long-range spatial correlation of the particle velocities, a conditional average, for a given fluid turbulent flow, is introduced.

	abstract     = {The interest in cavitating flow reactors has intensified over recent years, and a significant amount of research effort has been focussed on demonstrating the potential applications of hydrodynamic cavitation. The knowledge base on the design of devices to optimise cavitation yield, performance and industrial scalability remains lacking however. It is essential to develop a sound understanding of the key hydrodynamic characteristics of cavitation devices to address these knowledge gaps. This work presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation into the hydrodynamic behaviour of cavitating devices which feature linear and swirling flows. Two of the most commonly utilized cavitation device geometries are studied, namely orifice and Venturi, with and without swirl. These devices are compared to a high swirl flow device (vortex diode). A series of experimental configurations were designed with the aid of multiphase, unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations, so as to achieve matching power input in terms of flow rate versus pressure drop across all 5 device configurations, allowing their cavitation characteristics to be directly compared on a consistent basis. High speed flow visualisation and detailed numerical predictions are presented which clearly describe the influence that key parameters such as swirl ratio and Reynolds number have on the nature of the observed cavitating flow structures. Cavitation inception conditions are described for each device, with Venturi and vortex devices shown to generate incipient cavitation at lower pressure ratios than orifice devices. Cavitation numbers are computed, which indicate that values of unity are obtained at inception across the range of devices provided that appropriate characteristic velocities are defined. Swirl is identified as an important parameter in cavitation device design, with the swirling flow device designs shown to successfully move the cavitating region away from solid surfaces towards the device axis. Importantly, this is achieved without an energy consumption penalty; the results describe how swirl can be utilized to design devices which minimise or eliminate the risk of surface erosion.},

In this study, we report the results pertaining to hydrodynamic study with a view to ascertaining the type of fluidization prevailing on the column’s stage and the operating range of liquid and solid flow rates for the steady and stable operation of the column without loading or flooding with excess solid or water flow rates. Residence time distribution (RTD) study was carried out to investigate the extent of mixing on the stages. In addition, the experimental measurements for pressure-drops were made over a wide range of operating conditions including number of stages, height of the downspout on every stage, and the liquid and solid flow rates. Based on the data, empirical correlations were developed using scale-up analysis for predicting pressure-drop, bed porosity and average bed height during cross-flow fluidization apparently prevalent on the stage.

Using the discrete element method approach, the mechanism of cavity size hysteresis in the presence of gas flow has been studied. The modeling results on cavity size have been compared with experiments and show a reasonable agreement. It is found that bed history, interparticle interaction forces, and gas drag all play an important role in the formation of cavities. The bed porosity in the decreasing gas velocity case was always found higher than the increasing gas velocity. The net gas drag at any location above the gas injection point in the bed decreases as the gas velocity is increased. It is also found that the change in interparticle interaction forces with gas flow rate is a major cause of the hysteresis phenomenon.},

In this paper, we present a new approach to compute the coefficients of the distribution matrix, which is, both in terms of computational speed and complexity, more easy to implement as compared to the original approach developed in our group. The new approach is of the same accuracy as the original approach as is demonstrated by studying mixing in the standard two-dimensional cavity flow. The power of the new approach is that it can easily be implemented to analyze mixing in complex geometries where the original approach fails. This is demonstrated by analyzing mixing in a static Sulzer SMX mixer. To enhance the availability of the mapping method for general users of CFD in commercial packages like Fluent, CFX, Star CD, etc., we finally add an example of an implementation of the new approach in Matlab, applying it to study mixing in a time periodic sine flow (TPSF).},

However, while these models are typically accurate, they are custom-designed for individual systems, making system-to-system (S2S) transferability difficult. This occurs even when substantial similarities exist in the process dynamics across different chemical systems. To address this challenge, we developed a novel time-series-transformer (TST) framework that exploits the powerful transfer learning capabilities inherent in transformer algorithms. This was demonstrated using readily available process data obtained from different crystallizers operating under various operational scenarios. Using this extensive dataset, we trained a TST model (CrystalGPT) to exhibit remarkable S2S transferability not only across all pre-established systems, but also to an unencountered system. CrystalGPT achieved a cumulative error across all systems, which is eight times superior to that of existing ML models. Additionally, we coupled CrystalGPT with a predictive controller to reduce the variance in setpoint tracking to just 1\%.},

	abstract     = {Sono-assisted adsorption process is a clean, resourceful and rapid method for elimination of toxic species from water. Mesoporous zeolite Y (NaY) was synthesized from rice husk ash (RHA), using a three-step technique and then modified with iron using an ion-exchange method. As-synthesized NaY, iron-modified zeolite Y (IMZY), and commercial zeolite Y (CZY) were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) analysis. The EDX analysis implies the presence of iron in the structure of NaY. The swift sono-assisted adsorption of As(V) from aqueous solution was compared with conventional adsorption in the presence of all three adsorbents: NaY, IMZY, and CZY. The batch sono-adsorption technique was investigated using influenced parameters of solution pH (2−12), adsorbent dose (0.01−1.0 g/ L), sonication time (0−90 min), and initial As(V) concentration (10−50 mg/L), based on the percentage of As(V) removal. The highest removal of As(V) was obtained as 40.31\% by NaY, 99.90\% by IMZY and 41.24\% by CZY. The adsorption isotherms was best fitted with the Freundlich isotherm model, which indicates the multimolecular surface adsorption and pseudo-second-order kinetic model for all three adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacities of NaY, IMZT, and CZY for As(V) were 3.38, 94.51, and 3.34 mg/g, respectively, for 0.5 g/L adsorbents. The batch experimentation results demonstrated that IMZY could be used for swift and effective removal of As(V), which are frequently existing in groundwater. The work also provides a cradle-to-cradle solution to address problematic solid-waste RHA.},

Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model. Simple analytic rules for model reduction are presented to obtain a model in this form, including the “half rule” for obtaining the effective time delay.},

A particular feature is the ability to calculate the particle density ®eld accurately even in the vicinity of discontinuities, particlefree `shadow' zones and particle separations from solid surfaces. The paper discusses the ill-posedness of the Eulerian equations and describes the numerical scheme, focusing on (i) the particle boundary condition at solid surfaces, (ii) the capture of discontinuities in the particle density ®eld, (iii) special techniques to handle shadow zones, (iv) convergence acceleration for particle ¯ows with very small Stokes numbers and, (v) the possibility of crossing particle trajectories. Applications of the method are illustrated by calculations of particle ¯ow over a circular cylinder and through a turbine cascade.

Laboratory model tests were performed with a mass and funnel flow silo to investigate the kinematics of the flowing sand. The measurements were carried out for granular flow in model silos without inserts and in a funnel flow silo equipped with three different types of inserts: cone-in-cone, inverted cone and double cone. The effect of the initial sand density and roughness of silo walls on the volumetric and deviatoric strain in sand was investigated. The accuracy of measurements was discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of PIV were outlined.

	abstract     = {Practical Process Control (loop tuning and troubleshooting). This book differs from others on the market in several respects. First, the presentation is totally in the time domain (the word "LaPlace" is nowhere to be found). The focus of the book is actually troubleshooting, not tuning. If a controller is "tunable", the tuning procedure will be straightforward and uneventful. But if a loop is "untunable", difficulties will be experienced, usually early in the tuning effort. The nature of any difficulty provides valuable clues to what is rendering the loop "untunable". For example, if reducing the controller gain leads to increased oscillations, one should look for possible interaction with one or more other loops. Tuning difficulties are always symptoms of other problems; effective troubleshooting involves recognizing the clues, identifying the root cause of the problem, and making corrections.  Furthermore, most loops are rendered "untunable" due to some aspect of the steady-state behavior of the process. Consequently, the book focuses more on the relationship of process control to steady-state process characteristics than to dynamic process characteristics. One prerequisite to effective troubleshooting is to "demystify" some of the characteristics of the PID control equations. One unique aspect of this book is that it explains in the time domain all aspects of the PID control equation (including as the difference between the parallel and series forms of the PID, the reset feedback form of the PID equation, reset windup protection, etc.) The book stresses an appropriate P\&I (process and instrumentation) diagram as critical to successful tuning. If the P\&I is not right, tuning difficulties are inevitable. Developing and analyzing P\&I diagrams is a critical aspect of troubleshooting.},

	abstract     = {The residence time distribution (RTD) of solids is essential for the design of CFB reactors where conversion proceeds with time. The residence time distribution for the solids is measured at di!erent working conditions. The resulting average residence times are correlated as function of gas velocity and solids circulation rate and are compared with literature data. In order to predict the RTD of the solids, the solids/gas \#ow is "rstly described by a plug \#ow with dispersion. A "tting procedure gave experimental PeH clet numbers, which were correlated as function of gas velocity and solids circulation rate. A more fundamental approach based on the core/annulus \#ow structure is thereafter used to predict the residence time. The riser is divided in a dilute core with particles \#owing upward and a denser "lm moving slowly downward along the wall. Particle interchange between the two regions is described by a convective interchange \#ow. The model is used to predict experimental RTD-curves. The interchange \#ux between core and annulus corresponds well with radial \#uxes reported in literature. Although the RTD is qualitatively well described, experimental curves show a higher dispersion than the calculated ones. To improve the core/annulus approach, further research is necessary. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Design modifications such as incorporating perforations of varying size and different shapes of serrations are introduced to a standard Sulzer SMX geometry. CFD simulations are performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software to investigate mixing performance in these mixers under laminar flow conditions with an incompressible fluid as a working medium. For dispersive mixing, computational results were compared in terms of velocity field, pressure field, shear rate and extensional efficiency of each type of static mixer. Further, binary cluster particle tracer simulations in the flow domain are performed to compute the distributive mixing capacity of these static mixers which is quantified in terms of the standard deviation. Based on the computational results of both dispersive mixing and distributive mixing, the best modified static mixer geometry is proposed which facilitates significantly improved mixing compared to that of a standard SMX geometry.},

Voidage distributions and solids flow structure were investigated using optical fibre probes in a fluidized bed of FCC. The results show a relatively dense annular region, in which the time-average flow is downwards, surrounding a more dilute, upward flowing core region. However, the radial profiles of voidage indicate that the voidage increases gradually from the wall to the axis of the column, rather than showing a sharp transition between an annular and core region. Particles in the descending outer region are entrained by the feed jets into the core region. The radial position of the boundary between upward and downward net solids flow did not change significantly when the superficial gas velocity was varied.},

	abstract     = {A new pressure drop correlation in a Kenics static mixer has been developed. Pressure drop data were generated from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations, avoiding the experimental limitations in obtaining comprehensive data enough for developing a reliable pressure drop correlation. Dimensional analysis reveals that the pressure drop characteristic of the Kenics static mixer can be described by three dimensionless groups, i.e., the friction factor, Reynolds number (Re), and aspect ratio of a mixing element (AR). A systematic graphical analysis led to a single master curve governing the pressure drop behavior of the Kenics static mixer, which had never been achieved before. We derived a pressure drop correlation fitting well with the obtained master curve in a general form into which the AR effect on the pressure drop is directly incorporated. Unlike the already existing correlations available in the literature, the correlation proposed in this study can cover the whole range of Re from laminar to turbulence. The reliability of the proposed correlation was validated by the comparison with various pressure drop data reported in the literature.},

Lots of information is needed in designing these systems, this is not however always available for first conceptual design. The main focus in this project was on developing competence and readiness to conduct reliably but rapidly conceptual techno-economic assessments of (bio)chemical production processes. The idea was to develop a rapid method and a generic “short-cut” model for evaluation of different alternative separation systems mainly for solid-liquid and liquid-liquid systems, but also for gas-liquid and gas-solid systems. The model was created with Balas® simulation software linked with MS Excel. The description of the model is presented in PowerPoint slides, ChemSep – report slides. This document, instead, acts as a theory source for the use of the model. In this document, the classification of separation processes into heterogeneous and homogeneous separation processes is presented, different unit operations of separation are shortly described and the possible application examples are listed. Heterogeneous separation processes that are described in detail include decantation, hydrocyclones, settling, sedimentation, flotation, centrifugal separation, filtration, wet scrubbers, leaching/washing and solid drying. Homogeneous separation processes that are described in detail include flash vaporization, distillation, drying of solutions, evaporation, crystallization and membrane technology. The operational principles, equipment types, selection of appropriate equipment and applications for each above mentioned separation process are described. The theory of the calculation of mass and energy balance in each unit operation are excluded. It can easily be found in the literature. Also, a short chapter of criteria affecting the selection of a suitable separation process for the mixture in question is presented.},

This condition is useful in situations where the ow rate is known, or more importantly, in cases where the pressure gradient is not known a priori, such as in countercurrent ows. Using the present condition, the ow rate is imposed at the inlet in terms of a bulk velocity, but the velocity ÿeld evolves as part of the solution. The condition is formulated to be suitable for both ÿxed and moving periodic domains. For the case of a moving domain, a correction is introduced to account for changes in the instantaneous velocity through the periodic edges. Under periodic conditions, these corrections integrate to zero over a complete (temporal) period. The new periodic condition is shown to produce accurate results for at and wavy-walled channels under both induced ow and countercurrent conditions. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract     = {When a solid object impacts on the surface of a liquid, extremely high pressure develops at the site of contact. Von Karman’s study of this classical physics problem showed that the pressure on the bottom surface of the impacting body approaches infinity for flat impacts. Yet, in contrast to the high pressures found from experience and in previous studies, we show that a flat-bottomed cylinder impacting a pool of liquid can decrease the local pressure sufficiently to cavitate the liquid. Cavitation occurs because the liquid is slightly compressible and impact creates large pressure waves that reflect from the free surface to form negative pressure regions. We find that an impact velocity as low as \textasciitilde 3 m/s suffices to cavitate the liquid and propose a new cavitation number to predict cavitation onset in low-speed solid-liquid impact-scenarios. These findings imply that localized cavitation could occur in impacts such as boat slamming, cliff jumping, and ocean landing of spacecraft.},

	abstract     = {The local gas velocity and the intensity of the gas turbulence in a gas/solid flow are a required measurement in validating the gas and solids flow structure predicted by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models in fluid bed and transport reactors. The high concentration and velocities of solids, however, make the use of traditional gas velocity measurement devices such as pitot tubes, hot wire anemometers and other such devices difficult. A method of determining these velocities has been devised at the National Energy Technology Laboratory employing tracer gas. The technique developed measures the time average local axial velocity gas component of a gas/solid flow using an injected tracer gas which induces changes in the heat transfer characteristics of the gas mixture. A small amount of helium is injected upstream a known distance from a self-heated thermistor. The thermistor, protected from the solids by means of a filter, is exposed to gases that are continuously extracted from the flow. Changes in the convective heat transfer characteristics of the gas are indicated by voltage variations across a Wheatstone bridge. When pulsed injections of helium are introduced to the riser flow the change in convective heat transfer coefficient of the gas can be rapidly and accurately determined with this instrument. By knowing the separation distance between the helium injection point and the thermistor extraction location as well as the time delay between injection and detection, the gas velocity can easily be calculated. Variations in the measured gas velocities also allow the turbulence intensity of the gas to be estimated.},

	abstract     = {A frictional – kinetic rheological model for dense assemblies of solids in a gas – particle mixture is described. This model treats the kinetic and frictional stresses additively. The former is modeled using the kinetic theory of granular materials. For the latter, we begin with the model described by Schaeffer [J. Differ. Equ. 66 (1987) 19] and modify it to account for strain rate fluctuations and slow relaxation of the assembly to the yield surface. Results of simulations of two model problems, namely, the gravity discharge of particles from a bin and the rise of a bubble in a fluidized bed, are presented. The simulations capture the height-independent rate of discharge of particles from the bin, the dilation of particle assembly near the exit orifice, the significant effect of the interstitial air on the discharge behavior of fine particles and the occurrence of pressure deficit above the orifice. However, the stagnant shoulder at the bottom corners of the bin is not captured; instead, one obtains a region of slow flow at the corners. The bubble rise example shows the significant effect of frictional stresses on the bubble shape. In both examples, a simplified version of the rheological model obtained by invoking a critical state hypothesis is found to be adequate.},

The flow of zinc particles, of size 0.4, 0.61 and 0.76 mm size, in a flatbottomed two-dimensional hopper was measured by PIV. The particles were characterized using ASTM procedures for angle of repose, packing density and flow rate through a funnel. Through PIV, velocities and mass flow rates were determined for exit apertures 5 and 7.5 mm in width and 10, 30 and 50 mm long. The bed of particles in the hopper showed the expected stagnant zones on either side of the aperture.

An analysis, based on a theoretical relation derived by HINZE, shows that the main contributions to the pressure drop come from: (1) The static hold-up of solids in the riser. (2) The friction of the solids at the wall. (3) The acceleration of the solids. From this theoretical relation and the experimental data an empirical relationship is established which contains all characteristic variables. The pressure drop across the riser proves not to depend on the viscosity or on the density of the transport gas within the ranges studied (viscosity: l\&37 x 10-B Nsec/m2; density: 0.33-5.0 kg/m3).},

Helium (He) was used as tracer gas, and the local He-concentration was determined by a mass spectrometer. The \#uidisation velocity ranged from 1.2 to 4.3 m/s in the boiler and from 1 to 6 m/s in the cold unit. The bed material was silica sand with an average particle diameter of 0.32 mm in both units. Measurements were also carried out in the bottom bed and splash zone of the boiler for comparison with those of the transport zone. In the cold experimental unit, a greater range of operating conditions could be covered than what was possible in the boiler, including a case without solids. In the core of the transport region of the boiler, there is no backmixing of gas and the horizontal mixing of injected tracer gas is characterised by an axi-symmetric spread of tracer gas around the centre line of injection. The horizontal gas-mixing rate is quanti"ed by a dispersion coe\$cient, which is above 0.01 m /s in the boiler and around 0.005 m /s in the cold unit. The di!erence in dispersion coe\$cients of the boiler and the cold unit is due to the di!erence in size.

	abstract     = {A force balance is derived for a hemispherical particle in the viscous boundary layer at the wall of a horizontal pipe conveying Newtonian uid; the hemisphere, of radius much less than that of the pipe, rests on the bottom with its at face against the wall. The drag on the hemisphere is calculated from the creeping ow ÿeld of Price (Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. Pt. 1 (1993)). This yields a prediction of the maximum velocity gradient at the wall for equilibrium, with limiting friction between the hemisphere and the wall. It is shown that the ow ÿeld of Price predicts a zero lift force but the validity of this, for actual ows, is questioned. Use of a hemisphere formulates a relevant well-posed problem, capable of mathematical solution. However, the ow ÿeld around real particles, e.g. sand, is complex, because of their irregular shapes, but the hemisphere work gives a qualitative indication of the behaviour of irregular particles. For turbulent ow in a pipe it is pertinent to consider a particle wholly within the viscous sub-layer, because it is isolated from signiÿcant turbulence and therefore hard to move; for such ow, the theory gives Eq. (21) to predict the critical pipe velocity, vC , for incipient motion of the hemisphere. For laminar ow, the wall shear rate is readily obtained from the parabolic velocity proÿle leading to Eq. (26) for vC . The ow ÿeld of Price (and therefore the force acting on the hemisphere) is valid only for creeping ow (i.e. very low particle Reynolds number). Modiÿcations to the force balance are tentatively suggested to account for inertial components to the drag force. The predictions of critical velocity are tested against our data for the incipient motion of small hemispheres at pipe walls in hydraulic conveying as well as new and previously published data for both hydraulic and pneumatic conveying. The new method of predicting incipient motion works well for both the pneumatic and hydraulic conveying of hemispheres and sand shaped particles but it overpredicts the critical velocity for more rounded particles. The dependency of critical velocity on particle shape is under-researched.},

In order to include the effects of fine-grain surface roughness, the present study extends a more fundamental work by Craft et al. [Craft, T.J., Gerasimov, A.V., Iacovides, H., Launder, B.E., 2002. Progress in the generalisation of wall-function treatment. Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 23, 148–160] on the development of advanced wall-functions of general applicability. The presently proposed model is validated through comparisons with data available for internal flows through channels and for external flows over flat and curved plates with both smooth and rough surfaces. Then, its further validation in separating flows over a sand dune and a sand-roughened ramp is discussed. The validation results suggest that the presently proposed form can be successfully applied to a wide range of attached and separated turbulent flows with heat transfer over smooth and fine-grain rough surfaces.},

	abstract     = {A two-dimensional (2D) lattice Boltzmann-based model is developed to simulate solutal dendritic growth of binary alloys in the presence of forced flow. The model adopts the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) that describes transport phenomena by the evolution of distribution functions of moving pseudoparticles to numerically solve fluid flow and solute transport governed by both convection and diffusion. Based on the LBM-calculated solutal field, the dynamics of dendritic growth is determined according to a previously proposed local solutal equilibrium approach. After detailed model analysis and validation, the model is applied to simulate single and equiaxed multidendritic growth of Al–Cu alloys with forced convection. The results demonstrate the quantitative, numerically stable and computationally efficient capabilities of the proposed model. It is found that the solute distribution and dendritic growth are strongly influenced by convection, producing asymmetrical dendrites that grow faster in the upstream direction, but mostly slower in the downstream direction.},

Most of the previous studies on this topic were conducted in the singlephase framework which is incapable of considering the effect of fog formation. LNG importing and exporting terminals are typically located at coastal areas where there is a high chance of fog formation. In this study, a multiphase CFD model has been developed to investigate the dynamic mixing of cryogenic LNG vapour cloud and ambient air. The effect of fog formation on LNG vapour dispersion was studied. The model was validated by historical experiments conducted by LLNL, upon which good agreements were achieved. Case studies of different relative humidity were performed in order to investigate the LNG vapour dispersion behaviour affected by different fog concentrations. It was found that the affected area of the vapour dispersion is enlarged if the air relative humidity is increased. The findings in this study could improve the understanding of the mechanism of LNG vapour dispersion in humid environments, and help to provide more reliable risk assessments for LNG plants.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling combined with single-phase (dry) and irrigated (multiphase) experiments were carried out to validate the CFD modelling results. Experiments were conducted to measure the dry and wet pressure drop at a range of liquid load (0–38.2 m3/m2∙h) and F-factor (0–1.2 Pa0.5). Liquid distribution was measured using Wire Mesh Sensor (WMS) for SpiroPak and compared with a commercial and 3D printed replica of Mellpak 250X and Montzpak B1–500. The topology of the packing was analysed to calculate the specific surface area that could be available for mass transfer. It was found that the SpiroPak can have up to 50\textasciitilde 200\% more surface area per unit volume when compared with commercial packing. Experimental and modelling results showed that SpiroPak could reduce the dry pressure drop by approximately 50\%. Parametric study found that reducing corrugation size to increase surface area and increasing the gap size to reduce the pressure drop were key design parameters of SpiroPak. Finally, scale-up and scale-out (tessellation) techniques were compared to determine the optimum element size for the application of SpiroPak on a large scale.},

The enol structure was unsteady in alkaline environment so that Li+ can be selectively extracted by taking the place of hydroxyl hydrogen. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of TOPO intensified the extraction ability by the generation of strong electrostatic. Based on the calculated Gibbs energy changes, the parameters of extraction efficiency and separation factor were analyzed and they had qualitative consistence with the experimental results. Meanwhile, it was determined that the electron-withdrawing effect of the subsistent group in the β-diketones had a critical influence on the extraction separation performance. Besides, the theoretical model predicted successfully the transition of extraction complex from hydrophilicity to lipophilicity after the combination with synergistic reagent.},

	abstract     = {Biodiesel, with its nature of clean, biodegradability, and renewability, is an ideal substitute for fossil diesel. This critical review focuses on the advances in process intensification of biodiesel production by the emerging hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) technology. The recent progress in HC reactors and HC-assisted biodiesel production are summarized and discussed. Several key operating factors (i.e., reactor structure, cavitation intensity, temperature, molar ratio of alcohol to oil, catalyst, and duration) and the economic feasibility are analyzed. It is found that HC can effectively enhance acid- and alkali-catalyzed production processes by using various edible and non-edible oils (e.g., waste cooking oil) as feedstocks, and have economic practicability for industrialization. HC can achieve as high as over 99\% yields in a short time, and the quality of the high-purity products meets EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. Although the process simulation and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) validated that the economics of HC process is far superior to that of conventional mechanical stirring at large scales, the experimental research at pilot or industrial scales is absent, and the amplification effect of both the reactor and process is unclear. Moreover, the investigations on the cavitation flow mechanism, structural optimization and design of HCRs, and feasibility (e.g., life cycle analysis (LCA), LCCA, and LCA-LCCA), have to be focused on in the future. At last, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of the HC process are evaluated by a SWOT matrix, which may hopefully provide some inspiration for the future development of this novel technology.},

In dilute particle-laden turbulent flows, we see a need for more realistic descriptions of particle–fluid and particle–particle interactions that would ultimately be suitable for incorporation in large eddy simulations. Experiments are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which particles modulate turbulence. Progress in computer simulation methods and kinetic-theory analyses are leading to new opportunities to obtain the equations of motion for more concentrated multiphase flows which are strongly influenced by or dominated by the disperse phase. However, instabilities inherent to the multiphase nature of these flows lead to the very complex behavior of industrial scale multiphase flows. We require a better understanding of these instabilities as well as coarse-grained models for the average multiphase flows at larger scales. A major issue in dense granular flows is to elucidate the manner in which particle–particle frictional interactions can lead either to mixing or segregation of different particle species.},

	abstract     = {The breakdown of the no-slip condition at fluid–solid interfaces generates a host of interesting fluid-dynamical phenomena. In this paper, we consider such a scenario by investigating the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics of a novel ‘slip–stick’ spherical particle whose surface is partitioned into slip and no-slip regions. In the limit where the slip length is small compared to the size of the particle, we first compute the translational velocity of such a particle due to the force density on its surface. Subsequently, we compute the rotational velocity and the response to an ambient straining field of a slip–stick particle. These three Faxén-type formulae are rich in detail about the dynamics of the particles: chiefly, we find that the translational velocity of a slip–stick sphere is coupled to all of the moments of the force density on its surface; furthermore, such a particle can migrate parallel to the velocity gradient in a shear flow. Perhaps most important is the coupling we predict between torque and translation (and force and rotation), which is uncharacteristic of spherical particles in unbounded Stokes flow and originates purely from the slip–stick asymmetry.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results from a commercial CFD software package, Fluent, were compared to those obtained by experiments conducted in a fluidized bed containing spherical glass beads of 250–300 m in diameter. A multifluid Eulerian model incorporating the kinetic theory for solid particles was applied in order to simulate the gas–solid flow. Momentum exchange coefficients were calculated using the Syamlal–O’Brien, Gidaspow, and Wen–Yu drag functions. The solid-phase kinetic energy fluctuation was characterized by varying the restitution coefficient values from 0.9 to 0.99. The modeling predictions compared reasonably well with experimental bed expansion ratio measurements and qualitative gas–solid flow patterns. Pressure drops predicted by the simulations were in relatively close agreement with experimental measurements at superficial gas velocities higher than the minimum fluidization velocity, Umf . Furthermore, the predicted instantaneous and time-average local voidage profiles showed similarities with the experimental results. Further experimental and modeling efforts are required in a comparable time and space resolutions for the validation of CFD models for fluidized bed reactors. ᭧ 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, HCPs have experienced rapid growth due to their remarkable advantages such as diverse synthetic methods, easy functionalization, high surface area, low cost reagents and mild operating conditions. Judicious selection of monomers, appropriate length crosslinkers and optimized reaction conditions yielded a well-developed polymer framework with an adjusted porous topology. Post fabrication of the as developed network facilitates the incorporation of various chemical functionalities that may lead to interesting properties and enhance the selection toward a specific application. To date, numerous HCPs have been prepared by post-crosslinking polystyrene-based precursors, one-step self-polycondensation or external crosslinking strategies. The advent of these methodologies has prompted researchers to construct well-defined porous polymer networks with customized micromorphology and functionalities. In this review, we describe not only the basic synthetic principles and strategies of HCPs, but also the advancements in the structural and morphological study as well as the frontiers of potential applications in energy and environmental fields such as gas storage, carbon capture, removal of pollutants, molecular separation, catalysis, drug delivery, sensing etc.},

In response, a migration-based framework is proposed in this paper for battery modeling, in which the effects of temperature and aging are treated as uncertainties. An accurate model for a fresh cell is established first and then migrated to the degraded batteries through a Bayes Monte Carlo method. Experiments are carried out on both LiFePO4 batteries and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3) O2 batteries under various ambient temperatures and aging levels. The results indicate that the typical voltage prediction error can be limited within ±20 mV, for the cases of temperature change up to 40 °C, and capacity degradation up to 20\%. The proposed method paves ways to an effective battery management and energy control for electric vehicles or micro grid applications.},

Due to its importance an ability to effectively extract sulforaphane from its source is desirable. This work investigated the feasibility of using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) to extract sulforaphane from cabbages. The effects of various parameters, which are the type of solvent (dichloromethane and water), set microwave power (130, 260 and 390W) and extraction time, on the extraction yield of sulforaphane were investigated. In addition, since it was previously shown that partially dried cabbages contain higher sulforaphane content than fresh cabbages, the effect of partial drying prior to MAE on the extractable amount of sulforaphane was investigated. A comparison between MAE and conventional extraction was also made. The results showed that MAE was more effective than the conventional extraction as the former led to higher yield of sulforaphane in a much shorter extraction time. There were no significant differences in the highest extractable sulforaphane contents from the fresh and semi-dried samples. Use of different solvents also did not lead to any significant effect on the MAE of sulforaphane, either from the fresh or semi-dried sample.},

	abstract     = {Chemical and mechanical engineers are quite familiar with concepts of fluid flow which include mass and momentum balances and constitutive equations which contain such material characteristics as viscosity and density. Combination of the above correlations yields the well-known Navier-Stokes equations which have to be solved to obtain details of the flow field; a large number of analytical solutions of these equations exist. Somewhat similar equations have been develeped for granular materials moving in the rapid granular flow regime, i.e. in the regime in which particle-particle contacts are not very extensive and hence friction is not prevalent. These equations result from a similarity between the movement ot molecules and the flow of small elastic (or elasto-plastie) particles and resemble, for certain limiting eases, the fluid flowequations. Slow, frictional flowsof powders are different in that particles are in contact for extended periods of time and friction is the overwhelming interaction. Flow in this regime is governed by the same mass and momentum balances but the constitutive equations are different. Only very recently have some of these equations been combined to yield a set of differential equations which take the place of the Navier-Stokes equations; only very few solutions of these equations exist. The present paper describes common features and major dissimilarities between different equations of motion for the above systems and some of their solutions and presents examples and comparisons of powder and fluid flows in identical geometries. Furthermore, general equations of motion for compressible powders in slow flow are developed and an example of an analytical s\textasciitilde lution is given.},

The values of n and m depend on the bed compositions and particle size; they become smaller at higher gas velocities. For FCC, n has an average value of 4.0 in the velocity range 0.2–0.4 m/s and tends to a value of 2 at higher gas velocities.

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is a unit that converts heavy distillates like gas oil or residues to gasoline and middle distillates using cracking catalyst. About 45\% of worldwide gasoline production comes from FCC processes and its ancillary units. Since a typical FCC unit can process a large amount of the feedstock into more valuable products, the overall economic benefits of a refining could be considerably increased if proper control and optimization strategies are implemented. FCC processes are known to be very difficult to model and control because of the large process scale, complicated hydro-dynamics and complex kinetics of both cracking and coke burning reactions. One of the more heavily investigated terms of nonlinear control, in the field of “intelligent control”, is that due to fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). FLCs have been successfully applied to a stream of difficult, nonlinear dynamical process such as FCC. Here, with an application to a Turkish refinery FCC unit of FLC fuzzy results obtained using Matlab-Fuzzy Logic Toolbox version 6.5 were found to be acceptable. The paper indicates how fuzzy logic control (FLC), as a promising control technique, would be effectively used for improved process control of FCC in refinery process industry.},

In the first frame of the user interface input form, users are prompted to enter independent and dependent variables in the ODE. On the other hand, they are needed to input the interval for the independent variables, initial value for the dependent variable, step size h and select the desired accuracy of calculation in the second frame of the user interface input form. Lastly, in the third frame of the user interface input form, users are required to enter the ODE function and exact function of ODE if it exists. Once the Solve button is clicked, the full solution of the ODE will be calculated automatically using the RK4 method. This spreadsheet calculator is user-friendly especially for users who are not familiar with Excel.

	abstract     = {Purpose of review~         This article recounts the history of the diet-heart hypothesis from the late 1950s up to the current day, with revelations that have never before been published in the scientific literature. These novel insights include the role of authorities in launching the diet-hypothesis, including a potential conflict of interest for the American Heart Association; a number of crucial details regarding studies considered influential to the hypothesis; irregularities in the scientific reviews on saturated fats, for both the 2015 and 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans; and possible conflicts of interest on the relevant subcommittee reviewing saturated fats for the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. Information obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on emails from the 2015 process is published here for the first time. These findings are highly relevant to the 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines process, now underway, which has plans for a new review on saturated fats.         Recent findings~         Recent findings include shortcomings in the scientific review processes on saturated fats, for both the current 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the previous edition (2015–2020). Revelations include the fact that the publication of a book in the lay press triggered a new review of saturated fats for the 2015 Dietary Guidelines and that the Chair of the 2015 Advisory Committee acknowledged, in an e-mail, the lack of scientific justification for any specific numeric cap on these fats. Other, previously unpublished findings include significant potential financial conflicts on the relevant 2020 guidelines subcommittee, including the participation of plant-based advocates, an expert who promotes a plant-based diet for religious reasons, experts who had received extensive funding from industries, such as tree nuts and soy, whose products benefit from continued policy recommendations favoring polyunsaturated fats, and one expert who had spent more than 50 years of her career dedicated to ‘proving’ the diet-heart hypothesis.         Summary~         The idea that saturated fats cause heart disease, called the diet-heart hypothesis, was introduced in the 1950s, based on weak, associational evidence. Subsequent clinical trials attempting to substantiate this hypothesis could never establish a causal link. However, these clinical-trial data were largely ignored for decades, until journalists brought them to light about a decade ago. Subsequent reexaminations of this evidence by nutrition experts have now been published in {$>$}20 review papers, which have largely concluded that saturated fats have no effect on cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality or total mortality. The current challenge is for this new consensus on saturated fats to be recognized by policy makers, who, in the United States, have shown marked resistance to the introduction of the new evidence. In the case of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines, experts have been found even to deny their own evidence. The global re-evaluation of saturated fats that has occurred over the past decade implies that caps on these fats are not warranted and should no longer be part of national dietary guidelines. Conflicts of interest and longstanding biases stand in the way of updating dietary policy to reflect the current evidence.},

	abstract     = {The drag force term appearing in two-fluid models for fluid–particle flows is commonly closed by expressing it as a function of the local quantities, such as the local particle volume fraction, the local slip velocity between the particle and fluid phases, and the local mean-squared fluctuating velocity of the particles. The adequacy of such closures for inhomogeneous suspensions has been debated in the literature and some researchers have suggested the need for additional terms involving spatial gradients in these quantities. To test this proposition, simulations of flow in inhomogeneous steady beds of particles have been performed using the lattice-Boltzmann method. The particle beds consisted of disordered assemblies with a density profile on a scale much larger than the particle radius. Inhomogeneous beds with a controlled density profile were generated in three different ways, (i) by inhomogeneous stretching of the particle bed in one direction, (ii) by applying an inhomogeneous force to the particle phase during random motion of the particles, and (iii) by taking snapshots of a direct simulation of a traveling wave in a fluidization simulation. The global structure of the three beds was comparable, while assessment of the radial distribution functions showed that the three beds exhibited clearly different microscopic structures. The force profiles along the inhomogeneous direction of the particle bed were obtained from the flow simulations. These were analyzed by applying spatial averaging in a manner identical to the averaging procedure that is used to derive the two-fluid model equations. The force profiles were compared to predictions based on flow simulations of homogeneous disordered particle beds over a range of volume fractions. To assess the role of the microstructure of the particle bed also simulations were executed where the homogeneous disordered bed was modified by either applying homogeneous stretching or by applying a lubrication force during generation of the particle bed.},

There is an increasing need for developing new ways of producing emulsions on demand having desired critical quality attributes. Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), which is a process of generation, growth and collapse of vapour cavities leading to intense localised shear and energy dissipation, offers an attractive platform for producing emulsions. In this work, we present experimental and computational results of a breakage of a single oil drop injected in a HC device. A single drop of oil was injected in a continuous stream of demineralised water flowing through a vortex based HC device. Tween 20 surfactant (2\%) was used to prevent coalescence. The droplet size distribution (DSD) at the outlet of HC device was characterised using the imaging method. A detailed 3D computational model was developed to simulate turbulent cavitating flow through the considered HC device and resulting drop breakage and droplet size distribution. The developed model was used to quantitatively relate Sauter mean diameter (d32) and droplet size distribution (DSD) at the outlet with the operating parameters of the HC device. A single-pass through the vortex based HC device was able to bring down droplet size from ∼103~µm to ∼101~µm. The data and the model discussed in this work will provide a systematic basis for developing models, cavitation devices and operating protocols to produce emulsions with desired DSD.},

There is an increasing need for developing compact and modular devices for producing emulsions with desired droplet size distribution (DSD). In this work, we have experimentally and computationally investigated an application of vortex-based hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) device for producing emulsions. The focus is on understanding drop breakage occurring in a single-pass through the considered HC device. The experiments were performed for generating oil-in-water emulsion containing 1\%–20\% rapeseed oil. The effect of pressure drop across the HC device in the range of 50–250 kPa on drop breakage was examined. DSD of emulsions produced through a single pass was measured using the focussed beam reflectance measurements. Comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the Eulerian approach was developed to simulate multiphase cavitating flow. Using the simulated flow, population balance model (PBM) with appropriate breakage kernels was solved to simulate droplet breakage in a vortex-based HC device. The device showed an excellent drop breakage efficiency (nearly 1\% which is much higher than other commercial devices such as rotor–stators or sonolators) and was able to reduce mean drop size from 66 to 15 μm in a single pass. The CFD and PBM models were able to simulate DSD. The presented models and results will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in developing compact devices for producing emulsions of desired DSD.},

The numerical simulation revealed that wall roughness significantly reduced the ‘particle free zone’ and smoothed the particle number density profiles by altering the particle rebounding behaviours. It was also found that wall roughness reduced the particle mean velocities and also increased the particle fluctuating velocities in both streamwise and transverse directions.},

The acquired flow regime information can be used for improved measurement accuracy on gas volume fractions, and as complementary information for other types of flow instrumentation, in order to enhance their accuracy. The work presented in this paper includes both theoretical calculations and experimental work on three-phase flow using multibeam gamma-ray densitometry. It is demonstrated that a fan beam geometry with one radiation source and several collimated detectors is sufficient to provide information on the liquid–gas distribution of the pipe flow. In order to perform testing on deviated multiphase oil, water and gas flows, a special tilt section was designed and built. Several different flow regimes were successfully identified from the acquired experimental measurement data.

Although EIT systems have often been applied to yield qualitative information about gas–solid flows, the present EIT system yields quantitative information that is validated by comparison to a gamma densitometry tomography (GDT) system. EIT and GDT were applied to the CFB riser (14-cm inner diameter, 5.77-m height) containing fluid catalytic cracking particles in air. The flows examined were annular with a dilute core and had average and near-wall solids volume fractions up to 0.25 and 0.66, respectively. For all cases, the average and near-wall solids volume fractions from EIT and GDT agreed to within 0.03 and 0.07, respectively. This good agreement suggests that, where feasible, EIT can be used in place of GDT, which is advantageous since EIT systems are often safer, less expensive, and faster than GDT systems.},

It has become increasingly more important to develop good, and theoretically sound models for scaling up and design of the reactors. The most common models used today rely heavily upon empirical information obtainable only from pilot size experiments and this makes “a priori” design from small scale data difficult. The model presented is based on a “first principles” approach where the parameters are fundamental in nature and as far as possible, obtainable from general fluid dynamics literature. It is a dynamic two phase model incorporating a k-ε turbulence model, compressible gas phase and axisymmetry. The equations are discretisized using a finite volume technique with an upwind or hybrid differencing scheme and solved using a variation of the SIMPLE (Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) method. The results from simulations of a two-phase bubble column are compared with measured radial distributions of gas hold-up, liquid velocity and turbulent kinetic energy using air and desalinated water as media. As chemical reaction, the production of methanol from synthesis gas is implemented. Simulation results using a pseudohomogenous 3-phase slurry model are compared with data from literature.},

Measurements of the drag coefficients are reported in this paper for six different geometrical shapes, including isometric, axisymmetric, orthotropic, plane and elongated conglomerates of spheres. From these measurements, a new and accurate empirical correlation for the drag coefficient, CD, of variously shaped particles has been developed. This correlation has been formulated in terms of the Reynolds number based on the particle nominal diameter, Re, the ratio of the surface-equivalent-sphere to the nominal diameters, dA/dn, and the particle circularity, c. The predictions have been tested against both the experimental data for CD collected in this study and the ones reported in previous works for cubes, rectangular parallelepipeds, tetrahedrons, cylinders and other shapes. A good agreement has been observed for the variously shaped agglomerates of spheres as well as for the regularly shape particles, over the ranges 0.15 {$<$} Re {$<$} 1500, 0.80 {$<$} dA/dn {$<$} 1.50 and 0.4 {$<$} c {$<$} 1.0.},

The methodology is investigated using the example of the control of dispersity and molecular weight distribution in a batch reactor for emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate. An artifical neural network (ANN) is used as a model to predict the quality as a function of the manipulated variables and on-line measurements. This model is constructed using an augmented dataset that integrates experimental information and knowledge from a mathematical model. The proposed model is compared with other types such as a theoretical model whose key parameters are fitted to experimental data. The hybrid ANN is superior to the parameter-fitting approach for this case.

Second, calculated results based on the discrete particle model are compared with the results of Tsuo and Gidaspow (AIChE J., 36 (6) (1990) 885) who used the two-fluid model to predict cluster patterns in the riser of a circulating fluidized bed. Following Tsuo and Gidaspow, parametric studies were conducted, that is, the effects of gas velocity, solids mass flux, particle size and duct size on flow patterns were studied. Quantitatively, a large difference is observed between the results of both models. For instance, the cluster population is much larger in the discrete particle model than in the twofluid model. Qualitatively, both results exhibit the same tendencies in most cases. However, concerning the effect of duct size, even the qualitative results are different: the discrete particle model shows that as the duct size increases, clusters are formed not only near the wall but also in the central part of the duct, while the two-fluid model gives the result that clusters disappear in a wide duct as the duct size increases. The present authors neglect fluid viscosity and thus the results are not satisfactory near the wall. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

	abstract     = {First, gas–particle flows are classified based on particle–particle interaction. Next, methods of numerical analysis of gas–particle flows are classified based on the concept of length scale. That is, the methods are classified into micro-, meso- and macro-scale approaches. The scalebased classification is applied to gas-phase and particulate phase, respectively. Most of existing models of multiphase flows are categorized into one of the combination of scale-based models for gas and particles. After the classification, description focuses on the discrete particle simulation which belongs to the micro-scale approach for the particle phase. The advantage of the particle–micro approach is to deal with particle–particle interaction in the rational way. To treat the particle-to-particle interaction mathematically, techniques named DEM (Distinct Element Method) and DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) have been developed. DEM is a powerful means for the contact-dominated flows and DSMC method for the collision-dominated flows. Combining DEM or DSMC with CFD (computer fluid dynamics), applications of the discrete particle simulation have drastically expanded into many industrial flows because both particle-to-particle and particle-to-fluid interactions have significant effects on most industrial flows. Various examples of simulations are shown; such as dense phase pneumatic conveying, spouted bed, fast circulating fluidized bed and so on.},

	abstract     = {Hypercrosslinked polystyrene networks have been recognised since the 1970s. They were prepared by extensive crosslinking of linear polystyrene chains in a strongly solvating media. Generally, the basic principle of obtaining hypercrosslinked polymers consists in the formation of a rigid highly solvated three-dimensional network. Owing to the high rigidity and reduced degree of chain entanglement, such “expanded” networks are characterized by loose chain packing, i.e., high free volume, and the unique ability to swell in both good solvents and non-solvents. In addition to the above polymer-analogues transformation of polystyrene, the article expands the synthesis techniques to polymerization and polycondensation procedures and also involves other types of polymers and monomers. Typical examples of preparing hypercrosslinked networks include the crosslinking of linear chains of polysulfone and polyarylates, copolymerization of styrene with a large amount of divinylbenzene, self-condensation of p-xylylene dichloride. All resulting materials differ substantially from classical polymers of the same chemical nature and comprise a new class of hypercrosslinked polymeric materials. Some polymers described in the literature were shown to also belong to the hypercrosslinked family.},

Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) provide flexibility in use as they are available in the form of powder, granule, and fiber. Superabsorbent fiber is mainly produced by two different ways, i.e. mixing the superabsorbent material with hydrophobic/hydrophilic material or directly using a SAP in fiber spinning with dry or wet spinning technology. Superabsorbent fibers are superior to conventional wood pulp and cotton linter that are superabsorbent by nature and can be blended with natural and synthetic fibers and converted into a wide range of yarn and fabric structures. The global demand for absorbent products continues to increase with the growth of population. This chapter focuses on superabsorbent fibers, their production, test methods, and finally applications together with brief explanation of main principle of superabsorbency and polymer materials.},

This technique has been applied to a variety of multiphase flow reactors largely based on the theoretical framework for optimal design and performance parameters. No systematic evaluation and validation of the design and performance parameters of the RPT technique has been reported in the literature thus far. Consequently, the theoretical framework for the design of RPT experiments has had limited scalability and application to a wide variety of flow systems. Thus far, design of a “good” RPT experiment continues to be an art, no matter how much the richness of flow of information that the experimental method brings. The present work reports systematic experimental evaluation of design parameters for an optimal RPT experiment and validation of the theoretical results reported in literature. The experiments were performed in a carefully designed setup in which precise positioning of the tracer particle was made possible. The experiments assess the effect of various parameters on the performance of the RPT experiment, such as the choice of radioactive isotope, activity, gamma-ray energy, size of the detector, and relative positioning of detectors. Finally, a set of recommendations based on experimental work are provided to “optimally” perform the RPT experiment in any single or multiphase reactor.},

Gas phase catalytic oxidation of benzene was carried out in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor on six different types of catalysts, which have different compositions. Effects of temperature, flow rates of benzene and air and catalyst type on the reaction selectivity were investigated at atmospheric pressure. The experiments were performed over a temperature range of 325 to 400 °C, a space-time (W/FA0) range from 11.28 × 105 to 31.9 × 105 g s mol–1, and benzene/ air mole ratio changes between 0.0109 and 0.0477. It was seen that conversion of benzene to MAN increased with increasing temperature for the catalysts supported by silica gel, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. From the results it was found that conversion increased with increasing flow rate of air. When the comparison of the catalysts were made, it could be said that catalysts supported by silica gel showed higher MAN conversions. So it can be concluded that catalysts supported by silica gel were more suitable catalysts for benzene oxidation to MAN in a fluidized bed reactor.},

	abstract     = {In fluidised bed olefin polymerisation reactors, a liquid monomer is added for enhancing heat removal (super-condensed mode). This broadens the operating window and can substantially increase the capacity of a given reactor hardware. Design and location of liquid injection nozzles play a key role in dictating the performance of condensed mode operations. An understanding of the fundamental characteristics of droplet impingement onto solid particles is critical for proper design. In this paper, we study the interactions between liquid droplets and hot solid surfaces across various boiling regimes. High-speed digital imaging is used to capture the droplet vaporisation process. Water droplets impacting on a solid wall with different Weber numbers are investigated. The effect of various parameters such as surface and initial droplet diameter, liquid velocity and surface tension is studied. Experimental data of dynamic drop impact on a flat hot surface are reported. A phenomenological model is developed to describe the droplet vaporisation phenomena in single phase and nucleate boiling regimes. The results from the phenomenological model are compared with the experimental data presented here and the experimental results reported in the literature. The study provides useful clues for understanding the real case when solid particles are much larger than the injected liquid droplets.},

	abstract     = {Liquid-fluidized beds of noncohesive beads, gas-fluidized beds of noncohesive light beads, and gas-fluidized beds of fine particles are examples of systems exhibiting nonbubbling fluid-like fluidization. In contrast, stable fluid bubbles have been seen to develop continuously in liquid-fluidized beds of high-density beads, gas-fluidized beds of noncohesive beads, and gas-fluidized beds of fine particles at high gas velocities. On the other hand, for slightly cohesive particles bubbling is just restrained by permanent interparticle contacts in a solid-like fluidized bed. The disparity of behavior between these apparently disconnected systems has contributed to feed a longstanding controversy on the mechanism of bubbling suppression in fluidized beds that still persists. In this article, a description of fluidized beds of cohesive powders based on particle agglomeration due to attractive forces is demonstrated. The effects of fluid viscosity and particle size and density on the type of fluidization behavior are investigated. A main finding is that for fluidization of sufficiently fine particles and=or with high-viscosity gas the fluidized bed transits directly from a nonbubbling fluid-like state to elutriation. A review of empirical observations reported in the literature illustrates a Geldart’s diagram modified to consider multistage agglomeration of nanoparticles. The proposed diagram serves to discriminate between the so-called agglomerate particulate fluidization (APF) behavior and agglomerate bubbling fluidization (ABF) behavior on the basis of primary particle size and density.},

In contrast with the expected Geldart C behavior, and due to self-agglomeration, these fine particles are uniformly fluidized by gas in a vertically oriented bed, displaying a fluid-like regime and expanding smoothly as the gas velocity is increased. When the gas flow supply to the bed is suddenly stopped, the initial sedimentation velocity of the vertically oriented bed is similar to the fluidizing gas velocity as corresponds to uniform fluidization. The main effect of inclination is to induce fluidization heterogeneity. The local gas velocity increases in the adjacent region to the upper wall at the expense of the region adjacent to the lower wall. This situation anticipates the onset of local bubbling in the region adjacent to the upper wall. Meanwhile the region adjacent to the lower wall remains in a solid-like state and does not reach the fluid-like state until values of the gas flow are applied much higher than those needed in a vertical fluidized bed. As a consequence, the expansion and fluidization uniformity of the tilted bed are hindered. If the gas supply to the inclined bed is suddenly stopped, and because of induced heterogeneity, sedimentation takes place at a decreased rate as compared with sedimentation velocity in the uniformly fluidized vertical bed.},

	abstract     = {Spout fluidized beds find widespread application in the process industry in granulation processes, in which efficient contacting between large particles, droplets and gas is of paramount importance. However, detailed understanding of the complex behavior of these systems is lacking. In this paper, we study the effect of the inter-particle interaction on the bed dynamics, by investigating the bed dynamics as a function of the restitution coefficient. This is done computationally, with the use of an extended discrete particle model. The examined flow regimes comprise the intermediate/spout-fluidization regime (B1), the spouting-withaeration regime (B2) and the jet-in-fluidized-bed regime (B3). The pressure drop and the vertical particle velocity are compared to experimental data obtained by Link (Chem. Eng. Sci. 2007, 62, 195). The computed results with en = 0.97 show the same resemblance with the experiments. It is shown that, if the restitution coefficient decreases, more bubbles are present causing more pronounced heterogeneity (instability) in the overall flow structure of the bed, to more or less extent dependent on the flow regime. The particle velocity and root mean square profiles confirm the effect on the stability of the bed and show that the spout channel for cases B1 and B3 becomes unstable when the restitution coefficient decreases. For case B2, a transition occurs from the spouting-with-aeration to the intermediate/spout-fluidization regime at low restitution coefficient. These findings show the great importance of the influence of the restitution coefficient on the dynamics of the bed. During the granulation process, when the particles contain different moisture contents, regions in the bed exist that contain particles with different restitution coefficients. These regions thus experience different dynamics, resulting in varying performance.},

	abstract     = {Gas-solid fluidized beds are widely applied in many chemical processes involving physical and/or chemical transformations, and for this reason they are the subject of intense research in chemical engineering science. Over the years, researchers have developed a large number of numerical models of gas-fluidized beds that describe gassolid flow at different levels of detail. In this review, we discriminate these models on the basis of whether a Lagrangian or a Eulerian approach is used for the gas and/or particulate flow and subsequently classify them into five main categories, three of which we discuss in more detail. Specifically, these are resolved discrete particle models (also called direct numerical simulations), unresolved discrete particle models (also called discrete element models), and two-fluid models. For each of the levels of description, we give the general equations of motion and indicate how they can be solved numerically by finite-difference techniques, followed by some illustrative examples of a fluidized bed simulation. Finally, we address some of the challenges ahead in the multiscale modeling of gas-fluidized beds.},

	abstract     = {Recently reported results on the origin, propagation and attenuation of pressure waves in bubbling gas-solid fluidized beds are re-evaluated and the results are compared with additional experiments reported here. It is found that the measured pressure fluctuations are a result of slow and fast propagating pressure waves. Pressure waves with high propagation velocities ( {$>$} 10 m / s) are unambiguously identified as compression waves, which move upwards and downwards. Upward moving compression waves originate from gas bubble formation and gas bubble coalescence. The amplitude of upward moving pressure waves is linearly dependent on the distance to the bed surface. Downward moving compression waves are caused by gas bubble eruptions at the fluidized bed surface, bubble coalescence and by changes in bed voidage. In this case the pressure wave amplitude is independent of the distance to the bed surface. Pressure waves with propagation velocities of less than 2 m/s are caused by rising gas bubbles. These pressure waves move upwards only, with an amplitude proportional to the bubble size. The average wave propagation velocity measured in a freely bubbling bed is lower than that predicted from the pseudo-homogeneous compressible wave theory owing to the presence of slowly rising gas bubbles. The average propagation velocity of pressure waves in a gassolid circulating fluidized bed is adequately described as a function of local voidage by pseudo-homogeneous compressible wave theory. At low voidages in the bottom of the riser, the propagation velocity is lowered by the presence of gas bubbles or large gas voids. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

Time series of pressure fluctuations were recorded at different measurement positions in a lab-scale riser at gas velocities of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0m/s under dilute and dense flow conditions, with solids mass fluxes ranging from 0 to 232kg/m2s. When dense flow conditions are met at the measurement position, two regions with different power-law fall-off are observed in the power spectral density. At dilute flow conditions, no clear regions with a power-law fall-off are observed. The power in region I shows a sharp decrease from a value of ≈2–≈0.5 at the transition from dilute to dense flow at the measurement position. With increasing mass flux, the power increases to a value of approximately 2 again. The power in region II increases from a value of ≈3.5–≈5 for all measurement positions when a dense bed is formed in the bottom section of the riser. With the coherence between measurement positions, it is demonstrated that gas/particle turbulence is a negligible source for pressure fluctuations. Gas velocity fluctuations and solids clusters are the predominant sources for these fluctuations. The power-law fall-off regions are attributed to solids clusters, and explained by the typical triangular or saw-tooth shape of the pressure fluctuations.},

	abstract     = {The hydrodynamics of a compact dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasifier, consisting of a short riser and a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB), designed for high-ash coal, has been investigated. The effects of fluidization numbers from various aeration ports, and secondary aeration (SA) in the riser have been examined on solids circulation rate and solids holdup in the DFB. The performance of solids recycle systems has been investigated for on-bed and in-bed solids discharge from the BFB to the riser resulting in a low- and high- bed density operation in the riser. For high superficial gas velocity and high-density operation of the riser, an intense solids backmixing is noticed near the riser-exit, which decreases when SA is used. SA is found to be more effective in maintaining a proper balance between solids holdup and solids circulation rate when the bottom riser bed is operated in the fast fluidized bed regime for in-bed solids discharge. Acoustic and electrostatic signals were used to detect and analyze the flow regimes transition in vertical pneumatic conveying from the scope of particle motion. It was found that the minimum acoustic energy and electrostatic accumulation appeared close to the minimum transport velocity. Furthermore, analysis of particle velocity based on electrostatic signals demonstrated that negative particle velocities appeared in plug flow since particles fell down between plugs, thus collision between falling particles and plug dominated and the energy fraction of collision increased with the decreasing gas velocity in plug flow. Finally, based on combination of different detection methods, two new flow regimes transition diagrams were developed. The one based on AE energy and pressure drop indicated different relationships between particle-wall interaction and energy loss in different flow regimes, while another one based on the electrostatic accumulation demonstrated the transition zone between the minimum transport velocity and flow regime transition velocity. Dynamic modeling is required to understand hydrodynamics of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser as a function of time. The paper develops a dynamic model of the riser from the conservation of solid mass. Solid mass that flows out of the riser requires particle residence time to close the mass balance equation. The mean residence time of solids was derived as the riser length divided by the superficial riser gas velocity normalized by a ratio of solid concentration in the riser outlet to that in the riser itself. For bed materials including high-density polyethylene beads, glass beads, and cork, the percentage of solid concentration in the horizontal crossover pipe connecting the riser exit and the cyclone inlet was found to be 22\% of the average concentration of solids in the riser. Upon finding the particle residence time, we calculated the solid flow rate out of the riser and along with the knowledge of solids flowing into the riser column we determined the riser inventory as a function of time. We used the estimated solid inventory to model overall pressure drop across the riser from the conservation of momentum. The momentum equation included the balance of pressure force by the hydrostatic head of solids, and the wall frictions due to gas and solids in a fully developed zone. The prediction of overall riser pressure drop compared well with its measured values at many dynamic conditions. Therefore, our dynamic model is useful for developing advanced control strategy or for improving existing control systems of the CFB plant. The residence time approach is also useful for the design of a transport reactor. The technique also comes handy when setting up the boundary condition for the overall pressure drop in the CFD modeling that can simulate incremental pressures along the riser height. Accurate information concerning riser inventory in a fluidized bed is required in some applications such as the calcium looping process, because it is related to the CO2 capture efficiency of the system. In a circulating fluidized bed (CFB), the riser inventory is normally calculated from the riser pressure drop; however, the friction and the acceleration phenomena may have a significant influence on the total riser pressure drop. Therefore, deviation may occur in the calculation from the actual mass. For this reason the magnitude of the friction and the acceleration pressure drop in the entire riser is studied in small-scale risers. Two series of studies were performed: the first one in a scaled cold model riser of the 10 kWth facility, and the second one in the 10 kWth fluidized bed riser under process conditions. The velocities were chosen to comply with the fluidization regimes suitable for the calcium looping process, namely, the turbulent and the fast. In cold-model experiments in a low-velocity turbulent fluidization regime, the actual weight (static pressure drop) of the particles is observed more than the weight calculated from a recorded pressure drop. This phenomenon is also repeated in pilot plant conditions. In the cold-model setup, the friction and acceleration pressure drop became apparent in the fast fluidization regime, and increased as the gas velocity rose. Within calcium looping conditions in the pilot plant operation, the static pressure drop was observed more than the recorded pressure drop. Therefore, as a conservative approach, the influence of friction pressure drop may be neglected while calculating the solid inventory of the riser. The concept of transit inventory is introduced as a fraction of total inventory, which lies in freefall zones of the CFB system. This fraction increases as gas velocity rises. Cluster structures affect macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior in gas–solid risers. The moment and energy balances for the dense phase and dilute phase are presented by the multi-scale resolution approach to investigate the dependence of drag coefficient on structure parameters. The modified model of cluster structure-dependent (CSD) drag coefficient is proposed on the basis of the minimization of energy dissipation by heterogeneous drag (MEDHD). Unlike previous works on CSD drag coefficient model, the modified CSD drag model takes wall friction into account. The closure for the drag coefficient depends not only on flow behavior of gas and particles but also on the wall friction. The structure-dependent drag coefficients calculated from the approach of the minimization of energy dissipation by drag force are then incorporated into the two-fluid model to simulate the behavior of gas–solid flow in a riser. The distributions of concentration and velocity of particles are predicted. Simulated results are in agreement with experimental data published in the literature. The effect of the wall friction on flow behavior of particles is analyzed. Friction between co-current downflow gas–solid flow and column wall was investigated by measuring apparent and actual solids concentrations in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) downer. A new model to predict pressure drops due to friction between the gas–solid suspension in the fully developed zone and the downer wall was developed. The results show that the friction between the gas–solid suspension and the downer wall causes a significant deviation of the apparent solids concentrations from the actual ones, especially for those operating conditions with higher superficial gas velocities and solids circulation rates. When the superficial gas velocity is greater than 8 m/s, the actual solids concentrations in the fully developed region of the downer can be up to two to three times of the apparent values. Particle diameters have different influences on the frictional pressure drops under different superficial gas velocity. After the frictional pressure drop is considered, the predicted actual solids concentrations by the proposed model agree well with the experimental values.},

	abstract     = {In literature little attempt has been made to verify experimentally Eulerian-Eulerian gas-solid model simulations of bubbling fluidised beds with existing correlations for bubble size or bubble velocity. In the present study, a CFD model for a free bubbling fluidised bed was implemented in the commercial code CFX of AEA Technology. This CFD model is based on a two fluid model including the kinetic theory of granular flow. Simulations of the bubble behaviour in Ruidised beds at different superficial gas velocities and at different column diameters are compared to the Darton et al. ( 1977) equation for the bubble diameter versus the height in the column and to the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation, corrected for the two dimensional geometry using the bubble rise velocity correlation of Pyle and Harrison ( 1967). It is shown that the predicted bubble sizes are in agreement with the Darton et al. (1977) bubble size equation. Comparison of the predicted bubble velocity with the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation shows a deviation for the velocity of smaller bubbles. To explain this, the predicted bubbles are divided into two bubble classes : bubbles that have either coalesced, broken-up or have touched the wall, and bubbles without these occurrences. The bubbles of this second class are in agreement with the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation. Fit parameters of Hilligardt and Werther (1986) are compared to the fit parameters obtained in this work. It is shown that coalescence, break-up, and direct wall interactions are very important effects, often dominating the dynamic bubble behaviour, but these effects are not accounted for by the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Experimental data on pressure, voidage, and bed height fluctuations, and the power spectral density are compared with three different implementations of the Lagrangian–Eulerian model. Though qualitative trends found in the experiment are correctly reproduced by the simulations, it is found that the simulations are particularly sensitive to porosity estimation procedures used in the three different simulation strategies employed. Furthermore, the phenomenon of particle clustering predicted by the model does not conform to experimental observations; this is because the physics of the break-up of clusters is not properly captured in the Lagrangian-Eulerian model. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract     = {Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) are versatile and efficient computational techniques to solve flow problems in complex geometric configurations that retain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. Although these methods became known in the 1970s and gained credibility only in the new millennium, they had already been conceived and implemented at the beginning of the 1960s, even if the early computers of those times did not allow researchers to exploit their potential. Nowadays IBMs are established numerical schemes employed for the solution of many complex problems in which fluid mechanics may account for only part of the multiphysics dynamics. Despite the indisputable advantages, these methods also have drawbacks, and each problem should be carefully analyzed before deciding which particular IBM implementation is most suitable and whether additional modeling is necessary. High–Reynolds number flows constitute one of the main limitations of IBMs owing to the resolution of thin wall shear layers, which cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries. To alleviate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies, although in these cases possible pitfalls must also be considered.},

The methodology proposed may also be useful for verifying 3D–3D dynamic scaling. According to the chaos scale-up methodology proposed by Van den Bleek and Schouten [1993. Chemical Engineering Science 48, 2367–2373], the information balance is taken into account. The complexity shown by these systems is measured as the Kolmogorov entropy. Fluidized beds of different geometry (2D, 3D) performing under the bubbling regime were operated at different bed height and bed aspect ratios by fluidizing several particle groups belonging to Geldart groups B and D. Finally, an empirical correlation is proposed to compare fluidized bed hydrodynamics. This correlation relates the global information flow of the system KG = KF rr to the relative Reynolds particle number.},

But operation at low fluidizing velocities, which is favorable to facilitate gas cleaning under the high pressure conditions, may lead to uneven distribution of the coating in the fluidized bed and to unstable operation due to agglomeration. Therefore a model has been developed which describes local fluid dynamics within the high pressure fluidized bed. Based on this model, the coating process is described and the distribution of the coating inside the fluidized bed is calculated. Furthermore a submodel for the calculation of local concentrations of liquid paraffin has been set up, which may be used as a basis for the prediction of agglomeration and thus stability of operation.},

	abstract     = {Turbulence characteristics of vertical air–solid pipe flow are investigated in this paper. Direct numerical simulations of the gas phase have been performed, while the solid particles have been simulated by a Lagrangian approach, including particle collisions. The modelling of wall roughness is shown to be important to obtain agreement with experimental data. Reynolds stresses and Reynolds stress budgets are given for both phases and for a wide range of solid–air mass load ratios (mass loads), varying from 0.11 to 30. Air turbulence intensities, Reynolds shear stress, and turbulence production reduce with increasing mass load. The mean air profile does not alter for low mass loads. In this regime, a simple theory predicts that the reduction of air turbulent production relative to unladen turbulent production is approximately equal to the mass load ratio. The insight that the solids Reynolds shear stress can be significant, even for low mass loads, is essential for this explanation. It is shown that at least two mechanisms cause the turbulence reduction. In addition to the classically recognized mechanism of dissipation of turbulent fluctuations by particles, there is another suppressing mechanism in inhomogeneous flows: the non-uniform relative velocity of the phases, created because particles slip at the wall, collide, and slowly react with the continuous phase. Investigation of the air turbulent kinetic energy equation demonstrates that the relative reduction of air pressure strain is larger than the reduction of turbulent production and dissipation, and pressure strain may therefore be a cause of the reduction of the other quantities. The fluctuational dissipation induced by the drag forces from particles is small compared to the other terms, but not negligible. For intermediate and high mass loads the air turbulence remains low. The relatively small turbulence intensities are not generated by the standard turbulent mechanisms any more, but directly caused by the particle motions. The particle–fluid interaction term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation is no longer dissipative, but productive instead. On increasing the mass load, the radial and azimuthal fluctuations of the particles grow. The corresponding reduction of solids anisotropy is an effect of the inter-particle collisions, which act as a solids pressure strain term. For intermediate and high mass loads, fluctuational drag force and particle collisions appear to be the relevant dissipation mechanisms in the solids fluctuational energy equation. In contrast to the air turbulent production, the solids ‘turbulent’ production term has the same level for low and high mass loads, while it attains a clear local minimum between. With increasing mass load, large-scale coherent turbulent fluid structures weaken, and eventually disappear. Simultaneously, the fluid fluctuations at relatively small length scales are enhanced by the motion of the particles. The highest particle concentration occurs near the wall for low mass loads, but on increasing the mass load, the concentration profile becomes uniform, while for the highest mass load particles accumulate in the centre of the pipe. Two-point correlation functions indicate that the addition of a small number of small solid particles to a clean pipe flow increases the streamwise length scale of the turbulence.},

Our method is built on the framework established by Glowinski and his co-workers [Glowinski R, Pan TW, Hesla TI, Joseph DD. A distributed lagrange multiplier/fictitious domain method for particulate flow. Int J Multiphase Flow 1999;25:755–94] in the sense that we use their Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) formulation and their operator-splitting idea but differs in the treatment of particle collisions. Compared to our previous works [Yu Z, Wachs A, Peysson Y. Numerical simulation of particle sedimentation in shear-thinning fluids with a fictitious domain method. J Non Newtonian Fluid Mech 2006;136:126–139; Yu Z, Shao X, Wachs A. A fictitious domain method for particulate flow with heat transfer. J Comput Phys 2006;217:424–52; Yu Z, Wachs A. A fictitious domain method for dynamic simulation of particle sedimentation in Bingham fluids. J Non Newtonian Fluid Mech 2007;145:78–91], the novelty of our present contribution relies on replacing the simple artificial repulsive force based collision model usually employed in the literature by an efficient Discrete Element Method (DEM) granular solver. The use of our DEM solver enables us to consider particles of arbitrary shape (at least convex) and to account for actual contacts, in the sense that particles actually touch each other, in contrast with the repulsive force based collision model. We validate GRIFF,1 our numerical code, against benchmark problems and compare our predictions with those available in the literature. Results, which, to the best of our knowledge, have never been reported elsewhere, on the 2D sedimentation of isometric polygonal particles with collisions are presented.},

Following material on basic thermodynamics and nonidealities in terms of fugacities and activities, individual chapters are devoted to equilibria primarily between pairs of phases. A few topics that do not fit into these categories and for which the state of the art is not yet developed quantitatively have been relegated to a separate chapter. The chapter on chemical equilibria is pertinent since many processes involve simultaneous chemical and phase equilibria. Also included are chapters on the evaluation of enthalpy and entropy changes of nonideal substances and mixtures, and on experimental methods. This book is intended as a reference and self-study as well as a textbook either for full courses in phase equilibria or as a supplement to related courses in the chemical engineering curriculum. Practicing engineers concerned with separation technology and process design also may find the book useful.},

In coupled DEM and multibody system simulation, the predictor model can be trained to output the interfacial reaction forces as well. An adaptive model order reduction technique is investigated, decomposing the media in domains of solid, liquid, and gaseous state. The model reduction is applied to solid and liquid domains where the particle motion is strongly correlated with the mean flow, while resolved DEM is used for gaseous domains. Using a ridge regression predictor, the performance is tested on simulations of a pile discharge and bulldozing.

	abstract     = {Hydrodynamic mixing of evaporating spray jets in dilute gas – solids pipe flows was investigated both experimentally and analytically. An analytical model was developed for the field description of each phase while an experimental system with a thermocouple matrix was set up to assist the modeling development and validation. A mechanistic model of thermocouple measurements in a general gas – solid – droplet three-phase flow was further established for building up the linkage between the averaged mixture temperature and the temperature of each phase as well as for the measurement interpretation. Phase transfer and interactions between the spray and the ambient flow such as entrainment and turbulent transfer across the jet boundary were delineated in the analytical model. The histogram of spray droplet evaporation, the jet boundary expansion, and the phase distributions of velocity, temperature and concentration were predicted. Effects of the ambient flow velocity, solids loading and spray jet mass flow rate on both the jet structure and temperature profiles were illustrated. Unique phenomena such as the shortening of the spray penetration, the ambient temperature reduction, and the ambient gas acceleration were explored and interpreted. The comparison between the modeling predictions and measurements on the mixture temperature profiles suggests that the proposed analytical approach is reasonably correct.},

In this paper, a parallel algorithm for macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling based on spatial decomposition (SD) is presented. The parallel implementation utilizes MPI as the programming environment. Due to movement of particles during simulation, the parallelization of MaPPM may suffer from load imbalance and attendant performance degradation. Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB) is adopted to partition the whole computational domain in a dynamic fashion to balance the workload in processors. The Shift scheme is modified to meet the communication requirement in the dynamic partition. The parallel approach was applied to simulation of bubble behavior in gas–solid fluidized beds with different system sizes to test its performance. The computations were conducted on cluster of workstations (COW). Experimental results show that the algorithm has a good scalability. With dynamic load balancing (DLB), the parallel efficiency can be improved by up to 8\%. To sum up, it was a successful implementation for the parallelization of macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling.},

Direct numerical simulation is performed by a compressible code, named S3D. In this paper, the effects of evaporating and non-evaporating droplets on isotropic turbulent flows are investigated.

	abstract     = {Gas–solid two-phase flow features temporal-spatial multi-scale structures. Calculation of characteristic scales for an air/FCC (fluid-catalyticcracking particle) flow indicates that the lack of scale separation entails a structure-dependent modeling approach even on the sub-grid level. For solving this problem, the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is extended and coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) through calculation of a structure-dependent drag coefficient in each grid, for which the schemes EMMS/sub-grid and EMMS/matrix are presented. Numerical analysis of the extended EMMS model suggests that gas and particles tend to achieve a compromise of flow dominance by gas finding the way with less resistance and particles clustering. So the dilute-phase part of drag force can be neglected and the major flow resistance arises from inside the dense-phase aggregate and over the interface. The inertial difference between the dense phase and the interface results in breakup or formation of particle clusters. The integrated approach is further verified through numerical description of the choking point demarcating the flow regime transition between the dilute pneumatic transport and the all-dense flow. Simulation shows that usual practice with assignment of only gas velocity and solids flux is insufficient for determination of the dense bottom height in a riser, and this can be attributed to the absence of another independent variable, solids inventory or imposed pressure drop. This critical phenomenon has been identified by earlier experiments, but most simulation practitioners remain unaware of it. More verification of the model is performed through visualization of micro-scale dynamics, characterization of meso-scale clusters and quantification of macro-scale distribution of two-phase parameters. Good agreement with experimental evidence is quite encouraging even quantitatively.},

To solve this problem, a newly established multi-scale CFD (computational fluid dynamics) approach, which is based on drag correction from the EMMS (energy-minimization multi-scale) model, is used to simulate our experiments about choking and relevant flowregime transitions. The computed flow-regime diagram is described with the functional relation between the imposed pressure drop and the solids flux at given gas flow rates. A bell-shaped area with an abrupt plateau, within which the solids flux equals the saturation carrying capacity and the dense upflow coexists with the dilute pneumatic transport, marks the choking transition in this diagram. The non-choking transition, however, is characterized by a smooth shift from the dilute flow to the dense flow, without an area for coexistence of flow regimes. The critical point, the summit of the bell-shaped area, demarcates between the choking and the non-choking transitions, near which the fluctuation of solids volume fraction reaches a maximum. In general, this CFD simulation of flow regime transitions suggests a good perspective of the EMMS based multi-scale approach.},

Particles exchange between these two regions across their neighboring boundary. Gas interchange between the jet and the emulsion phase becomes obvious with the jet evolution.

However, owing to the cluster diameter correlation used, the present model is still limited to the simulation of Geldart A particles. In this study, a stochastic geometry approach named doubly stochastic Poisson processes is used to analyze the fluctuation characteristics of solid concentration in CFB risers, which provides a mean to define the solid concentration inside clusters. The predicted results are validated by experimental data available in literature, and a revised cluster diameter correlation is then proposed for EMMS model previously developed for cocurrent-up gas–solid flow. Following our previous studies, the EMMS model thus improved is incorporated into an Eulerian–Eulerian description of gas–solid flow as a sub-grid scale model for inter-phase drag force, with which the hydrodynamics of both Geldart A and Geldart B particles in CFB risers are simulated. It is shown that the experimentally found S-shaped axial voidage profiles and the choking phenomenon can be well predicted. The computed one-dimensional slip velocities decrease toward the top of the risers and increase with decreasing cross-sectional averaged voidages. The experimentally found dependence of the root mean square of the solid concentration on its mean value at a given position is also well predicted.},

Two kinds of glass ballotinis, belonging to Geldart type B classification, are selected as solid material. Experiments are conducted under different operating gas velocities, static bed heights, and particle diameters. The results indicate that the upflowing particle velocity is a strong function of operating gas velocity and particle diameter, while the downflowing particle velocity depends mainly on the operating gas velocity. When the ratio of the operating gas velocity to the minimum fluidization velocity of the particles keeps the same constant, the effect of the particle diameter on the upflowing and downflowing particle velocities can be ignored. Both direction and size of the solid particle velocity are related to the bubble behaviors in the fluidized bed, and the upflowing particle velocity is lower than the bubble rise velocity. Furthermore, the across-sectional, non-uniform flow structure in the bed increases slightly with increasing static bed height at the high operating gas velocity.},

Geldart group B particles with mean diameters of 140 µm and densities of 2700 kg/m3 were used as bed materials. Flow behaviors were investigated with the solid mass flux ranges from 108 to 395 kg/m2 and the superficial gas velocity ranges from 7.6 to 10.2 m/s. The pressure drop, apparent solids holdups, average slip velocity and solids-to-air mass flow ratio under different operating conditions were obtained. The results showed that the riser total pressure drop increased sharply with bed height in the low elevation but slowly in the high elevation, since the solids holdup was higher in the low region than that in the high region. The solids holdup increased with the increasing of solids mass flux while it decreased with increasing superficial gas velocity. A dense suspension upflow flow (DSU) structure was found only existing in the low elevation while the rest upper region was still in the dilute phase, and the length of DSU flow structure increased with solids mass flux. The average slip velocity was found to be the strong function of apparent solids holdup; increasing apparent solids holdup leads to the increase of slip velocity. The riser total pressure drop and apparent solids holdup increase with the solids-to-air mass flow ratio.},

Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), a cross-sectional imaging technique, has been used to measure the dilute flow in a large square CFB. A sensor has been specifically designed for the measurement and a new algorithm has been developed for image reconstruction. Flow conditioning parts (internals) are designed and placed inside the CFB, aiming to enhance the contact between gas and particles in the dilute gas–solids flow. The dynamic characteristics and detailed information were obtained on two sections in the bed at different height. The performance of the internals is related to their size, combination, height in the bed and the superficial gas velocity. It has been confirmed that a particular combination of internals can increase the solids concentration in the central area of a cross-section, and can improve the probability density distribution (PDD) with a moderate gas velocity. Using a combination of a large internal at an upper location and a small one at a lower location can optimise the flow in the CFB.},

The mass transfer coefficients of gas to cluster increase with the increase of porosity of the cluster and inlet air velocity, but decrease with the particle diameter.

	abstract     = {Meso-scale structure is of critical importance to circulating fluidized bed (CFB) applications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with consideration of meso-scale structures can help understand the structure-oriented coupling between flow, heat/mass transfer and reactions. This article is to review our recent progress on the so-called multiscale CFD (MSCFD), which characterizes the sub-grid meso-scale structure with stability criteria in addition to conservation equations. It is found that the mesh-independent solution of fine-grid two-fluid model (TFM) without sub-grid structures is inexact, in the sense that it overestimates the drag coefficient and fails to capture the characteristic S-shaped axial profile of voidage in a CFB riser. By comparison, MSCFD approach in terms of EMMS/matrix seems to reach a meshindependent solution of the sub-grid structure, and succeeds in predicting the axial profile and flow regime transitions. Further application of MSCFD finds that neglect of geometric factors is one of the major reasons that cause disputes in understanding the flow regime transitions in a CFB. The operating diagram should, accordingly, include geometric factors besides commonly believed operating parameters for the intrinsic flow regime diagram. Recent extension of MSCFD to mass transfer finds that Reynolds number is insufficient for correlating the overall Sherwood number in a CFB. This is believed the main reason why the conventional correlations of Sherwood number scatter by several orders of magnitude. Certain jump change of state of motion around Reynolds number of 50–100 can be expected to clarify the abrupt decay of Sherwood number in both classical- and circulating-fluidized beds. Finally, we expect that the real-size, 3-D, full-loop, time-dependent multiscale simulation of CFB is an emerging paradigm that will realize virtual experiment of CFBs.},

The photocatalytic efficiency for this transformation largely depends on CO2 adsorption and diffusion. However, the CO2 adsorption on the surface of photocatalysts is generally low due to their low specific surface area and the lack of matched pores. Here we report a well-defined porous hypercrosslinked polymer-TiO2-graphene composite structure with relatively high surface area i.e., 988\,m2\,g−1 and CO2 uptake capacity i.e., 12.87\,wt\%. This composite shows high photocatalytic performance especially for CH4 production, i.e., 27.62\,μmol\,g−1\,h−1, under mild reaction conditions without the use of sacrificial reagents or precious metal co-catalysts. The enhanced CO2 reactivity can be ascribed to their improved CO2 adsorption and diffusion, visible-light absorption, and photo-generated charge separation efficiency. This strategy provides new insights into the combination of microporous organic polymers with photocatalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion.},

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keyword frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.},

	abstract     = {- {$<$}p{$>$}Solidification structure is a key aspect for understanding the mechanical performance of metal alloys, wherein the composition and casting parameters significantly influence the solidification process and determine the unique microstructure of the alloys. Following the principle of free energy minimization, the phase-field method eliminates the need for tracking the solid/liquid phase interface, and has greatly accelerated the research and development efforts geared towards optimizing metal solidification microstructures. This review summarizes recent progress in applying phase-field simulation to investigate the effect of alloy composition and casting process parameters on the solidification structure of metals. The effects of several typical elements and process parameters, including carbon, boron, silicon, cooling rate, pulling speed, scanning speed, anisotropy, and gravity on the solidification structure are discussed. The present work also addressed the future perspectives in this area, and aims to facilitate the widespread applications of phase-field approaches in simulating the microstructure for the solidification process.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Because of the biodegradable and environment-friendly properties, cellulose paper as flexible substrates is an alternative pathway to effectively address the electronic pollution. Recently, paper-based piezoresistive pressure sensors with a simple structure and easy signal detection have been widely used in health monitoring, soft robots, and so forth. However, the low sensitivity and narrow working range of paper-based sensors limit their practical applications. Here, an all paper-based piezoresistive pressure sensor is successfully constructed by assembling a bottom electrode with a screen-printed interdigital Cu electrode on paper and a top sensing electrode. The top electrode is simply fabricated using a one-step impregnation method to coat a thin poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer on air-laid paper. The constructed all-paper sensor displays a maximum sensitivity of 768.07 kPa–1, a wide detection range (up to 250 kPa), and excellent cycle stability (5000 cycles). Furthermore, the sensor can clearly respond from low pressure (such as wrist pulse) to high pressure (finger tapping). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the surface and interface design of rough and fiber-structured paper and the high conductivity of copper and PEDOT:PSS. Finally, based on the printing technology, array sensors are fabricated to identify spatial pressure distributions, demonstrating the capability of low-cost and large-area fabrication for the practical production applications. This printable all-paper sensor with excellent sensing performance exhibits great potential for use in new-generation green and portable electronics.},

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), an emerging class of solvents, are promising for applications as inexpensive “designer” solvents. Due to the unique structure of DESs, the hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor can be varied to create a mixture with specific physical properties. In this work, we proposed random forest (RF) models to predict the densities and the surface tensions of DESs, which are essential for the separation process. In the proposed models, the structural information and the calculated critical properties were used as two different types of features, respectively. The results demonstrate that the RF models predict the densities and surface tensions of DESs with high accuracy, with absolute average relative deviation (AARD\%) less than 1\% in the prediction of density and 3\% in the prediction of surface tension.},

The coefficient of restitution is shown to be an approximate function of the ratio of the relative impact velocity to the system compressional wave speed, and the ratio of yield pressure to Young’s modulus. The system compressional wave speed is further a function of the relative radii of the impacting particles, and it is predicted that the coefficient of restitution for equally sized sphere–sphere impacts is about 19\% small than for sphere–plate impacts of otherwise identical particles. This result is confirmed experimentally. Theory is also developed to quantify an increase in restitution coefficient following identical impacts at the same point. Progressive plastic deformation about the impact point leads to a collision that is increasingly more elastic, and the restitution coefficient for typical particles approaches unity after about five to 10 impacts. This is also approximately confirmed experimentally.},

	abstract     = {In this study, an attempt has been made to compare an intrusive solids velocity measurement technique with the laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) which is a typical non-intrusive solids velocity measurement technique. Single-fibre reflection (SFR) probe and LDA measurements were directly compared under identical operating conditions in the upper dilute zone of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB). This experimental unit was a cold model CFB (inner diameter of the riser, 0.4 m; height, 15.6 m). The measurements were taken at a height of 6 m above the distributor. Quartz sand with a mean diameter of 166 µm was fluidized at a superficial gas velocity of 4 m s −1. The cross-sectional average solids volume concentration was 1.2 vol.\%. The highest instantaneous local solids concentration was 5 vol.\% close to the riser wall. LDA measurements were taken with a miniaturized measuring head (diameter, 14 mm) operating in the backscatter mode and inserted in a probe casing (diameter, 22 mm). The focal point of the laser beams was located at a distance of 19 mm from the probe casing window. This allows the LDA measuring head to be moved through the fluidized bed and valid LDA measurements to be acquired inside relatively dense suspensions. The fibre-optical probe measurements were taken with a two-channel SFR probe (fibre: diameter, 600 µm; probe: diameter, 8 mm; centre-to-centre distance between the two sensing surfaces, 2.3 mm). The measurements at a superficial gas velocity of 4 m s −1 showed mean solids velocities between 10 m s −1 upwards and 3ms−1 downwards. The LDA system faces problems in the regions of higher solids concentration located close to the riser wall where data acquisition rates decrease considerably. The good agreement between the local average solids velocities acquired with the two systems proves that intrusive probe measurements cause negligible distortion of the solids velocity Pattern in a CFB environment.},

In the present paper an overview is given on available measuring techniques. In the first section techniques for industrial routine measurements are discussed. These are mainly temperature and pressure drop measurements. Practical applications and also the limitations of these techniques are outlined. In the second section more sophisticated techniques for local measurements inside fluidized bed systems, which have already proven their suitability in large-scale industrial reactors, are dealt with. Examples include suction probes for measurements of local solids mass flows, heat transfer probes for the detection of defluidized zones and solids flows inside fluidized-bed reactors and capacitance probes for solids concentration and velocity measurements under high-temperature conditions. The third section finally presents advanced techniques which are either still under development or which are particularly intended for academic investigations of basic fluidization phenomena. Examples include sensor techniques, imaging and tomographic methods. q 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

An array of thermistor probes measures the spread of the tracer. A series of experiments has been done in the upper core region of a 7 m tall, 0.20 m diameter test circulating fluidized bed (CFB). The experiments involved one type of particle, having 180 /\textasciitilde m diameter and 2350 kg/m3 density. Models for the spread of tracer particles, transfer of heat from tracer particles to surrounding gas and particles, and for heat transfer to the thermistors were used to make estimates of the radial particle ditfusivity in the core region. The diffusivity was on the order of 10 crn2/s for the range of velocities and solid concentrations tested. A second set of preliminary solid mixing experiments has been done in the bottom of a 1.8 m tall, 0.16 m square CFB using 55 /xm FCC (fluid cracking catalyst) particles. The mixing in this region, although not representative of a strictly diffusional process, appears to be somewhat more vigorous than the core mixing in the upper region of the bed.},

	abstract     = {Amine-infused hydrogels provide a facile platform for developing solid sorbents with improved CO2 capture performance relative to that of their liquid counterparts. In this study, we develop hydrogel materials that can be easily manufactured at a large scale and have high flow gas permeability characteristics, fast uptake kinetics, and minimal performance degradation after recycling, properties which are particularly important for applications in direct air capture (DAC). To overcome water loss issues associated with hydrogel materials for DAC, we have introduced high-boiling-point/nonaqueous solvent systems, which significantly lowered the solvent loss, leading to dramatically improved recyclability. Among the materials developed, cross-linked poly(N-2-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (PHEAA) infused with diethanolamine (DEA) exhibited 7.82 and 2.90 wt \% CO2 uptake with pure CO2 and DAC, respectively. Interestingly, by changing the hydrogel platform between either a cross-linked superabsorbent [i.e., poly(acrylamide/sodium acrylate)], PHEAA, or poly(acrylamide) (PolyAA) and impregnating with different amines/solvents, the uptake kinetics could be controlled and significantly improved. In fact, the PolyAA system impregnated with DEA in ethylene glycol showed 90\% of the total capacity (6.37\%) in 350 s (vs 4300 s in the case of the PHEAA/DEA system) as well as an enhanced amine efficiency (0.76 vs 0.28 mol CO2 per amine). Thus, this study demonstrates the use of different nonaqueous solvents on readily synthesized hydrogel platforms to improve the DAC uptake efficiency and kinetics. The fast kinetics enable shorter adsorption/desorption cycles, which will be advantageous in improving the CO2 uptake selectivity and reducing the sorption of water in larger-scale implementations of this approach, in both urban and industrial applications.},

	abstract     = {Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) uses hydrogen as fuel to generate electricity and by-product water at relatively low operating temperatures, which is environmentally friendly. Since PEMFC performance characteristics are inherently nonlinear and related, predicting the best performance for the different operating conditions is essential to improve the system’s efficiency. Thus, modeling using artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict its performance can significantly improve the capabilities of handling multi-variable nonlinear performance of the PEMFC. This paper predicts the electrical performance of a PEMFC stack under various operating conditions. The four input terms for the 5~W PEMFC include anode and cathode pressures and flow rates. The model performances are based on ANN using two different learning algorithms to estimate the stack voltage and power. The models have shown consistently to be comparable to the experimental data. All models with at least five hidden neurons have coefficients of determination of 0.95 or higher. Meanwhile, the PEMFC voltage and power models have mean squared errors of less than 1~×~10−3 V and 1~×~10−3 W, respectively. Therefore, the model results demonstrate the potential use of ANN into the implementation of such models to predict the steady state behavior of the PEMFC system (not limited to polarization curves) for different operating conditions and help in the optimization process for achieving the best performance of the system.},

The focus of the paper is on continuum methods where it covers the three common approaches in the sharp interface limit, namely the volumeof-fluid method with interface reconstruction, the level set method and the front tracking method, as well as methods with finite interface thickness such as color-function based methods and the phase-field method. Variants of the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method for two-fluid flows are also discussed, as well as various hybrid approaches. The mathematical foundation of each method is given and its specific advantages and limitations are highlighted. For continuum methods, the coupling of the interface evolution equation with the single-field Navier–Stokes equations and related issues are discussed. Methods and models for surface tension forces, contact lines, heat and mass transfer and phase change are presented. In the second part of this article applications of the methods in microfluidics and micro process engineering are reviewed, including flow hydrodynamics (separated and segmented flow, bubble and drop formation, breakup and coalescence), heat and mass transfer (with and without chemical reactions), mixing and dispersion, Marangoni flows and surfactants, and boiling.},

Local solids concentration measurements and global differential pressure measurements in the fully developed region were used to estimate the correlation integral. Pressure fluctuations in the fully developed region of the downer showed bi-fractal behavior. Large-scale behavior corresponded to a low correlation dimension, and small-scale behavior corresponded to a high correlation dimension. FCC particles showed more significant bi-fractal behavior than glass beads. Local flow dynamics from solids concentration measurements were contributed by solids flow of many different scales, namely dispersed particles and clusters of different sizes, so that there was only one scaling region in the log–log plot of correlation integral versus distance.

Both statistical and chaos analysis were employed. Values for the Kolmogorov entropy (K), correlation dimension (D), and Hurst exponent (H) were estimated from time series of solids concentration measurements. Axial distributions of chaos parameters were more complex in the downer than those in the riser, especially in the entrance section. Flow in the downer was more uniform with a flatter core in all the radial profiles of chaos parameters. The radial profiles of K varied significantly with increasing axial levels due to different clustering behavior in the wall region of the downer. In both the riser and the downer, anti-persistent flow in the core region and persistent flow behavior near the wall were identified from the profiles of H. Different flow behavior in the region close to the wall in the downer and riser was characterized from the combination of the three chaos parameters.

	abstract     = {Particle rotation is a common phenomenon in gas--solid two-phase flows. The paper presents theoretical and experimental investigations on particle rotation speed in the gas--solid flow inside a cold CFB riser. The possible particle rotation speed, caused by non-homogeneous flow field and particle collision, and its variation with time were investigated. The average particle rotation speed was predicted with considerations of particle size, average particle collision velocity, particle collision rate and particle number density. It is found that particle collision is the most significant reason for particle rotation. The maximal and average rotation speed for particles with an average size of several hundred micrometers in the CFB riser under typical working condition may be several thousand revolutions per second and several hundred revolutions per second, respectively. The rotation speed of glass beads with an average size of 500 m in the upper dilute zone of a cold CFB riser was measured by using a high speed digital imaging system. The variation of particle rotation speed with time was observed, which is in accordance with the theoretical result. The average rotation speed for glass beads was statistically analyzed based on a large number of particle examples. With several factors taken into account, the experimental result is considered to agree with the theoretical one.},

	abstract     = {Interparticle collision plays an important role in the mechanics of gas–solid two-phase flows. The paper presents direct measurements of collision rate as well as collision properties of spherical glass beads with sizes of 500 ± 50 lm in the upper dilute zone of a cold pilot-scale CFB riser, by using a high-speed imaging system. The recording rate of the high-speed digital camera is as high as 5000 fps with a resolution of 640 Â 480. A large number of particle movement images at a height of 3.54 m above the distributor plates were taken. Manual inspection and automatic methods based on digital image processing algorithms were carried out to analyze particle image sequences. The experimental results show that the measured particle collision rate is proportional both to the particles’ average relative translational velocity and the square of the particle number density, which coincides with the collision theory derived according to the analogy of kinetic theory of gases. But the theoretical model is found to overestimate the real collision rates, and a coefficient a of 0.33 may be used to correct this discrepancy. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are also discussed. The measurement results of collision properties based on more than 50 particle collision events agrees well with Walton’s hard-sphere collision model. The three collision parameters, i.e., the average coefficient of friction l, the normal and tangential coefficients of restitution e and b0, for the glass beads used are measured to be 0.175 ± 0.005, 0.96 ± 0.02, and 0.43 ± 0.09, respectively.},

Hydrodynamics in such a reactor coupling system is studied using a compressive model that considers the pressure balances around all the sub-units in the prototype. The continuity closure condition is used to determine the material balance of the solid particles flowing in the circulating fluidized bed system. The model predictions have good agreement with the experimental data in rather wide operating conditions, e.g., when the solids circulation rate goes to more than 400 kg/m2 s. The effects of the solids inventory, the superficial gas velocity, the particle diameter and density, the inside diameter of risers, and the fractional opening of the control valve for the solids flow on the operation of the DtoR system, are investigated and discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that the model offers appropriate guidance for the design and the operation of the coupled circulating fluidized bed system.},

A coupled high-density downer-to-riser reactor was proposed to utilize the advantages of both downer and riser to improve the gasoline quality and to efficiently control the product distribution. The basic idea is to decompose the complex FCC reactions into two reaction zones with distinct operating conditions. The downer accommodates high-severity operation at the initial stage with the benefit of near plug-flow while the riser is operated at a lower temperature with longer contacting time to promote hydrogen shift reactions. A comprehensive 2D reactor model is presented to predict the reactor performances for different reactor designs.

The hydrogen absorption of N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) catalyzed by a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was extremely slow, while the process could be significantly enhanced by simply mixing yttrium trihydride (YH3). The hydrogen absorption performance was similar to that on the noble metal catalyst Ru/Al2O3. Using isotope labelling, we demonstrated that the enhanced hydrogen absorption originated from the reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption property of YH3: the atomic hydrogen in YH3 can be transferred to the activated NEC molecules on Ni/Al2O3; subsequently, the hydrogen vacancy left in YH3 is replenished by H2. Inspired by this mechanism, we observed more general MH-promoted hydrogen absorption of LOHCs on transition metal catalysts. The combination of solid MHs and LOHCs with highly complementary merits provides a new strategy to develop high-performance hydrogen storage materials.},

An improved capillary force model is developed to compute the capillary interactions for partially floating particles at a free surface. Two well-known benchmark cases, namely drag coefficient calculation and the single sphere settling, are conducted to validate the resolved CFD-DEM model. It turns out that the resolved CFD-DEM model developed in this paper can accurately calculate the fluid-solid interactions and predict the trajectory of solid particles interacting with the liquid phase. Numerical demonstrations, namely two particles moving along a free surface when the liquid phase evaporates, and particle transport and accumulations inside an evaporating sessile droplet show the performance of the resolved model.},

Three different fluidization regimes, bubbling, slugging and turbulent regimes, are investigated and the results of 2D and 3D simulations are presented for both cylindrical and rectangular domains. The results demonstrate that a 2D Cartesian system can be used to successfully simulate and predict a bubbling regime.

What's more, PVIm-6-SCD, revealed as one of the most efficient catalysts compared to those reported in the literature, can efficiently convert CO2 by cycloaddition with various epoxides into cyclic carbonates at atmospheric pressure, even under relatively low temperature, solvent-free, metal-free and additive-free conditions because of its abundant mesopores providing a large specific surface area and high ionic density providing rich exposed bromide anions as active sites, as well as high CO2 adsorption capacity. Moreover, it can be easily separated with good reusability.

	abstract     = {High-pressure homogenization (HPH) has the potential to improve the exaction yield of bioactive compound from food and food waste. This study investigated the use of HPH or microfluidization as an alternative assisted method for sulforaphane extraction from raw broccoli seeds. The mean particle size, morphological characteristics, and extraction yields of all samples processed at different HPH pressure levels (3000-23,000\,psi) and passes (1–5) were examined. After HPH, the particle size of broccoli seeds was reduced 2–10 times and the particle size distribution pattern also changed from bimodal to unimodal with increasing pressures and number of passes. The highest sulforaphane content obtained with HPH at 5000\,psi and 5 passes was 2199\,μg sulforaphane/g broccoli seeds, which is 3 times more than the control one. Particular interest was given to the relationship between sulforaphane yield and particle size. Generally, the extraction yield increased with decreasing particle size; however, excessive size reduction did not necessarily result in significant increase in sulforaphane content. In addition, the pressure is not the higher the better ({$<$}8000\,psi, 55\,MPa). Scanning electron morphology (SEM) also confirmed that cell rupture and cell walls breakage occurred during the HPH process.},

	abstract     = {This paper is devoted to establishing a simple correlation calculating the equivalent diameter of clusters in gas—solid flow. Three different kinds of cluster sizes were distinguished in accordance with the measuring techniques: (1) vertical length measured with optical fiber or capacitance probes; (2) cross-sectional size determined with image analysis of graphs taken by video camera or other suitable detection systems; and (3) hydrodynamic equivalent diameter of clusters derived from differential pressure drop (solid concentration) via appropriate fluid dynamic models. The hydrodynamic equivalent cluster diameter correlated in hydrodynamic modeling was generalized as the diameter of spheres (uniform in size) having the same total volume as actual clusters (not a single cluster), which is subject to hydrodynamic equations, such as force balance, for clusters. It was demonstrated that hydrodynamic equivalent cluster diameter is close to cross-sectional size, but much less than vertical length of clusters experimentally measured. The correlation reported in Xu and Li (1998) (Chem. Engng Sci., vol. 63, p. 1349) was found to be capable of predicting hydrodynamic equivalent cluster diameters of heterogeneous gas—solid systems for both Geldart A and Geldart B particles, which was then further simplified for facilitating its practical use. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract     = {The radial profiles of particle concentration in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers experience actually a sequential variation as `uniform (dense)–nonuniform–uniform (dilute),' in response to the flow evolution from minimum fluidization to pneumatic transport. Through measuring the lateral distributions of solid concentration in the range εmf∼1.0 of the cross-sectionally averaged voidage, it was found that the first variational stage, from dense uniform (minimum fluidization) to nonuniform, is completed via the rapid decrease of the particle concentration in the bed core, and the succeeding second stage, from nonuniform to dilute uniform (pneumatic transport), is implemented via the quick decrease of the particle concentration near the bed wall. Based on this observation, general correlations were proposed to predict the local voidages on the bed wall (specifically, at the point where the dimensionless radius is equal to 0.99) and at the bed center, which can be used for the entire spectrum of gas–solid fluidization regimes prevailing in CFB risers. Further analyses demonstrated that such two variational regions are related also to the regime transition and the lateral distribution features of the transient solid concentration fluctuations.},

The risers had the same bed height of 3.0 m but different inner diameters of 66, 97 and 150 mm, respectively. Particles of FCC and silica sand were used, which belong to types A and B of Geldart classification, respectively. It was found that riser diameter has opposite influences for Geldart A and B particles on the total pressure drop across the whole riser and the differential pressure gradient Žapparent solids concentration. at a specified bed elevation. With increasing riser diameter, these two pressure drops increase for group B but decrease for group A particles, consistent with several other literature measurements in pilot-scale risers. As a result of these different dependencies of bed density on riser diameter, the saturation-carrying capacity, i.e., the solids circulation rate at the dilute suspension collapse, was also found to vary differently with riser diameter for different particles. That is, the increase in riser diameter increases the saturation-carrying capacity for Geldart A but decreases it for Geldart B particles. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Through reviewing research literature about the influence of solids holding height in the downcomer, the downcomer bed height, and that of solids flow control valve, the present article confirms that different axial voidage profiles might prevail in a riser even under specified Ug and Gs. New experiments were conducted to further clarify when and why Ug and Gs alone are insufficient to define the gas – solid flows in such CFB risers. Three different flow patterns, i.e. dilute suspension, axially nonuniform flow and fully dense flow, and their respective parametric dependencies of hydrodynamics are clarified. As a consequence, the article reiterates that the downcomer bed height or solids inventory, and the operational status of the solids flow control valve, including its opening and aeration, have to be specified in addition to Ug and Gs when analyzing the gas – solid flows in CFB risers. This results in the general steps necessary to compute the axial voidage profiles of such risers.},

Present in the plant as its precursor, glucoraphanin, sulforaphane is formed through the actions of myrosinase, a β-thioglucosidase present in either the plant tissue or the mammalian microbiome. Since first isolated from broccoli and demonstrated to have cancer chemoprotective properties in rats in the early 1990s, over 3000 publications have described its efficacy in rodent disease models, underlying mechanisms of action or, to date, over 50 clinical trials examining pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease mitigation. This review evaluates the current state of knowledge regarding the relationships between formulation (e.g., plants, sprouts, beverages, supplements), bioavailability and efficacy, and the doses of glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane that have been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies. We pay special attention to the challenges for better integration of animal model and clinical studies, particularly with regard to selection of dose and route of administration. More effort is required to elucidate underlying mechanisms of action and to develop and validate biomarkers of pharmacodynamic action in humans. A sobering lesson is that changes in approach will be required to implement a public health paradigm for dispensing benefit across all spectrums of the global population.},

It is shown that random advection and stretching by turbulence leads to the formation of scalar-enriched sheets of strongly fluctuating thickness η                                c                              . The molecular-level mixing is achieved by diffusion across these sheets (interfaces) separating the reactigants.

In particular the effect of inter-particle collision on the two-phase flow field was  investigated. The gas flow field was obtained by large-eddy simulation (LES). Particles  were treated by a Lagrangian method, with inter-particle collisions calculated by a  deterministic method. The spatial resolution for LES of gas–solid two-phase turbulent  flow was examined and relations between grid resolution and Stokes number are  presented. Profiles of particle mean velocity, particle wall-normal fluctuation velocity  and number density are flattened as a result of inter-particle collisions and these  results are in good agreement with experimental measurements. Calculated turbulence  attenuation by particles agrees well with experimental measurements for small Stokes  numbers, but not for large Stokes number particle. The shape and scale of particle  concentrations calculated considering inter-particle collision are in good agreement  with experimental observations.},

Previous literature offers only a very limited knowledge of the detailed solids flow profiles immediately above the solids feeding level and below the exit at the riser top, all with low solids circulation rates of less than 200 kg/m2 s. The study of entrance and exit regions is very valuable for a better understanding of the solids distribution in the high-flux riser. Asymmetry of the radial profiles of solids concentration and particle velocity at both entrance and exit regions are observed under high-flux conditions. Such asymmetry is much stronger under high-flux conditions than under low-flux conditions.},

A suction probe was used for the direct measurement, while the calculated local solids flux data obtained from solids velocity and concentration measured by two separate fibre optic probes were used to compare. Two shapes were found for the radial profile of the solids flux, a parabolic shape and a flat core shape. The shapes obtained could be predicted, based on the operating conditions, using a new concept of the effective solids saturation carrying capacity. The radial profile of solids flux is less uniform in a larger riser than in a smaller riser. Flow development is slower with the increase of riser diameter. The operating conditions were found to affect the solids flux in each reactor in the same general fashion: increasing gas velocity decreased the amount of downflow solids in the risers; increases in the solids circulation rate caused more solids to flow downwards.},

Experiments were carried out in a 140 mm i.d. bed with FCC particles (d, = 54 pm, 6, = 1 54.5 kg m-“) at operating gas velocities ranging from 1.5 to 6.5 m s-l and mass ratio of solid/ gas up to 6. The local particle velocity in a dense riser (mass ratio of solid/gas up to 15) was also determined by a transit time fiber optic probe. The experimental results show that the radial profiles of local slip velocity, gas velocity and particle velocity are all uneven. The radial profiles of gas velocity in the dilute riser are in a form with a higher velocity in the bed center which is 1.5 to 2.0 times the superficial gas velocity and a lower velocity in the wall region which approaches zero. Owing to the uneven distribution and movement of particles and gas, as well as the particles aggregation, the radial profiles of local slip velocity are non-uniform, flat in the central region and steep in the region near the wall, and a higher velocity value appears in the wall region. Experimental results also indicate that the cross-sectional average slip velocity calculated from one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model is far greater than the experimental local slip velocity.},

However, its significant effects on interfacial drag coefficient are seldom taken into account in current computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations by using the two-fluid models. The energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) approach, in which the heterogeneous structure is described by the so-called multi-scale resolution and energy-minimization method, is adapted in this study for investigating the dependence of drag coefficient on structure parameters. The structure-dependent drag coefficients calculated from the EMMS approach are then incorporated into the two-fluid model to simulate the behavior of the concurrent-up gas–solid flow in a riser. Simulation results indicate that the simulated solid concentration with the Wen and Yu/Ergun drag correlations is rather dilute, leading to a more homogenous structure; while the dynamic formation and dissolution of clusters can be captured with the drag correlations derived from the EMMS approach, and the simulated outlet solid flux and voidage profile in both radial and axial directions are in reasonable agreement with experimental results, suggesting the feasibility for the EMMS approach to be used as a sub-grid closure law for drag coefficient.},

Geldart, Powder Technol. 7 (1973) 285.] employed fluidization data obtained only at ambient temperature and pressure and from beds fluidized only with air. Unfortunately, industrial applications of fluidized bed technology invariably are at elevated pressure and temperature and with fluidizing gas other than air. Geldart classification of powders does not apply at elevated pressure and temperature. There are ample evidences reported in the literature indicating that normally Geldart Group B powders at ambient conditions, such as polymer particles, can behave like a Group A powder under polymerization conditions at elevated pressure and moderate temperature with substantial emulsion-phase expansion, relatively small bubbles, smooth fluidization, and reduced gas bypassing [J.R.

Three-phase flow patterns are classified as the gas-liquid and liquid-liquid flow patterns. Pressure drop, void fraction, liquid holdup, and phase distribution are important characteristics of the three-phase flow. These characteristics are generally associated with the three-phase flow patterns. Hence, the knowledge about flow patterns can help to predict the overall behavior of the three-phase flow. Studies have been conducted to identify three-phase flow pattern and their characteristics at various superficial velocities of gas, oil, and water. The major purpose of the studies is to gather information about the three-phase co-current flow and use it for improvement of the efficiency of the flow systems. Therefore, the accuracy of the measurement technique is critical. Several types of flow pattern identification and measurement techniques have been developed to improve accuracy and provide high-quality results. In this article, classical and advanced techniques used for the three-phase flow identification and measurement have been reviewed. The survey will help the researchers working in the area of multiphase flow to choose the right technique based on the objectives of the studies.},

The theory takes into account two sources of turbulence in particle-laden flows: (i) the carrier fluid velocity gradients; and (ii) turbulent wakes behind the coarse particles. The theoretical description is based on the modified mixing-length theory and turbulent kinetic energy balance method. The solution ofthe problem for particle-laden flow does not require any additional quantitative empirical data; only the standard semi-empirical parameters for pure carrier fluid are used. The dimensional analysis of the system of equations is used to reduce to the minimum the number of nondimensional parameters in turbulent particle-laden flows. In the limits of fine and coarse particles the asymptotic expression for turbulence intensity is found. It is shown that in the former case the carrier fluid fluctuations intensity is found. It is shown that in the former case the carrier fluid fluctuations depend only on the value of the total mass content of the admixture; whereas in the latter one they are determined by the total mass content of the admixture, the density ratio of the phase and the aerodynamic properties of the particles. The proposed theory is applied to predict the fluctuations intensity in various types of turbulent particle-laden flows. The results of the calculations are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data.},

The power spectral distributions on the 00s oscillations in the fast fluidiied bed were found to be composed of three frequency regions, and their differences from those in the bubbling fluidized bed and in the transport were discussed. The fractal dimensions of the power spectra in the high frequency region were evaluated through the so-called llf-like distributions. The l\&like and l/B,,-like distributions obtained from the power spectral analyses were considered to be two important characteristics of the linkage between the 00s oscillations and variations of the local solids structure.},

In addition, the growingbody of data on gas-solid flows is analyzed in a self-consistent manner. Pita and Sundaresan [2] have recently shown that the model was able to reproduce one set of experimental data surprisingly well although the model neglects some important physics relevant to the problem; for example, only elastic particle--particle collisions were considered. In this study, attention is restricted to the same case, and it is found that, in general, the model predictions compare favorably with the experimental data. Predictions from a model which neglects particle-particle interactions are shown, as well as the effect of these interactions on the complex relationship between the operating variables.},

	abstract     = {We report on 3D computer simulations based on the soft-sphere discrete particle model (DPM) of Geldart A particles in a 3D gas-fluidized bed. The effects of particle and gas properties on the fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles are studied, with focus on the predictions of Umf and Umb, which are compared with the classical empirical correlations due to Abrahamsen and Geldart [1980. Powder Technology 26, 35–46]. It is found that the predicted minimum fluidization velocities are consistent with the correlation given by Abrahamsen and Geldart for all cases that we studied. The overshoot of the pressure drop near the minimum fluidization point is shown to be influenced by both particle–wall friction and the interparticle van der Waals forces. A qualitative agreement between the correlation and the simulation data for Umb has been found for different particle–wall friction coefficients, interparticle van der Waals forces, particle densities, particle sizes, and gas densities. For fine particles with a diameter dp {$<$} 40 m, a deviation has been found between the Umb from simulation and the correlation. This may be due to the fact that the interparticle van der Waals forces are not incorporated in the simulations, where it is expected that they play an important role in this size range. The simulation results obtained for different gas viscosities, however, display a different trend when compared with the correlation. We found that with an increasing gas shear viscosity the Umb experiences a minimum point near 2.0 × 10−5 Pa s, while in the correlation the minimum bubbling velocity decreases monotonously for increasing g. ᭧ 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract     = {This study employs the VOF method to conduct the direct numerical simulation of the collapse progress of the near-wall bubble cluster. Factors such as viscosity, compressibility, and surface tension are taken into account, with an emphasis on the flow field energy evolution. Firstly, the collapse of a cubic bubble cluster comprising 64 bubbles is simulated, validating previous research regarding the morphological evolution and energy release mechanisms during cluster collapse. Overall, the cubic bubble cluster collapse exhibits a layer-by-layer phenomenon, where the outer layer bubbles collapse first, converting a portion of bubble potential energy into fluid kinetic energy, which then contributes to the inner layer bubble collapse. The pressure wave energy is primarily released when the whole bubble cluster completely collapses. Secondly, we investigate the collapse process of columnar bubble clusters, which closely resemble realistic cloud cavitation. By comparing the collapse behavior of bubble clusters with different heights, we reveal the non-linear delay effect of the cluster height on the collapse time. Additionally, we consolidate our long-term research on the bubble cluster and conclude that both the scale and shape of the bubble clusters have a limited impact on the conversion rate η of bubble potential energy to pressure wave energy η. For instance, when the stand-off distance η=1.5 and the inter-bubble distance D=2.5, the conversion rate η remains consistently 9–15\% for various bubble clusters of different scales and shapes.},

This paper reviews some recent studies of emulsions in turbulent Taylor–Couette flow, mainly focusing on the statistics of the dispersed phase and the global momentum transport of the system. We first study the size distribution and the breakup mechanism of the dispersed droplets for turbulent emulsions with a low volume-fraction (dilute) of the dispersed phase. For systems with a high volume-fraction (dense) of the dispersed phase, we address the detailed response of the global transport (effective viscosity) of the turbulent emulsion and its connection to the droplet statistics. Finally, we will discuss catastrophic phase inversions, which can happen when the volume-fraction of the dispersed phase exceeds a critical value during dynamic emulsification. We end the manuscript with a summary and an outlook including some open questions for future research.

Flow behavior and chemical reactions through a quiescent catalyst cluster were predicted. The distributions of gas temperature and concentrations of gas species were obtained using a simple two-dimensional model with Rh/Al2O3 catalyst particles. Numerical results show that the reforming reaction rate on catalyst particles in the cluster is much smaller than the rate on isolated catalyst particle in the stream. The molar ratio of H2/CO is increased due to catalyst particle clustering. The effects of gas temperature, inlet gas velocity and reactor pressure on reforming reactions are also investigated.},

To reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the cavitation bubble near a rigid boundary with a gas-entrapping hole, a fully compressible three-phase model, accounting for the three-phase volume transport equation, was implemented in OpenFOAM. The predicted bubble shape was validated with the corresponding experimental photos, and good agreement was achieved. The bubble’s primary physical features (e.g., the expanding shock wave, upward and downward liquid jet, and high-pressure region) are well reproduced, which helps understand the underlying mechanisms. The numerical results show that the solid wall with a gas-entrapping hole could affect the morphology of both the bubble and liquid jet, as well as shortens the bubble's first oscillation period in comparison to an intact rigid wall. The relationship among the prolongation factor, the standoff distance, and the relative size ratio is analyzed. It is found the prolongation factor increases as the relative size ratio decrease. As the standoff distance decreases, the gas entrapping hole plays a significant role in the oscillation period of the bubble. The current model can be further extended to reveal the microscopic mechanism of aeration avoiding cavitation damage and investigate the interaction between air bubbles and cavitation bubbles, which is of great interest to practical applications.},

It is also foreseen to totally change human-centred traditional engineering design approaches. Although still in the early phases, AI-powered engineering applications enable them to work with ambiguous design parameters and solve complex engineering problems, not otherwise possible with traditional design methods. This work attempts to shine a light on current progress and future research trends in AI applications in design/engineering design concepts, covering the last 15 years which is the ramp-up period for AI. Methods such as machine learning, genetic algorithm, and fuzzy logic have been carefully examined from an engineering design perspective. AI-powered design studies have been categorized and critically reviewed for various design stages such as inspiration, idea and concept generation, evaluation, optimization, decision-making, and modelling. As an overview result of this review, we can confidently say that the interest in data-based design methods and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has increased in recent years. Furthermore, the use of AI methods in engineering design applications helps to obtain efficient, fast, accurate, and comprehensive results. Especially with deep learning methods and combinations, situations where human capacity is insufficient can be addressed efficiently. However, choosing the right AI method for a design problem under consideration is significantly important for such successful results. Hence, we have given an outline perspective on choosing the right AI method based on the literature outcomes for design problems.},

	abstract     = {A modeling study is presented involving calculations at continuum and atomistic (DFT, Density Functional Theory) levels so as to better understand mechanisms leading to silicon nanocrystals (NC) nucleation and growth on SiO2 silicon dioxide surface, by Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) from silane SiH4. Calculations at the industrial reactor scale show that a promising way to improve reproducibility and uniformity of NC deposition at short term could be to increase deposition time by highly diluting silane in a carrier gas. This dilution leads to a decrease of silane deposition rate and to a marked increase of the contribution to deposition of unsaturated species such as silylene SiH2. This result gives importance to our DFT calculations since they reveal that only silylene (and probably other unsaturated species) are involved in the very first steps of nucleation i.e. silicon chemisorption on silanol Si–OH or siloxane Si–O–Si bonds present on SiO2 substrates. Saturated molecules such as silane could only contribute to NC growth, i.e. chemisorption on already deposited silicon bonds, since their decomposition activation barriers on SiO2 surface are as high as 3 eV.},

In the present study, a CFD model in ANSYS FLUENT is developed for better understanding the transport phenomena, especially the phase change, in a quite complex plate-fin heat exchanger operated in a gas refining company. The flow channels, ducts and passes of the cold box, are considered in the computational geometry. The porous media technique is introduced in the computational domain due to the excessive increase in the number of computational grids when the fins accounted for in the numerical domain. The flash calculations (FC) technique is coupled with CFD in evaluation of chemical species in the cold box by a user defined function. This study examines the importance of local thermal equilibrium between the porous medium and fluid flow without mass transfer (LTE-non mass), local thermal equilibrium between the porous medium and fluid flow with mass transfer (LTE), and local thermal non equilibrium between the porous medium and fluid flow with mass transfer (LTNE) in simulation of an industrial cold box. Numerical results are compared with the corresponding operational data and the best agreement is obtained by the LTNE approach. The calculated mean relative errors of the LTNE approach for the outlet vapor fraction of streams A, hot stream, B and C, sided cold streams, are 0.15, 0.352, and 0.173\%, respectively.},

The mass transfer of the gaseous reactants to the char surface is determined, and how the conversion is influenced by the degree of mixing of the multiphase system by turbulent dispersion. Particle/turbulence interactions are taken into account by a (Lagrangian) frequency spectrum of velocity fluctuations, which determine the dispersion of the char particles described here with the Tchen–Hinze model. Chars from solid fuels characterised by fuel ratio (FR) ranging from 0.1 (wood) via 0.5 (peat) and 1 (coal A) to 2 (coal B) were considered. The effective rate of the NO/CO/char reaction is determined as a function of the size and type of the char particle, temperature, particle concentration, reactor dimensions and fluidisation velocity, at atmospheric pressure.},

This investigation provided a great deal of critical information for use in future process development. Before solvent extraction, the FCC slurry is extremely complex. Saturates content is relatively high, and there are a variety of aromatic ring substituents. In addition, molecular uniformity is poor and chemical steric hindrance is strong. On the contrary, the composition of a fraction enriched in aromatics is relatively simple with excellent uniformity and homogeneous molecular alkyl-substituents. The aromatic enriched fraction (FCCRF) from the FCC slurry has weak chemical steric hindrance and, consequently, is more reactive than the original FCC slurry.},

More particle collision and less slip velocity between particles of different size were observed at higher solids loadings and superficial gas velocities. At lower superficial gas velocities and lower solids loadings, instantaneous reversal flow of particles and lower particles fluctuating velocities and larger particles/aggiomerates were measured along the wall. The radial distribution of axial particles velocity profile was flatter than a parabolic shape with maximum velocity of particles of different size in most cases away from the center. The particles fluctuating velocities was about 20\%--30\% of the particle velocity. However, it decreased at the wall region due to less probability of collision with moving particles and significant collision with the wall. In contrast, the turbulence intensity increased at the wall region due to lower particles velocities in this zone.},

	abstract     = {Mesoscale structures (bubbles, clusters and streamers) in two-phase flows, especially in gas–solid fluidized beds significantly affect macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior. For industrial-scale fluidized beds, it is typically impractical to simulate these structures directly due to the excessive resolution required. To model effects of mesoscale structures, the ensemble phase averaging method is extended to derive macroscopic averaged equations and their closures. It is found that added-mass and drag reduction effects due to mesoscale structures play essential roles in the macroscopic equations of motion. Unlike the classical added-mass force, which is proportional to the continuous fluid density, the mesoscale added-mass force is proportional to the mixture density. Thus for gas–solid systems wherein the classical added-mass force is almost always negligible, the mesoscale added-mass force is, in contrast, found to be quite important. Mesoscale drag reduction results from the fact that, in a particle rich region, there is significantly less relative velocity between particle and fluid phases than indicated by the macroscopic relative velocity.},

The probability density distributions (PDD) of transient solid fraction and particle velocity show bimodal distributions in the riser, while in the downer, the PDD curves only exhibit single peak distribution. The results indicate that two-phase solid flow structure exists in the riser: i.e. a dense cluster phase and a dispersed particle phase. Although there are solid aggregations in the downer, the solid concentration of which is much lower than that in the riser, and they could not form a dense cluster phase with solid fraction 1 À emf as those in the riser. From the analysis and comparison of transient solid fraction signal and the PDD of solid fraction and particle velocity in the riser and downer, it is clear that significant difference exist in the solid flow structure and the particle cluster mechanism between the gravity-assisted gas – solid flow in the downer and the against-gravity flow in the riser.},

The stability criterion, Nst =min, proposed in the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is demonstrated numerically, which reflects the spatial and temporal compromise of the movement tendencies of the fluid and solid phases, and leads to the formation of heterogeneous structures. Further work shows that when the total mass specific energy consumption for the solids (NT ) is variable, Nst /NT = min should be used as a more general expression of the original stability criterion.

These models treat the solid phase as continuum or discrete particles, which leads to Eulerian-Eulerian or Eulerian-Lagrangian formulations, respectively. Different governing equations and closure relations essentially result from an insufficient understanding of the complex gas-particle and particle-particle interactions for gas-solid flows. The current status of these models is discussed briefly in this paper. All the approaches in the literature modify only the solid phase momentum balance equcation introducing various forms of the solid phase stress tensor and the solid phase pressure drop in the Eulerian-Eulerian models. Taking them into consideration, a new model for predicting the fluid behavior of dense gas-solid flows in fluidized beds has been developed, which contains new terms in both the particle and gas phase momentum balance equations and requires only the use of an experimental drag force correlation. Several results are shown to verify the model's reliability, which include the homogeneous fluidization of Geldart type A particles, the bubbling and jetting fluidization of Geldart type B particles in rectangular beds, and fluid dynamics in a complicated geometry for a bubbling-bed of a fast internally circulating fluidized-bed biomass gasifier.},

So, to explore this less-known heat transfer process a series of experiments were conducted at four different superficial gas velocities and three external solids circulation rates in a CFB pilot plant with a riser having a height of 5 m and a cross section of 1.0 m×0.5 m. The experimental results suggest that both solids circulation rates and superficial gas velocities had a significant influence on the local heat transfer to the ceiling close to the riser exit to the gas solids separator. However, on the ceiling, opposite of the exit, solids circulation rates and superficial gas velocities had only a minor influence on the local heat transfer coefficients.},

Experiments are carried out in a segmented fluidized bed equipped with multiple pressure transducers. Three initial packing conditions and two experiment procedures are used. The fluidization velocity varies to cover a wide range. Results show that in the local fluidization region, the mixing and segregation patterns are sensitive to the initial packing condition. In the case of a fully segregated state with biomass at the bottom, the bed inversion can be significantly observed due to the great segregation tendency of biomass. Further analyses indicate that the mixing ratio exerts a subtle influence on the competition between mixing and segregation by disturbing the coalescence and break-up of the bubble. In addition, the pressure fluctuation signal proves to be helpful in understanding the dynamic features of the phenomenology.},

It is shown that the existence of particle clusters, unique to the solid flow behavior in such a reactor, can be predicted from this first principle approach. The results demonstrate that there are two types of clusters in a riser and downer: one is in the near wall region where the velocities of particles are low; the other is in the center region where the velocities of particles are high. While the extent of particle aggregation appears to be similar, the duration time for the first type in a downer is shorter than in a riser. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the formation of clusters is affected by a range of variables related to operational conditions, particle properties, and bed properties and geometry. The increase of solid volume fraction, sliding and rolling friction between particles or between particles and wall, or damping coefficient can enhance the formation of clusters. The use of multi-sized particles can also promote the formation of clusters. But the increase of gas velocity or use of a wider bed can suppress the formation of clusters. The van der Waals force may enhance the formation of clusters when solid concentration is high but suppress the formation of clusters near the wall region when solid concentration is low. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the effects of steam extraction on the hydrodynamic characteristics and desalination performance and then determine the ranges of rotational speed and extraction pressure suitable for the operation of RSCE, three-dimensional steady numerical simulations are conducted on the supercavitating flows in RSCE under different rotational speeds and extraction pressures. The results show that steam extraction has little influence on the morphological characteristics and resistance characteristics and is conducive to the generation of the steam in the supercavity. Besides, the steam extraction process enhances the re-entrant jets generated in the region with the radius less than 55 mm under all the rotational speeds other than 3250 r/min and under all the extraction pressures other than 3000 Pa. Despite little change of morphological characteristics, the intensified re-entrant jet increases the length and thickness of the developed supercavity, while decreases the size of the underdeveloped supercavity due to its interaction with the blade. RSCE has low energy consumption when operating under low extraction pressure and the rotational speed of 3750 r/min.},

The gas phase model is based on locally averaged two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations (N–S Eqs.) for twophase flow with fluid turbulence calculated by LES, in which the effect of particles on subgrid-scale (SGS) gas flow is taken into account. The particles’ motion is treated by a Lagrangian approach, in which the particles are assumed to interact through binary, instantaneous, and non-elastic collisions. The model predicts the heterogeneous particle flow structure and the gas and particle mean velocities and turbulent intensities. The gas turbulence induces particle lateral dispersion. The instantaneous gas turbulent intensity is attenuated by the formation of clusters, whereas the intensity is enhanced by the increase of gas–particle interactions. Globally, the presence of clusters enhances the gas turbulent intensity. Finally, the turbulent model is noticeably affected by an empirically assigned gas constant Ck and it consistently predicts values of the gas and particle turbulent intensities higher than those predicted by Smagorinsky’s method.},

The total collision time is divided into many small time steps. At each time step, the contact area is evaluated by the Hertz’s theory of elastic collision and based on this information, a grid system is generated for FEM computation to determine the temperature distribution in a particle and the heat exchange between particles. The total heat exchange is the sum of the heat exchange at all time steps. The FEM approach and computer code are verified by the good agreement between the numerical and analytical solutions for a well-established case. It is then used to simulate the transient heat transfer process during particle collision. It is shown that the heat exchange is affected by variables related to collision conditions and material properties. The results are qualitatively consistent with those obtained analytically based on the semi-infinite-media assumption. However, the analytical model overestimates the heat exchange, particularly when the Fourier number is high. A modified equation is proposed to overcome this problem based on the present FEM results. The equation is particularly suited for the newly developed particle scale modeling of the heat transfer of multiparticle systems.},

The present work adopts a high-efficiency vortex structure induced by a novel static mixer – hollow cross disk (HCD) to enhance the turbulent reactive mixing within the tubular turbulent flow. Specifically, the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMoM) coupled with the interaction-by-exchange-with-the-mean model (IEM) is utilized to simulate the consecutive competitive reactions system in this tubular turbulent flow. In order to quantitatively evaluate the enhanced mixing effect of the HCD, the turbulent reacting flows in the Kenics static mixer and coaxial jet mixer have also been studied. A combining analysis of turbulent flow field and the chemical species distribution indicates that the turbulent mixing enhancement mechanisms of these two static mixers. The simulation suggests that the sinusoidal wave structure in the HCD generate an important flow structure-counter vortex pairs (CVPs), which increases the momentum exchange between the near-wall region and the flow core. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the mixture fraction and reaction product concentration in these configurations agrees well with its turbulent flow field characteristics. The improved turbulent mixing initially is located at the jet periphery when at 0 {$<$} z/D {$<$} 2, which fits well with the HCD's longitudinal evolution of turbulent energy dissipation. Whereas at z/D {$>$} 2, CVPs of the HCD ameliorate the near-wall area's turbulent mixing and thus increase the reaction productivity and selectivity. Additionally, the effects of flow rate on segregation index are studied to suggest that the improvement of Xs for HCD is of about 35\% relative to the original tubular flow.},

The system is capable of measuring the force up to 50 g with an accuracy of 1 mg. The effects of the interparticle distance and Re on the drag forces of both the trailing and leading particles are examined. An empirical equation is obtained to describe the drag force variation of a single particle trailing in the wake of a leading particle. A mechanistic model is also developed to account for the motion of the trailing particle in the wake region of the leading particle as well as for their contact velocity. Moreover, a simultaneous flow-field visualization is conducted to characterize the wake flow phenomena. The results indicate that Re affects not only the magnitude of the drag force of an interacting particle but also its variation with the interparticle distance. At contact, the drag force of a trailing particle can be less than one-fifth of the drag force of a single particle without interparticle effects. Both tbe drag force measurements and the flow-field visualization reflect that the wake-influenced region of the leading particle can be longer at a lower Re. The mechanistic model suggests that both the drag force and the Basset force should be included in the description of the motion of the trailing particle in the wake region of the leading particle. The model predicting the contact velocity of the two particles is reasonably validated with the experimental data.},

In this study, the influence of ring-type internals on the reduction of nonuniformity in a riser of 7.6 cm in diameter and 3 m in height was investigated. Three ring internals with open areas of 70\%, 90\% and 95\% were installed in five axial positions in the riser. Measurement results for solids hold-up distribution of sand particles obtained using a fibre optic probe indicate that the internals can reduce radial nonuniformity, and evenly redistribute solids in the radial direction. Under high superficial gas velocities and low solids circulation rates, reversed radial solids distribution profiles with more dilute flow in the wall region than in the core region were also observed. A detailed study on the radial solids distributions around the ring internals shows the formation of a denser region above the 70\% opening ring as compared to above the 90\% and 95\% opening internals and a mom dilute region below all three rings. Results of the axial voidage distribution with the presence of internals show the formation of a zigzag type axial profile instead of the regular S-shape profile.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive model for the transient high-pressure vaporization process of droplets of complex liquid mixtures with large number of components in which the mixture composition, the mixture properties, and the vapor±liquid equilibrium (VLE) are described by using the theory of continuous thermodynamics. Transport equations, which are general for the moments and independent of the distribution functions, are derived for the semicontinuous systems of both gas and liquid phases. A general treatment of the VLE is conducted which can be applied with any cubic equation of state (EOS). Relations for the properties of the continuous species are formulated. The model was further applied to calculate the sub- and super-critical vaporization processes of droplets of a representative petroleum fuel mixture ± diesel fuel. The results show that the liquid mixture droplet exhibits an intrinsic transient vaporization behavior regardless of whether the pressure is sub- or super-critical. The regression rate of the liquid mixture droplet is reduced signi®cantly during the late vaporization period. The comparison with the results of a singlecomponent substitute fuel case emphasizes the importance of considering the multi-component nature of practical mixture fuel and the critical vaporization eects in practical applications. This paper provides a practical means for more realistically describing the high-pressure vaporization processes of practical fuels. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we present a mechanistic model in which the formation of the heterogeneous structure is due to the radial migration of solid flow from the wall toward center as well as due to the non-uniform acceleration of solids across the crosssection near the bottom of the riser. Firstly we present the general governing equations and discuss problem closure; then a simplified model with one-way flow coupling between the wall region and the core-annulus region is proposed to simulate the formation and development process of heterogeneous flow structures in the riser. Typical results of the three-zone flow structure along the riser are illustrated, which include the axial distributions of solids concentration and phase velocities in each zone, in addition to the pressure distributions. The model is also validated against the ECT measurements.},

	abstract     = {Particle science and technology is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area with its core being the understanding of the relationships between micro- and macroscopic properties of particulate/granular matter—a state of matter that is widely encountered but poorly understood. The macroscopic behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions between individual particles as well as interactions with surrounding fluids. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in terms of these interaction forces is therefore key to leading to truly interdisciplinary research into particulate matter and producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be effectively achieved via particle scale research based on detailed microdynamic information such as the forces acting on and trajectories of individual particles in a considered system. In recent years, such research has been rapidly developed worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology. This paper reviews the work in this area with special reference to the discrete element method and associated theoretical developments. It covers three important aspects: models for the calculation of the particle–particle and particle–fluid interaction forces, coupling of discrete element method with computational fluid dynamics to describe particle–fluid flow, and the theories for linking discrete to continuum modelling.

	abstract     = {A simple and reliable method to estimate the solid holdup distribution and solid residence time in a gas–solid riser flow is essential to the optimum design and efficient operations of riser reactors. The traditional approach of equating the local solid holdup to the pressure drop in a riser overlooks the effects of solid acceleration and energy dissipation in the acceleration and dense phase transport regions. The energy dissipation in these regions is mainly due to the interfacial friction between interstitial gas and suspended solids, inter-solid collisions, as well as solid–wall fraction. Most momentum-based models fail to account for the energy dissipation of inter-solid collisions, and the models using the simple granular kinetic theory fail to account for the energy dissipation in micro-sliding or rolling from off-center inter-solid collisions. This paper presents an energy-based mechanistic model to analyze the partitions of the axial gradient of pressure by solid acceleration, collision-induced energy dissipation and solid holdup in gas–solid riser flows. Based on this model, more reasonable estimation of axial distributions of solid holdup and resulted solid velocity can be obtained. Our analysis shows that the effect of solid acceleration on the pressure drop can be significant in a range of moderate solid holdup (typically from 3.5\% to 12\% by solid volume fraction) whereas the effect of energy dissipation becomes important in the dense phase transport region (typically when the solid volume fraction above 5\%). The exemplified results indicate that the traditional approach of equating the local solid holdup to the pressure drop overestimates the solid holdup by an error up to 50\% in the acceleration and dense phase transport regions in typical gas–solid riser flow applications.},

	abstract     = {Understanding and modelling the dynamic behaviour of particulate systems has been a major research focus worldwide for many years. Discrete particle simulation plays an important role in this area. This technique can provide dynamic information, such as the trajectories of and transient forces acting on individual particles, which is difficult to obtain by the conventional experimental techniques. Consequently, it has been increasingly used by various investigators for different particulate processes. In spite of the large bulk volume, little effort has been made to comprehensively review and summarize the progress made in the past. To overcome this gap, we have recently completed a review of the major work in this area in two separate parts. The first part has been published [Zhu, H.P., Zhou, Z.Y., Yang, R.Y., Yu, A.B., 2007. Discrete particle simulation of particulate systems: theoretical developments. Chemical Engineering Science 62, 3378–3392.], which reviews the major theoretical developments. This paper is the second one, aiming to provide a summary of the studies based on discrete particle simulation in the past two decades or so. The studies are categorized into three subject areas: particle packing, particle flow, and particle–fluid flow. The major findings are discussed, with emphasis on the microdynamics including packing/flow structure and particle–particle, particle–fluid and particle–wall interaction forces. It is concluded that discrete particle simulation is an effective method for particle scale research of particulate matter. The needs for future research are also discussed.},

The results reveal that with increasing Ug, local solids concentrations go through three evolution stages, reflecting a gradual regime transition process.

The upflowing particle velocity is strong function of both superficial gas velocity and spatial position. However, the descending particle velocity mainly depends on superficial gas velocity.

This study focused on the hydrodynamics and cohesive-like characteristics of solid particles in a pseudo-2D droplet gas-solid fluidized bed via two-way coupled CFD-DEM numerical simulations with the consideration of droplets coating process and liquid bridge force. Results revealed that the existence of droplets would lead to poor fluidization characteristics. It could be summarized that the increase of surface tension would lead to inadequate mixing. At the same time, larger value of liquid viscosity would cause a slower particle motion, while cases that exhibited vigorous fluidization corresponded to smaller values of viscosity. The influences cast by different contact angles were also studied and results showed that choosing an appropriate contact angle is of paramount importance to the optimization of the fluidization quality. It was also found that the more droplets injected, the worse the mixing behavior, while changing the number of droplets injected had no significant effect on the flow pattern and particle motion.},

Thus, a dynamic load balancing (DLB) algorithm is proposed for parallel CFD–DEM simulations in the CPU–GPU heterogeneous architecture. A type of computing load analyzing grid (AG) is developed which covers the entire simulation region. Then Kalman filtering and linear weighted method is used to solve the weight of fluid grids and particles. The domain decomposition scheme is updated according to the weights of AGs dynamically.

	abstract     = {Characterization by means of Kolmogorov entropy shows that the dynamics of the bottom bed in small size circulating fluidized bed risers are significantly different from the dynamics of the dense bottom bed in large size risers and, as a consequence, two types of circulating regimes are introduced: the exploding bubble bed for large risers and the circulating 'slugging' bed for small risers, the latter at high superficial gas velocities. In a pictorial fluidization diagram ten gas-solid fluidization regimes are given, seven of which are experimentally identified with the Kolmogorov entropy by varying the superficial gas velocity, riser solids holdup and diameter (or width) of the riser: bubbling bed, slugging bed, exploding bubble bed, intermediate turbulentbed, circulating 'slugging' bed, intermediate dilute flow, and dilute transport flow. No transition could be identified between the exploding bubble bed at captive conditions and the exploding bubble bed at circulatingconditions in the dense bottom bed of the two largest facilities in this study. This suggests that the dense boUom bed in large size risers can be considered as a bubblingbed. A turbulentbed was found in none of the facilities of this study with the Geldart B solids used. As well as by the Kolmogorov entropy (chaos analysis), the hydrodynamicshave been characterized by amplitude of pressure fluctuations, while a solids distributionanalysis has also been carried out. The study has been made in four (circulating) fluidized beds of different size and design, all operated with 0.30 mm silica sand. The dimensions of the fluidized bed risers are 1.47 X 1.42 x 13.5 m, 0.70 x 0.12 x 8.5 m, 0.12 m i.d. X 5.8 m, and 0.083 m i.d. x 4.0 m. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

At superficial velocities below 0.336Ut, the solid fraction and granular temperature are uniform throughout the bed. At higher superficial velocities, the solid fraction tends to decrease with height above the distributor, whilst the granular temperature first increases to a maximum before decaying towards the top of the bed. Correlation of the mean granular temperature with the mean solid fraction and the local granular temperature with the local solid fraction both suggest that the granular temperature in the liquid fluidized bed can be described solely in terms of the solid fraction. The granular temperature increases monotonically with solid fraction to a maximum at   ≈ 0.18 where it then decreases monotonically as   approaches the close-packed limit.},

A computer aided (CA) particle image processing system was used to analyze images which were obtained under different superficial gas velocities and solid circulating rates at different radial positions. Cluster size and its probability density distribution were investigated and a simple model was established. A roundness factor was put forward to describe the shape of the cluster. We also discovered that clusters assembled by particles show evident fractal character both in ‘shape’ and ‘fragmentation’. The fractal dimension of clusters at different flow patterns was found to be a function of position.},

This paper attempts to estimate wave breaking dissipation through a passive acoustic method. Initially, regular waves were forced to break in a flume. The breaking energy loss (severity) and the underwater acoustic noise were recorded. Two kinds of thresholds, in terms of sound wave amplitude and the ratio of sound wave height to period, respectively, were used together to identify the sound waves generated by newly formed bubbles. The frequencies of these sound waves are connected with the bubble sizes. Thus, a relationship between the mean bubble radius and the breaking severity was established and found to be linear. This laboratory relationship was then applied to Lake George data to study the breaking dissipation rate across the spectrum. An average acoustic spectral density threshold was proposed to identify breaking events from acoustic records in the field. The sound waves associated with bubble formation were selected by means of the same two kinds of threshold as used in the laboratory. Thus, the mean bubble radius of each breaking event was obtained and translated into the breaking severity. The values of experimental dissipation were compared with previous relevant results obtained through different methods as well as the wave breaking dissipation source terms ST6 (WAVEWATCH-III model) and are in good agreement with both of them.},

This paper presents a study on the liquid fuel vaporizing and mixing processes. An effective method for the calculation of turbulent two phase evaporating flow has been developed, based on a realistic droplet vaporization model and a comprehensive turbulence-particle interaction model. Using the method, the influences of inlet gas swirling and heating on water droplets evaporation and mixing processes are numerically studied and compared with our experimentally measured data which show a reasonable agreement. Then, fuel droplets evaporation and mixing processes in the pre-vaporized, premixed oil burner at different confinement conditions are simulated. According to our studies, a strong inlet air swirl can greatly enhance mixing between the droplets, the air, and the recirculated flue gas which enters the burner. It also sharply reduces the droplet velocity, and thus prolongs the droplet vaporizing and mixing time to maintain a stable premixed combustion, proper combustion chamber confinement should be designed to ensure that sufficient recirculated flue gas is supplied to fully vaporize the fuel droplets before exiting from the burner and the actual mass fraction of the gaseous fuel is higher than the flammability limit one.},
