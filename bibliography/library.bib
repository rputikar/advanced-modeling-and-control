Process Control: Modeling, Design, and Simulation teaches the field's most important techniques, behaviors, and control problems through practical examples, supplemented by extensive exercises--with detailed derivations, relevant software files, and additional techniques available on a companion Web site. Coverage includes:   Fundamentals of process control and instrumentation, including objectives, variables, and block diagrams Methodologies for developing dynamic models of chemical processes Dynamic behavior of linear systems: state space models, transfer function-based  models, and more Feedback control; proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controllers; and closed-loop stability analysis  Frequency response analysis techniques for evaluating the robustness of control systems Improving control loop performance: internal model control (IMC), automatic tuning, gain scheduling, and enhancements to improve disturbance rejection Split-range, selective, and override strategies for switching among inputs or outputs Control loop interactions and multivariable controllers An introduction to model predictive control (MPC)  Bequette walks step by step through the development of control instrumentation diagrams for an entire chemical process, reviewing common control strategies for individual unit operations, then discussing strategies for integrated systems. The book also includes 16 learning modules demonstrating how to use MATLAB and SIMULINK to solve several key control problems, ranging from robustness analyses to biochemical reactors, biomedical problems to multivariable control.},

Approaches are presented for measurement selection, process modifications, control structure design, and algorithm tuning to achieve good performance over a range of operating conditions. The sequence of topics - modeling, single-loop control and tuning, enhancements, multiloop control, and design - builds the student's ability to analyze increasingly complex systems, culminating in multiloop control design. The full complement of fundamental topics is reinforced by realistic process examples, including challenging end-of-chapter problems. Each technology is analyzed to provide guidelines for design and algorithm tuning; this approach demonstrates how fundamentals can lead to excellent practice and encourages the student to develop sound generalizations. The accompanying workbook and software, in the MATLAB environment, enable students to reproduce and extend the solved problems and design cases in the textbook. The simulations enable students to implement the digital implementations of most methods, for example, model identification, PID algorithm, windup protection, cascade, feedforward, and model predictive control.},

	abstract     = {Practical Process Control (loop tuning and troubleshooting). This book differs from others on the market in several respects. First, the presentation is totally in the time domain (the word "LaPlace" is nowhere to be found). The focus of the book is actually troubleshooting, not tuning. If a controller is "tunable", the tuning procedure will be straightforward and uneventful. But if a loop is "untunable", difficulties will be experienced, usually early in the tuning effort. The nature of any difficulty provides valuable clues to what is rendering the loop "untunable". For example, if reducing the controller gain leads to increased oscillations, one should look for possible interaction with one or more other loops. Tuning difficulties are always symptoms of other problems; effective troubleshooting involves recognizing the clues, identifying the root cause of the problem, and making corrections.  Furthermore, most loops are rendered "untunable" due to some aspect of the steady-state behavior of the process. Consequently, the book focuses more on the relationship of process control to steady-state process characteristics than to dynamic process characteristics. One prerequisite to effective troubleshooting is to "demystify" some of the characteristics of the PID control equations. One unique aspect of this book is that it explains in the time domain all aspects of the PID control equation (including as the difference between the parallel and series forms of the PID, the reset feedback form of the PID equation, reset windup protection, etc.) The book stresses an appropriate P\&I (process and instrumentation) diagram as critical to successful tuning. If the P\&I is not right, tuning difficulties are inevitable. Developing and analyzing P\&I diagrams is a critical aspect of troubleshooting.},
