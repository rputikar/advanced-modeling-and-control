  abstract      = {Phase-field modeling has increasingly been used to study microstructural evolution in fission gas bubbles in nuclear fuel to improve understanding of fission gas release. To improve computational efficiency, often only vacancies and gas atoms are included as defect species. In this case, the net effects of vacancy and interstitial production, recombination, and biased sink absorption are included as a net vacancy source, or net vacancy source combined with an effective sink. However, there has been a lack of clarity on what parameter values should be used for these approaches to best match the more complete physical picture that includes interstitials and vacancies. Here, we compare a phase-field model of void growth to analytical models for the source-only and source plus sink approach to gain insight into how the phase-field models can be parameterized effectively. The source-only approach provides greater flexibility to match growth rates determined from the full vacancy-interstitial picture. A strategy was developed for determining the value of the net vacancy source term by comparing to an analytical model that includes vacancy and interstitial production, recombination, and biased sink absorption. This strategy can be used to parameterize phase-field models of fission gas bubble growth.},

  abstract      = {As a result of human activity, approximately 7 Gt of carbon are emitted to the earth's atmosphere each year. A large portion of this carbon is in the form of gaseous CO2, and approximately 30\% of this CO2 comes from fossil fuel power plants. In addition to rising levels of atmospheric CO2, the earth's temperature is increasing. Since CO2 can act as a trap for heat (similar to the glass in a greenhouse), reduction of CO2 emissions is an important area of research. Separation and sequestration of CO2 are near-term goals for emissions reduction. Better fuel efficiency (in power production, transportation, and other areas) can be considered a mid-term goal. An acceptable long-term goal for reducing emissions is using alternate power sources such as nuclear, solar, and wind power. Because separation and sequestration are short-term goals, they are critical and challenging steps for researchers. Methods that are reviewed in this paper include absorption using solvents or solid sorbents, pressure- and temperature-swing adsorption using various solid sorbents, cryogenic distillation, membranes, and several novel and emerging technologies. Upon completion of this review, it was concluded that the most promising current method for CO2 separation is liquid absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA). While this method is currently most promising, the development of ceramic and metallic membranes for membrane diffusion should produce membranes significantly more efficient at separation than liquid absorption. The other methods investigated in this report are either too new for comparison or appear unlikely to experience significant changes to make them desirable for implementation.},

  abstract      = {We have studied plane shear flow of nearly homogeneous assemblies of uniformly sized, spherical particles in periodic domains. Our focus has been on the effect of interparticle attractive forces on the flow behavior manifested by dense assemblies. As a model problem, the cohesion resulting from van der Waals force acting between particles is considered. Simulations were performed for different strengths of cohesion, shear rates, particle stiffnesses, particle volume fractions and coefficients of friction. From each simulation, the average normal and shear stresses and the average coordination number have been extracted. Not surprisingly, the regimes of flow reported by Campbell [C.S. Campbell, Granular Shear Flows at the Elastic Limit, J. Fluid Mech. 465 (2002) 261-291] for the case of cohesionless particles – namely, inertial, elastic–inertial and elastic–quasistatic regimes – persist when cohesion is included. The elastic–quasistatic regime was found to correspond with the coordination number decreasing with increasing shear rate, while in the inertial regime the coordination number increased with shear rate. A striking result observed in the simulations is that the influence of cohesion on stress becomes more pronounced with decreasing particle volume fraction. Furthermore, the window in the shear rate–particle volume fraction space over which the elastic–quasistatic regime is obtained was found to expand as the strength of cohesion was increased. When the particle volume fraction is so high that even a cohesionless system would be in the elastic–quasistatic regime, the addition of cohesion had minimal effect on the stresses. At lower particle volume fractions where a cohesionless assembly would have been in the inertial regime, we present a new scaling which permits collapse of all the data at various strengths of cohesion and shear rates into a single master curve for each particle volume fraction and coefficient of friction. The regimes of flow in this master curve are discussed and the scaling for the normal stress in elastic–quasistatic flow is identified.},

  abstract      = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a two-step combustion process that produces a pure CO2 stream, ready for compression and sequestration. A CLC system is composed by two reactors, an air and a fuel reactor, and an oxygen carrier (OC) circulating between the reactors, which transfers the oxygen necessary for the fuel combustion from the air to the fuel. This system can be designed similar to a circulating fluidised bed, but with the addition of a bubbling fluidised bed on the return side. A mapping of the range of operational conditions, design values, and OC characteristics is presented for the most usual metal oxides (CuO, Fe2O3, and NiO) and different fuel gases (CH4, H2, and CO). The pressure operation of a CLC system is also considered. Moreover, a comparison of the possible use of three high reactive OCs (Cu10Al-I, Fe45Al-FG, Ni40Al-FG) previously characterised is carried out. It was found that the circulation rates and the solids inventories are linked, and the possible operating conditions are closely dependent on the reactivity of the OCs. The operational limits of the solids circulation rates, given by the mass and heat balances in the system, were defined for the different type of OCs. Moreover, a plot to calculate the solids inventories in a CLC system, valid for any type of OC and fuel gas, is proposed. The minimum solids inventories depended on the fuel gas used, and followed the order CH4 {$>$} CO {\$>\$} H2. Values of minimum solids inventories in a range from 40 to 133 kg/MWf were found for the OCs used in this work, excepting for the reaction of Fe45Al-FG with CH4, which needs a higher amount of solids because of its low reactivity. From the economic analysis carried out it was found the cost of the OC particles does not represent any limitation to the development of the CLC technology.},

  abstract      = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a method for the combustion of fuel gas with inherent separation of carbon dioxide. This technique involves the use of two interconnected reactors, an air reactor and a fuel reactor. The oxygen demanded in the fuel combustion is supplied by a solid oxygen carrier, which circulates between both reactors. Fuel gas and air are never mixed and pure CO2 can be obtained from the flue gas exit. This paper presents the results from the use of an iron-based oxygen-carrier in a continuously operating laboratory CLC unit, consisting of two interconnected fluidized beds. Natural gas or syngas was used as fuel, and the thermal power was between 100 and 300 W. Tests were performed at four temperatures: 1073, 1123, 1173 and 1223 K. The prototype was successfully operated for all tests and stable conditions were maintained during the combustion. The same particles were used during 60 h of hot fluidization conditions, whereof 40 h with combustion. The combustion efficiency of syngas was high, about 99\% for all experimental conditions. However, in the combustion tests with natural gas, there was unconverted methane in the exit flue gases. Higher temperature and lower fuel flows increase the combustion efficiency, which ranged between 70\% and 94\% at 1123 K. No signs of agglomeration or mass loss were detected, and the crushing strength of the oxygen carrier particles did not change significantly. Complementary experiments in a batch fluidized bed were made to compare the reactivity of the oxygen carrier particles before and after the 40 h of operation, but the reactivity of the particles was not affected significantly.},

The fluid is described using an extension of the Navier-Stokes equations endowed with distributed capillary stresses in the context of a diffuse interface approach. The collapse of the bubble is triggered by overpressure in the liquid and leads to an intense jet that pierces the bubble, changing the bubble topology from spheroidal to toroidal, and impinges the solid wall inducing an intense and strongly localized load. Moreover, at bubble collapse, a compression wave is launched into the liquid surrounding the bubble. By propagating along the solid surface, the compression wave combined with the liquid jet excites the dynamics of the elastic solid, producing a complex system of waves, including, longitudinal, transversal, and Rayleigh waves, propagating in the solid. It is conjectured that the intense deformation of the solid induced by the strongly localized liquid jet may lead to the plastic deformation of the solid producing the surface pitting observed in many applications subject to cavitation-induced material damage.},

Micromixing quality plays crucial role in ultrafast co-precipitation reactions, and depends both on the specific energy dissipation rate and on the geometry of the reactor as well as the solutions feeding manner. Solutions in MRISF-2 could be supplied by different ways: through the upper and/or lower tangential inlet pipes and through the central (axial) inlet pipe. This paper is aimed to compare experimentally and numerically three ways of liquid solutions feeding in MRISF-2 with objective to find the conditions of the highest specific energy dissipation rate. The best method of solutions supplying was found experimentally and confirmed numerically: one solution is supplied tangentially, the other through the central inlet pipe. The average specific energy dissipation rate for this method is 1.7 and 6.0 times higher compared to supply through two upper tangential inlet pipes and upper\,+\,lower tangential inlet pipes, respectively. This advantage was confirmed by measurements of segregation index Xs by use of iodide-iodate reaction technique. Good agreement between experimental and numerical simulation results for energy dissipation rate was found for all studied cases.},

  abstract      = {Fast-rising population and economic growth are inducing a rapid increase in the energy demand. To date, fossil fuels constitute the primary energy~source, but their combustion emits greenhouse gases responsible of global warming. Therefore, developing environment-friendly energy sources is critical. For instance, pyrolysis converts biomass into valuable compounds such as syngas, biochar, and bio-oil, yet produced bio-oil and biogas require further upgrading processes before their use. Current processes include gasification, purification, separation, and catalytic pyrolysis. For syngas synthesis, applying one or a couple of these processes leads to low product yields since they favor the production of bio-oil or biogas. Moreover, tar formation during biomass pyrolysis remains a major technological issue in reactor design. Catalytic reforming is an attractive and efficient method for tar removal via tar oxidation into valuable gases. More importantly, catalytic reforming of pyrolysis volatile products constitutes a promising approach for both tar removal and biogas conversion into syngas. Here, we review the two major catalytic approaches of biomass valorization: catalytic pyrolysis and pyrolysis-catalytic reforming. We demonstrate that the catalytic pyrolysis mainly upgrades bio-oil, while pyrolysis-catalytic efficiently converts biomass into syngas. We analyze the effects of temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio on the products derived from coupling the pyrolysis of agricultural biomass waste to catalytic reforming. Increasing the temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio enhances hydrogen yield. A complete conversion of pyrolysis volatile products into syngas was obtained at 600~\textdegree{}C with steam-to-carbon ratio of 4 for pinewood biomass and nickel catalyst. The use of nickel catalyst supported on lanthana–alumina Ni/La2O3-\ensuremath{\alpha}Al2O3 for the steam reforming of raw bio-oil produced from pine sawdust pyrolysis enhanced the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, reaching 95\% and 93\%, respectively, at 700~\textdegree{}C and steam-to-carbon of 15.},

The main aim of this study is to summarise the recent formulation trends with lupin as an ingredient of new food products based on consumer perception and acceptability. The present systematic literature review was conducted through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The eligibility criteria for the articles to be considered were: (a) the manufacturing of a food product with lupin as a formulation ingredient; (b) the food product developed was tested by a sensorial panel. A total of 33 studies filled the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the qualitative synthesis. The sensory analysis of each product was notoriously different based on the jury evaluators and measurement scales used but revealed high acceptability rates for possible future consumers. The high protein and fibre contents of lupin were the most cited reason associated with the importance of nutrient-rich food products for consumers. More research on foods with high nutrition profiles and well-established sustainability parameters is crucial to promote healthier food environments.},

  abstract      = {Extractive desulfurization of fuel oils using ionic liquids as extractive reagents.           ,              Hydrodesulfurization (HDS), a widely employed method in industries for the desulfurization of fuel oils, such as gasoline and diesel fuel is faced with the challenge of producing lower-sulfur or sulfur-free fuel oils, which are required by more and more countries. However, HDS is not very effective for the removal of thiophenic sulfur compounds due to sterically-hindered adsorption on the catalyst surface, unless operated under harsh conditions, such as high temperature, high pressure, and requirement of a noble catalyst and hydrogen. Extractive desulfurization (EDS) of fuel oils using ionic liquids (ILs) has been intensively studied in recent decades and has a good future as an alternative or complementary method to HDS. In this review, we reviewed the research results of EDS using ILs and provided comprehensive discussions on diverse factors, which influence desulfurization, such as the IL species, IL–oil mass ratio, initial sulfur content, temperature, time, mutual solubility, multiple extractions and regeneration. Potential problems or shortcomings were also stated. Some other desulfurization methods currently under study, such as extraction, oxidation, adsorption and biodesulfurization were also briefly outlined. It can be inferred that ILs remain a class of ideal solvents to realize clean fuel oil in the near future because of their desirable physiochemical properties, which are lacking in molecular organic solvents, while there are possible challenges, such as relatively high viscosity and low efficiency.},

HQP in science and engineering are faced with numerous opportunities for employment, but they are not well-trained to pursue these opportunities. The CREATE program aims to prepare HQP for a wider range of career options within the Canadian workforce by providing technical and professional training to enable HQP to develop the skills needed for the job market. This training is delivered in various formats such as workshops, courses, panel discussions, lab demonstrations, and innovation fairs which are suited to the needs of the HQP. The authors of this paper used a qualitative case study approach to explore the impact the CREATE program has on HQP's job readiness. Thirty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from the program HQP. Three themes emerged from the analyzed data. One of the study findings indicated that the technical and professional training provided by the CREATE program helped HQP develop the basic skills required to enter the job market. However, some participants felt that the program only facilitated their skill development, not their job readiness. The participants stated that universities should facilitate job fairs to provide opportunities for them to meet with professionals from the government, academia, and industry. Additional research is required to examine the impact of the CREATE program by using a larger sample and different program components.},

The method based on the measurement of the time required for all the solids to leave the bed without feeding in any fresh solid is specially interesting because of its rapidity and simplicity. The determined transport velocities were strongly dependent on the solid particle size and density.

  abstract      = {The recent explosion at a steam reforming facility producing hydrogen in California, U.S., suggests the need to revisit the design of the traditional steam methane reforming (SMR) process from a safety perspective to further enable the growth of the hydrogen economy. Specifically, it is important to analyze the interaction between process, economic and safety variables within the SMR process through an integrated model approach to maintain positive economics of hydrogen production while making the process safer. The integrated model described within this study consists of process synthesis, quantitative risk assessment and economic analysis sub-models facilitating a holistic design for the SMR process. The usefulness of the integrated model is demonstrated by evaluating alternatives based on the inherently safer design philosophy. For the considered base design, it was found that decreasing the pressure of purge gas exiting the purge gas compressor leads to a reduction in the jet-fire axial risk distance of purge gas with minor economic benefits. Also, increasing the temperature of syngas entering the condensation unit leads to a reduction in the jet-fire axial risk distance for both purge gas and syngas with slight decrease in process economics.},

These profiles are S-shaped or non-S-shaped depending on the operating conditions, and are similar to those reported in the literature with other types and sizes of solids. The Kunii and Levenspiel exponential-decay model for the axial voidage profiles has been modified to consider a freeboard height lower than the transport disengaging height (TDH), developing some equations to obtain the axial voidage profiles at heights lower than the TDH. Two equations have been proposed to calculate the K constant and the decay constant a as a function of the operating conditions.

The methods assume constant relative volatilities and constant molar flow rates within each distillation section. The design equations are based on the Underwood equations for the calculation of minimum reflux (reboil) ratio, the analytical formulations of the distillation line, the Eigenfunction and the number of theoretical stages for each mass transfer section of the column. Furthermore, the geometrical properties of a given separation are considered. Optimization algorithms based on the minimization of the total number of theoretical stages of the column with taking into account the mass balance at each feed section have been elaborated. In comparison to the boundary value method the new short-cut methods require a minimum number of specifications; they do not need any graphical support, and provide a lower total number of theoretical stages particularly for complex configurations. The new short-cut methods have been extended to the design of columns separating azeotropic mixtures by approximating the latter by appropriate pseudo-ideal mixtures. Several separation examples for azeotropic mixtures, including different types of splits as well as columns with simple and complex configurations were tested and show a very good agreement with the simulation results obtained with Radfrac (Aspenplus).},

To obtain and maintain mixing efficiency in this process, one of the essential parameters in consideration is the impeller design, which depends on several factors. High sugar titer through enzyme hydrolysis of high-solid biomass has been achieved in recent years. However, there are few literatures on the effect of impeller designs on mixing efficiency of the overall process of enzyme hydrolysis and fermentation, especially simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, and its modifications. This review has provided basic information on the various impeller designs of stirred tank bioreactors and the factors to consider when selecting a suitable impeller for the purpose of increasing ethanol titer from high-solids loading. This shows that an improvement to the impellers can enhance mixing by the modification of existing impellers of stirred tank bioreactors for ethanol production.},

The ANN models were further used to design the supervisory MPC for the residential HVAC system. The MPC generated the dynamic temperature set-point profiles of the zone air and buffer tank water which resulted in the operating cost reduction of the equipment without violating the thermal comfort constraints. When compared to the fixed set-point (FSP), MPC was able to save operating cost between 6\% and 73\% depending on the season.},

However, due to their substantial benefits with respect to significantly improved heat transfer and fouling reduction, successful applications also exist in areas such as petrochemical, minerals and food processing as well as in the paper and power industries. The excellent performance of fluidized bed heat exchangers is related to the interaction between particles and heat transfer surface and to mixing effects in the viscous sublayer. In this paper, the results of experimental investigations on heat transfer for a wide range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are presented. New design equations have been developed for the prediction of bed voidage and heat transfer coefficients.

Continuum  equations for gas–particle flows, coupled with constitutive equations for particle-phase  stress deduced from kinetic theory of granular materials, can capture the formation of  such meso-scale structures. These structures arise as a result of an inertial instability  associated with the relative motion between the gas and particle phases, and an  instability due to damping of the fluctuating motion of particles by the interstitial  fluid and inelastic collisions between particles. It is demonstrated that the meso-scale  structures are too small, and hence too expensive, to be resolved completely in  simulation of gas–particle flows in large process vessels. At the same time, failure  to resolve completely the meso-scale structures in a simulation leads to grossly  inaccurate estimates of inter-phase drag, production/dissipation of pseudo-thermal  energy associated with particle fluctuations, the effective particle-phase pressure and  the effective viscosities. It is established that coarse-grid simulation of gas–particle  flows must include sub-grid models, to account for the effects of the unresolved meso-scale  structures. An approach to developing a plausible sub-grid model is proposed.},

  abstract      = {Fluidized beds heated via fossil fuel combustion have been widely used in industry for various applications. Heating these fluidized beds with clean electricity is emerging as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve overall energy efficiency, and for some applications, improve product quality. This review covers the development status of electrically heated fluidized beds (EHFBs) with a variety of heating principles, including Joule heating, induction heating, electromagnetic irradiation, sonication, plasma heating and gas preheating. An analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of these heating principles is presented, along with their suitability for different applications. Current and potential industrial applications using EHFBs for highly diversified processes, from material processing and biomass gasification to space exploration, are highlighted. Each application presents its own unique opportunities and challenges. The selection of a method to deliver electrical heat depends on the specific purpose of each application, materials involved, and the required configuration of the EHFB. Hence, methods to assess key performance indicators are described. To date, only a few applications have been commercialized, mostly for drying and material processing. Recommendations for EHFB advancement are provided so that their full potential can be realized.},

  abstract      = {Abstract. Hydrodynamic cavitation has been employed in literature to distort the structure of crude oil as a way of its intensification prior to refining, with majority paying attention to adding additives in order to improve the yield. No attention has been paid to varying the storage time of the crude after cavitation. Hence, it was thought necessary to vary the storage time after cavitation in order to increase the yield of crude oil. 350 g of the feedstock was characterized and then continuously circulated through an orifice/cavitation device for 30s, then it was stored in an airtight plastic container. The storage time was varied from 2 hours to 240 hours for different runs. True boiling Point distillation for 295g of the cavitated crude was carried out after. The results showed that there was a strong correlation between the changes in the density of the stored cavitated crude and the yield of the crude. The yield of lighter distillate/fractions increases with reduction in density of stored cavitated crude and the yield of heavier distillate increases with increase in density of cavitated crude. The increase in the yield of light fractions was attributed to cold cracking of heavier molecules in the crude and the increase in yield of heavier fractions was attributed to the recombination reactions of the radical molecules in the crude. The increase in the overall yield when compared with untreated crude can be achieved by striking a balance between cold cracking and recombination reactions which occurred at 122 hours of storage after cavitation},

The dusty gas model, based on the Maxwell–Stefan equations, was used to describe transport through the porous stainless-steel membrane. Two reactor configurations were investigated where either oxygen (PBMR-O) or ethylene (PBMR-E) permeated through the membrane, with the co-reactant fed to the catalyst bed. The model results were in good agreement with the experimental data. Simulations showed that the imposed pressure gradient resulted in predominantly convective flow through the membrane, which inhibited backdiffusion of components from the catalyst bed. The variables studied included reaction temperature and inlet reactant concentrations. The model results, as also demonstrated experimentally, confirmed that the PBMR-E is the best configuration, followed by the conventional fixed-bed reactor (FBR) and the PBMR-O, respectively.},

The model is composed of three main procedures: detachment of an existing sphere from a target sphere by moving its center to a new position, movement of an existing sphere to touch the target sphere, and addition of a new sphere to touch the target sphere. Each procedure is performed to satisfy a constrained nonlinear optimization formulation. Input parameters include radius and coordination numbers density functions. A monodisperse and polydisperse packings were simulated by incorporating physically based properties of glass bead packings obtained from 3D computed tomography images. In each simulated system, the packing density obtained was very close to the packing density of the physical system. The packings were tested for isotropy, homogeneity and randomness and then compared to experimental microtomography images. Findings indicate that the packings generated were isotropic, homogenous, random, and in a good agreement with the experimental data.},

The membrane performance attributes were evaluated by the water permeability, and rejection of methyl orange dye. We observed in the results that, with the addition of kCg, an asymmetric membrane structure was formed owing to the accelerated demixing process that resulted from the increase in hydrophilicity of the composite PVDF/kCg. The smooth surface, increased hydrophilicity, and negatively charged surface of the composite PVDF/kCg membrane resulted in strong resistance in adhering to a dye; therefore, the resulting composite membranes had a higher dye rejection and water permeability.

The hydrodynamics of two-phase flows are computed using COMSOL Multiphysics software and a moving mesh approach to track the interface. Gas-liquid mass transfer is then solved, by varying the diffusion coefficient. Surprisingly, this work shows that the global Sherwood number Sh\infty{} plateaus with the P\'{e}clet number Pe when it is larger than 1000, which was not previously reported. Local Sherwood numbers for transfer through the film (Shbf) and the caps (Shbs) allow to distinguish their contributions. Shbf evolves as given by the falling film theory, whereas Shbs follows the penetration theory only at moderate P\'{e}clet number. A dimensionless correlation to predict Sh\infty{} gathers results from contrasted configurations: Sh\infty{} is mainly sensitive to both Pe (before saturation) and the gas hold-up ϵG. The benefit of working with unit cells of small ϵG in milli-reactors is therefore highlighted.},

  abstract      = {Addressing the urgent need to reduce global CO2 emissions, there is a growing emphasis on transitioning from the current fossil fuel-dependent energy system to an environmentally sustainable hydrogen-based economy, devoid of carbon emissions. However, the inherent challenges in the conventional storage and transportation of elemental hydrogen have impeded progress. To overcome this hurdle and achieve a seamless transition to a cost-effective hydrogen storage solution, researchers propose the use of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). These carriers involve chemically binding elemental hydrogen within hydrogen-deficient organic molecules, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of hydrogen under low pressure conditions. An attractive feature of LOHCs is their compatibility with existing infrastructure such as storage tanks, ships, and fueling stations, facilitating a smoother transition. This contribution delves into the crucial role of various catalyst materials in enhancing the hydrogenation activity of various LOHCs such as benzene, toluene, N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) and dibenzyltoluene (DBT). Through the exploration of catalytic aspects, this review investigates the effect of noble metal, transition metal, and multimetallic catalysts, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization. These efforts aim to achieve efficient and sustainable hydrogen storage within the LOHC framework. The findings presented in this study aim to contribute to the development of economically viable solutions for hydrogen storage and utilization, thereby aiding the seamless transition toward a hydrogen-based energy economy.},

To investigate the effect of particle sizes, two beds with particles sized 10.0–12.5 and 12.5–16.0~mm were characterized and numerically reconstructed using the discrete element method. While to assess the effect of particle shapes, a third numerical bed was generated directly upon a high-resolution CT-scan of a real bed. Through reactive CFD simulations, we investigated the reduction process in these three beds using hydrogen as the reducing gas. Our findings reveal that the bed structure significantly impacts the reduction efficiency and overall conversion degree.

  abstract      = {In the pursuit of more sustainable steelmaking, stakeholders are engaging in a transformative exploration of hydrogen-based direct reduction as an alternative to conventional blast furnaces. As a bridging step between single iron ore pellets and industrial shaft furnaces, direct reduction modeling in a fixed bed configuration can play a central role for subsequent process optimization. However, this task involves numerous challenging steps: generation of a realistic packed bed structure along with a good quality mesh and, foremost, reliable transport and kinetic processes for the individual pellets. Therefore, the present work formulates a sound methodology to progress from single particle considerations to 3D-CFD simulations of iron ore reduction using hydrogen in fixed beds, further supported by validations regarding the bed structure and the overall reduction against experimental data from the literature of a 500~g iron ore bed. The current results offer new insights into the direct reduction process, revealing, for instance, the non-uniform reduction of pellets within the bed, the presence of gas pockets, or the importance of the temperature deviation due to the endothermic reduction of iron oxides with hydrogen.},

This study uses the oscillatory flow reactor with smooth periodic constrictions (OFR-SPC) according to the patent EP3057694 (B1) to evaluate its potential on O2 mass transfer at high solids loading (10–50~\% (v/v)). For that, the effect of solids (EPS, PVC) properties (concentration, density, and size) on the performance of the volumetric liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (kLa), gas holdup (\ensuremath{\epsilon}G) and Sauter mean bubble diameter (d32) using several operational conditions (oscillation amplitude and frequency, superficial gas velocity) was assessed. Results show that oscillatory conditions can influence the solids effect on kLa. At solid load (\geq{} 30~\% (v/v)) under low oscillations, kLa decreased, \ensuremath{\epsilon}G and d32 increased, slug flow regime emerged and the OFR-SPC behaved as fixed bed reactor. Contrary, no significant influence of solid properties on kLa, and \ensuremath{\epsilon}G was observed at higher oscillations, where the reactor behaved as fluidized bed in a homogeneous flow regime. Notably, solids' concentration ({$<$}30~\% (v/v)), size and density revealed a negligible influence on mass transfer for all range of oscillations, contrary to the widespread consensus where kLa tends to decrease in conventional reactors at lower solid's load ({\$<\$}15~\% (v/v)), making the OFR-SPC a valuable resource for catalytic processes. The OFR-SPC demonstrated higher mass transfer rates (\sim{}3 - fold) than conventional multiphase devices with reasonable power consumption (\sim{}100~W/m-3(-\vert{}-)). These are remarkable results, which indicate the OFR-SPC for three-phase industrial processes intensification.},

  abstract      = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics of gas–solid flow in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser at various fluidization conditions using the Eulerian–Granular multiphase model. The model was evaluated comprehensively by comparing its predictions with experimental results reported for a CFB riser operating at various solid mass fluxes and superficial gas velocities. The model was capable of predicting the main features of the complex gas–solids flow, including the cluster formation of the solid phase along the walls, for different operating conditions. The model also predicted the coexistence of up-flow in the lower regions and downward flow in the upper regions at the wall of the riser for high gas velocity and solid mass flux, as reported in the literature. The predicted solid volume fraction and axial particle velocity were in good agreement with the experimental data within the high density fast fluidization regime. However, the model showed some discrepancy in predicting the gas–solid flow behavior in the riser operating in dense suspension up-flow and low density fast fluidization regimes.},

The implementation of correct inlet conditions was found to be critical for the successful simulation of the hydrodynamics. The simulated profiles of gas and solid velocity and volume fraction were overall in good agreement with experimental data reported in the literature. However, due to the difficulties in accurate modeling of the solid segregation toward the wall, the solid volume fraction was under predicted near the walls. The effect of modeling parameters including different drag models, wall restitution coefficient values, and solid slip conditions have been evaluated. While the wall restitution coefficient did not exhibit a significant effect on the riser hydrodynamics, the appropriate slip condition aided in predicting the solid segregation toward the wall.},

  abstract      = {In recent years several processes incorporating a carbonation–calcination loop in an interconnected fluidized bed reactor have been proposed as a way to capture CO2 from flue gases. This paper is a first approximation to the modelling of a fluidized bed carbonator reactor. In this reactor the flue gas comes into contact with an active bed composed of particles with very different activities, depending on their residence time in the bed and in the carbonation–calcination loop. The model combines the residence time distribution functions with existing knowledge about sorbent deactivation rates and sorbent reactivity. The fluid dynamics of the solids (CSTR) and gases (PF) in the carbonator are based on simple assumptions. The carbonation rates are modelled defining a characteristic time for the transition between a fast reaction regime to a regime with a zero reaction rate. On the basis of these assumptions the model is able to predict the CO2 capture efficiency for the flue gas depending on the operating and design conditions. Operating windows with high capture efficiencies are discussed, as well as those conditions where only modest capture efficiencies are possible.},

Results showed that calcination of magnesite powder at 850–1000~\textdegree{}C is a quick reaction, allowing 99\% of its containing MgCO3 to be decomposed in 1–2~s. Activity of product from the transport bed flash calcination (TBFC) is obviously higher than that from fixed bed calcination. Product activity depends on both decomposition rate and microstructure. During calcination, the surface structure of product changes from loose and porous to dense and smooth, even in a few seconds. A recently commissioned commercial TBFC plant indeed produced the light-burned magnesia according to the anticipation of this study, and it only requires a fuel consumption about 40~\% lower than that of conventional reverberatory furnace.},

The FSLBM uses a volume of fluid approach to reduce the problem of a liquid–gas two-phase flow to a single-phase free surface simulation. In bubbly flows compression effects leading to an increase or decrease of pressure in the suspended bubbles cannot be neglected. Therefore, the free surface simulation is augmented by a bubble model that supplies the missing information by tracking the topological changes of the free surface in the flow. The new model presented here is capable of handling the effects of bubble breakup and coalesce without causing a significant computational overhead. Thus, the enhanced bubble model extends the applicability of the FSLBM to a new range of practically relevant problems, like bubble formation and development in chemical reactors or foaming processes.},

Assessment of pressure, voidage, and bubbling properties allows for a new description of turbulent fluidization hydrodynamics. Appreciable changes in the hydrodynamics appear well below the transition criterion U               c               , determined based on pressure fluctuations: bubbles are fast bubbles below U               c               , in bubble–emulsion equilibrium state at U               c               , and then become slow bubbles for higher fluidizing velocity; the maximum of the total fluidizing gas fraction in the bubble phase is reached below U               c               and never exceeds 75–80\%. The fluidizing velocity at which major modifications in hydrodynamics are observed is lower than U               c               . This critical velocity is detected with pressure drop assessment or frequency analysis of voidage fluctuations. Moreover, it can be theoretically calculated from the two-phase modeling correlations supplemented with a new criterion deduced from our experiments. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2005}

Air (density 1.2 kg/m3, dynamic viscosity 1.8 \texttimes{} 10-5 Pa s) and typical FCC particles (density 1400 kg/m3, mean diameter 70 ␮m) are used. The superficial gas velocity is kept constant at 7 m/s while the solid mass flux ranges from 46 to 133 kg/m2 s. The axial dispersion of the solid phase is found to decrease when increasing the solid mass flux. Simultaneously, 3D transient CFD simulations are performed to conclude on the usability of the eulerian–eulerian approach for the prediction of the solid phase mixing in the riser. The numerical investigation of the solid mixing is deferred until later since the near-wall region where the solid phase downflow and mixing are predominant is not well predicted in spite of well-predicted vertical profiles of pressure.},

  abstract      = {\DH{}A power plant based on chemical-looping combustion oers both a possibility of high net power eciency and separation of the greenhouse gas CO2. This is due to the way the oxidation of the fuel takes place. Instead of oxidizing the fuel with oxygen from the combustion air, the fuel is oxidized by an oxygen carrier, i.e., an oxygen-containing compound. The oxygen carriers that have been suggested in previous studies are metal oxides like NiO, Fe2O3 and Mn3O4. The reduced oxygen carrier is in the next step reoxidized by air in a second reactor and then recirculated to the \textregistered{}rst reactor. In this way, fuel and air are never mixed and the fuel oxidation products CO2 and water leave the system undiluted by air. All that is needed to get an almost pure CO2 product is to condense the water vapour and remove the liquid water.},

  abstract      = {Fluidized bed combustion can be used for energy production or incineration for almost any material containing carbon, hydrogen and sulphur in a combustible form, whether it be in the form of a solid, liquid, slurry or gas. The technology's fuel flexibility arises from the fact that the fuel is present in the combustor at a low level and is burnt in the mass of a thermally inert bed material (typically this is limestone if sulphur capture is required, otherwise sand). However, fuel flexibility must either be built into the design of the combustor or alternatively the FBC system must be tailored for a specific fuel or combination of fuels. In addition, the designer must consider issues like heat release patterns, ash characteristics (particularly if the ash has any potential for agglomeration or fouling of heat transfer surfaces or blockage of the return valve in the case of a circulating FBC) and any special requirements of the fuel such as the need for sulphur or HCl capture. This paper surveys the literature on some of the more important alternative fuels and also makes specific recommendations about problems or major issues with those fuels. Particular attention is given to the use of FBC for petroleum coke, coal wastes, wood pulp sludges, and biomass residues. These fuels are emphasized because of their current economic importance, particularly in North America.},

However, despite more than 30 years of intensive study of sulfation processes in atmospheric FBC boilers and numerous laboratory studies, there are still many uncertainties and disagreements on the subject. In particular, the mechanisms of the sulfation reaction are still not properly understood, and there is dispute over the explanation of the well-known temperature maximum for optimum sulfur capture found in FBC boilers. This paper discusses these points of contention and suggests the most probable mechanisms and explanations for the various phenomena seen with sulfur capture, based on current literature and personal experimentation. ᭧ 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract      = {Continuous crystallization plays a pivotal role in the transition to continuous manufacturing that the pharmaceutical industry is currently undertaking. Alas, the development of a continuous crystallization process using data from continuous operation is prohibitively material-intensive. Given the state of control nature of the continuous formalism, experimental design spaces entail several experiments, in which up to ten residence times are required to assess an experimental condition at steady state. Furthermore, transferring batch kinetics determined from batch experiments to a continuous crystallizer, despite being common practice, adds undesirable uncertainty to the development endeavors due to equipment-dependent mass and heat transfer. In this work, we present a novel configuration of a tubular crystallizer, capable of characterizing a system with a few experiments, curbing the reactor footprint, and abating the development's raw material requirements. A stream of crystallizing material, flowing inside a tubular crystallizer equipped with Kenics static mixers, was fully recirculated, implementing a looped plug flow configuration, and its evolution was monitored in-line continuously by means of in situ Process Analytical Technologies. This allows effective mimicking of long residence times (which correspond to large process volumes) in a short plug flow crystallizer while maintaining plug flow conditions and screening a process from nucleation to equilibrium. Computational fluid dynamics simulations supported the assumption of negligible back mixing and aided the comparison of the mixing with that of a cascade of continuous stirred tank reactors. The use of the novel configuration is showcased for the antisolvent crystallizations of ketoconazole, azithromycin, and glycine. Using this approach, we show reductions in raw material requirements from 50 to 98\%, compared with an equivalent standard plug flow crystallizer. Naturally, the configuration can also be employed for manufacturing in a semicontinuous manner.},

  abstract      = {A numerical formulation for Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations of particle-laden flows in complex geometries is developed. The formulation accounts for the finite-size of the dispersed phase. Similar to the commonly used point-particle formulation, the dispersed particles are treated as point-sources, and the forces acting on the particles are modeled through drag and lift correlations. In addition to the inter-phase momentum exchange, the presence of particles affects the fluid phase continuity and momentum equations through the displaced fluid volume. Three flow configurations are considered in order to study the effect of finite particle size on the overall flowfield: (a) gravitational settling, (b) fluidization by a gaseous jet, and (c) fluidization by lift in a channel. The finite-size formulation is compared to point-particle representations, which do not account for the effect of finite-size. It is shown that the fluid displaced by the particles plays an important role in predicting the correct behavior of particle motion. The results suggest that the standard point-particle approach should be modified to account for finite particle size, in simulations of particle-laden flows.},

  abstract      = {Computation of a turbulent dilute gas–solid channel flow has been undertaken to study the influence of using wallcorrected drag coefficients and of the lift force on the dispersed phase characteristics. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations governing the carrier flow were solved by using a direct numerical simulation approach and coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking. Calculations were performed at Reynolds number based on the wall-shear velocity and channel half-width, Res \% 184, and for three different sets of solid particles. For each particle set, two cases were examined, in the first one the particle motion was governed by both drag and lift wall-corrected forces, whereas in the other one, the standard drag force (not corrected) was solely acting. The lift force model used represents the most accurate available expression since it accounts for weak and strong shear as well as for wall effects. For this study, we considered elastic collisions for particles contacting the walls and that no external forces were acting. Present results indicate that the use of the lift force and of the drag corrections does not lead to significant changes in the statistical properties of the solid phase, at the exception of some statistics for the high inertia particles.},

In four studies, we investigated the impact of flipped courses - an innovating teaching method (vs. classic teaching) - and of three innovative test formats - journal format report (vs. classic report), research article analysis and exam with all documents authorised (vs. classic exam) - on the motivation and achievement of students taking applied chemistry courses at the Higher Institute of Applied Biology of Medenine, Tunisia. Students' motivation was increased by all new teaching approaches. Achievement scores were also significantly improved by these new methods, except for the exam with all documents authorized.

  abstract      = {This paper presents a phase-field based numerical study on the 3D formation of dendrites due to electrodeposition in an experimental-scale lithium metal battery. Small-scale 3D simulations were firstly conducted to elucidate the characteristics and resolution requirements of the numerical framework. Using a four-fold anisotropy model to simulate the growth of lithium deposition, the dependency of dendrite morphology on charging conditions (\ensuremath{\phi}b=-0.7V and \ensuremath{\phi}b=-1.4V) on a (larger) experimental-scale metal anode was demonstrated. The dendrite shape was found to shift from a smoother, tree-like formation at the lower applied voltage, to a more spike-like, highly branched structure at the higher voltage. The resulting morphological parameters, such as dendrite propagation rates, volume-specific area, and side branching rates, were compared against published experimental data and found to be comparable to the reported ranges for the electrodeposition of spike- or tree-like metal dendrites. This finding supports our previous observation that dendrite formation is connected to the competition between the lithium cation diffusion and electric migration, generating an uneven distribution of Li+ on the electrode surface. This observation also gives insight into dendrite inhibition strategies focusing on enhancing the diffusion of lithium ions to achieve a more uniform concentration field on the anode surface.},

The aim of this review is to evaluate and elucidate the scientific evidence on the use of green technologies to extract bioactive compounds from Brassica by-products with potential application in developing new foods. Scopus was used to search for indexed studies in JCR-ISI journals, while books, reviews, and non-indexed JCR journals were excluded. Broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, mustard, and radish, among others, have been deeply reviewed. Ultrasound and microwave-assisted extraction have been mostly used, but there are relevant studies using enzymes, supercritical fluids, ultrafiltration, or pressurized liquids that report a great extraction effectiveness and efficiency. However, predictive models must be developed to optimize the extraction procedures. Extracted biocompounds can be used, free or encapsulated, to develop, reformulate, and/or fortify new foods as a good tool to enhance healthiness while preserving their quality (nutritional, functional, and sensory) and safety. In the age of recycling and energy saving, more studies must evaluate the efficiency of the processes, the cost, and the environmental impact leading to the production of new foods and the sustainable extraction of phytochemicals.},

Here, we report that by charging a scaled coin-cell prototype with 1 ms pulses followed by 3 ms rest periods the average dendrite length is shortened \sim{}2.5 times relative to those grown under continuous charging. Monte Carlo simulations dealing with Li+ diffusion and electromigration reveal that experiments involving 20 ms pulses were ineffective because Li+ migration in the strong electric fields converging to dendrite tips generates extended depleted layers that cannot be replenished by diffusion during rest periods. Because the application of pulses much shorter than the characteristic time \ensuremath{\tau}c \sim{} O(\sim{}1 ms) for polarizing electric double layers in our system would approach DC charging, we suggest that dendrite propagation can be inhibited (albeit not suppressed) by pulse charging within appropriate frequency ranges.},

The HEAM demonstrated that lowering the electrode compression and enhancing the channel area lowers the pump power loss independent of the flow fields and electrodes. Additionally, the HEAM helped elucidate the deficiencies of flow distribution in interdigitated flow fields (IFFs) and suggested designing wider manifolds and/or shorter channels improve the flow distribution. Moreover, the HEAM suggested shallower and/or wider channels, and more permeable electrodes enhance the flow penetration rate above the channels. Finally, the HEAM showed that the average penetration depth in the electrode above the ribs (hpen) was the critical parameter in the fluid-flow modeling of IFFs and was inversely proportional to the permeability. Hence, there is a trade-off between the pump power loss and hpen when configuring electrode permeability.},

  abstract      = {Protein hydrolysates have become key ingredients in food sector that govern both nutritional and functional behavior of food systems. However, the hydrolysate powders in general are hygroscopic in nature making them unstable. The powder properties may vary under different processing and drying conditions which can further influence the powder stability. Thus, the study explores the effect of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) pretreatment and drying conditions on stability and microstructure of egg white protein hydrolysate (EWPH) powder for wider food application. The HC-pretreated EWPH powder obtained from two different drying methods, namely, freeze and vacuum drying, was assessed for their stability at elevated temperatures of 25, 35, 40, 45, and 55~\textdegree{}C for moisture sorption isotherm analysis. The sorption isotherms of EWPH were found to have a typical type III sigmoid curve, representing a hygroscopic material that fitted the GAB model well. The HC-treated EWPHs did not have much variation with temperature showing better stability. The density of vacuum-dried samples was higher by\,\textasciitilde\,50\% compared to freeze-dried samples. From DSC, it was confirmed that HC aided in improving the stability of freeze-dried EWPH powder where the highest denaturation temperature was found as 106.2~\textdegree{}C. Overall, a lower temperature of 25~\textdegree{}C and a relative humidity of 40\% were found suitable for maintaining the stability of EWPH powder. Moreover, the study demonstrated that a pretreatment like HC had profound effect in enhancing the stability of protein hydrolysate powder, especially after freeze drying.},

  abstract      = {Among all of the lithium-bearing minerals, spodumene possesses the highest theoretical lithium abundance. Since the 1990s, Australia, with the world's largest spodumene (LiAl(SiO3)2) reserves, has been producing lithium as a mineral concentrate rather than a refined product. Nevertheless, the country is now moving forward to fortify its processing facilities, aligning with the vision for greener energy. This review provides a comprehensive outlook on the current status of spodumene reserves and their processing facilities along with potential expansion in the future. Spodumene processing requires several metallurgical processes ranging from salt roasting to acid leaching. However, the conventional industrial practices for Li-extraction from ores result in excessive pressure on resources, energy, and waste management. Considering these factors as an indicator of a circular economy, the process of lithium extraction should be simplified. In such a context, different practices for Li-extraction from spodumene are exemplified by recent technological advancements. Afterward, strategies for decarbonization, waste management, and environmental aspects were provided, with a perspective of circular economy. This review is expected to serve as a reference for research and development for potential industrial applications in ore processing especially for spodumene.},

  abstract      = {With increasing the diversity of electronic/electric appliances and large-scale energy storage systems, high-energy-density based device technology has been in great demand. Meanwhile, for developing of high-voltage and high-capacity cathode, the use of metals including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), or zinc (Zn) is quite impressive to replace the traditional anodes with low capacity upper limit such as graphite, silicon carbon, and hard carbon which is considered as ``holy grail'' strategy to explore high-energy density systems. However, these so-called metal batteries (MBs) also face many thorny issues including high anode reactivity, dendritic growth, and high safety risks. Among all these muddle, the dendrite growth is quite sever issue and has attracted much attention of many recognized materials scientist and battery researchers. The formation of dendrite increase the surface area of metal anodes, induce the rupture and reconstruction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, which is likely to accelerate the excessive consumption of electrolyte and the formation of dead metals. Consequently, battery lose its capability and short circuit produced which causes serious safety issues. Therefore, it is badly needed to inhibit or even eliminate the formation of dendrites during the repeated charge and discharge process to find advanced and fast battery technology. In this review, we summarize the basic mechanistic theoretical models about dendrites formation and their effects on the battery performance. Moreover, we recapitulate the reported literature about dendrites concept and their solution from battery invention to its modernism for smart electric appliances and zero emission electric vehicles. Besides, perspective of interface energy/volume stress, several innovative strategies for restraining, regulating and eliminating dendrites are also part of this review. Finally, perspectives conclusions for the development of MBs about dendrite level are given for the progress of future battery science.},

  abstract      = {The discrete element model DMX was used to simulate the settling behavior of a unique particle in an assembly of other particles in a hopper lling process. No uid effects or cohesive forces were modeled so the results are applicable for non-cohesive particles with diameters greater than about 1 mm where air effects can be neglected. No vibration or other such external load was included. The settling behavior of the unique particle was investigated in terms of the density ratio and the diameter ratio, and of varying conditions of chronological entry position, initial assembly velocity and system friction. The model showed satisfactory agreement with several observations reported regarding this behavior. The model demonstrated that at a high density ratio `sinking' is dominant irrespective of the size of the particle, initial position or initial velocity, whereas a balance between particle size and density determine whether a particle sinks or rises at other densities. Based on this, a preliminary phase diagram was derived showing when a particle will sink or rise or do neither (termed `neutral') as a function of particle size and diameter ratios. The model also showed that the initial position has only a qualifying effect on the behavior of the unique particle and the initial velocity is only signi cant at low-density ratios where with higher velocities the lighter particle will rise more. At lower friction these effects are enhanced. Repeating some simulation runs on larger binary systems showed that these effects could cause some segregation during settling.},

In order to generate irregular particle arrangements within the reactors, a modified ballistic deposition method is used. While our previous studies were focused on pressure drop and mass transfer characteristics, the present paper uses the same framework to investigate the dispersion phenomena occurring in such reactors. Two different methods, namely the tracer and the post-processing method, are applied. The first method imitates the experimental procedure in which a non-diffusive tracer is injected into the packed bed. The residence time can be evaluated from the evolution of the tracer concentration. The second method is purely numerical and allows fast residence time estimation. Simulation results are successfully validated against experimental data from literature. The suggested numerical analysis is a valuable tool toward a deeper understanding of the fundamental transport phenomena in such reactors and, consequently, for the improvement of the packed bed performance.},

  abstract      = {The field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) combines a broad range of methods to study materials' responses over a spectrum of length scales. A relatively unexplored aspect of microstructure-sensitive materials design is uncertainty propagation and quantification (UP/UQ) of materials' microstructure, as well as establishing process-structure–property (PSP) relationships for inverse material design. In this study, an efficient UP technique built on the idea of changing probability measures and a deep generative unsupervised representative machine learning method for microstructure-based design of thermal conductivity of materials is proposed. Probability measures are used to represent microstructure space, and Wasserstein metrics are used to test the efficiency of the UP method. By using deep Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), we identify the correlations between the material/process parameters and the thermal conductivity of heterogeneous dual-phase microstructures. Through high-throughput screening, UP, and the deep-generative VAE method, PSP relationships that are too complex can be revealed by exploiting the materials' design space with an emphasis on microstructures. As a last point, we demonstrate generative machine learning serves as a useful tool for inverse microstructure-centered materials design, and we demonstrate this by examining the inverse design of thermal conductivity in nano-structured materials. The results reveal the effects of morphology, volume fraction, characteristic length scale, and the individual thermal diffusivity of phases on the thermal conductivity of dual-phase alloys. Our findings emphasize the advantages of high-throughput phase-field modeling and generative deep learning for linking PSP and inverse microstructure-centered materials design.},

This makes it relevant to search for modern, more effective technologies and equipment, the use of which will significantly increase overall production productivity, reduce overall specific energy consumption, improve the quality of the finished products and safety of processes for the environment. The paper analyzes and generalizes methods for intensifying extraction processes from plant materials. The most effective ways to intensify hydrodynamic processes include methods based on cavitation phenomena. ~Transformation and redistribution of energy, which occur during the formation and collapse of vapor bubbles due to the creation of a high difference in pressure, temperature, and potential, contribute to a significant increase in the efficiency of dynamic effects on complex heterogeneous systems during extraction. Cavitation technologies ensure ecological purity and safety of the process, make it possible to accelerate mass transfer processes, activate the extractant, obtain a high yield of biologically active substances (BAS) and maintain their properties. Acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation are most commonly used. Modern research is conducted in search of new solutions to optimize technologies, as well as improvement of cavitation equipment. Examples of hydrodynamic cavitation devices of static and dynamic types are cylindrical and disk rotor-pulsation devices, valve-type high-pressure homogenizers, pulsating dispersers, centrifugal pumps and Venturi tubes. They are used to intensify the processes at the stages of preparation of plant raw materials, activation of the extractant, as well as the extraction itself. Static-type cavitation devices based on the Venturi tube have a number of advantages in terms of design, technological and economic solution.},

The two-phase theory was shown generally not to apply in the slugging and the higher velocity fluidization regimes. A modified Richardson-Zaki approach, using an `effective' cluster terminal velocity, was shown to adequately describe bed expansion. Changes in slope of the expansion curve were associated with regime changes, and can prove useful for the analysis of large diameter fluid beds.

  abstract      = {The breakup of solid aggregates suspended in a turbulent flow is considered. The aggregates are assumed to be small with respect to the Kolmogorov length scale and the flow is assumed to be homogeneous. Further, it is assumed that breakup is caused by hydrodynamic stresses acting on the aggregates, and breakup is therefore assumed to follow a first-order kinetic where               K                                B                              (               x               ) is the breakup rate function and               x               is the aggregate mass. To model               K                                B                              (               x               ), it is assumed that an aggregate breaks instantaneously when the surrounding flow is violent enough to create a hydrodynamic stress that exceeds a critical value required to break the aggregate. For aggregates smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale the hydrodynamic stress is determined by the viscosity and local energy dissipation rate whose fluctuations are highly intermittent. Hence, the first-order breakup kinetics are governed by the frequency with which the local energy dissipation rate exceeds a critical value (that corresponds to the critical stress). A multifractal model is adopted to describe the statistical properties of the local energy dissipation rate, and a power-law relation is used to relate the critical energy dissipation rate above which breakup occurs to the aggregate mass. The model leads to an expression for               K                                B                              (               x               ) that is zero below a limiting aggregate mass, and diverges for               x               \rightarrow{} \infty{}. When simulating the breakup process, the former leads to an asymptotic mean aggregate size whose scaling with the mean energy dissipation rate differs by one third from the scaling expected in a non-fluctuating flow.},

The mean protein content of lupin was significantly higher compared to pea (P~{$<~$}0.001) and similar to soya bean, whereas the proportion of calculated carbohydrates was lowest for lupin (P~{\$<~\$}0.001). The content of total dietary fibre and of calculated soluble fibre was higher for lupin compared to pea (P~\leq{}~0.003) and soya bean (P~\leq{}~0.013). In contrast to the existing literature, the soluble fibre content of lupin contributed about 75\% of the total dietary fibre. In conclusion, dehulled lupin seeds can be considered as a valuable source of plant protein and dietary fibre, while simultaneously being low in carbohydrates. Therefore, lupin should be exploited more efficiently within human and also animal nutrition. In further studies, the impact of dehulling lupin seeds and of using different methodologies in fibre analyses on the results of chemical composition should be elucidated.},

From a comparative analysis of the different computational approaches available for turbulent multiphase flows it is argued that the point–particle approach is uniquely suited to address turbulent multiphase flows where the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of particle time scale to Kolmogorov time scale \dh{}sp=sk\TH{}, is greater than 1. The Stokes number estimate has been used to establish parameter range where point–particle approach is ideally suited. The point–particle approach can be extended to handle ``finite-sized'' particles whose diameter approach that of the smallest resolved eddies. However, new challenges arise in the implementation of Lagrangian–Eulerian coupling between the particles and the carrier phase. An approach where the inter-phase momentum and energy coupling can be separated into a deterministic and a stochastic contribution has been suggested.},

Producing second generation biofuels is even more challenging than producing first generation biofuels due the complexity of the biomass and issues related to producing, harvesting, and transporting less dense biomass to centralized biorefineries. In addition to this logistic challenge, other challenges with respect to processing steps in converting biomass to liquid transportation fuel like pretreatment, hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, and fuel separation still exist and are discussed in this review. The possible coproducts that could be produced in the biorefinery and their importance to reduce the processing cost of biofuel are discussed. About \$1 billion was spent in the year 2012 by the government agencies in US to meet the mandate to replace 30\% existing liquid transportation fuels by 2022 which is 36 billion gallons/year. Other countries in the world have set their own targets to replace petroleum fuel by biofuels. Because of the challenges listed in this review and lack of government policies to create the demand for biofuels, it may take more time for the lignocellulosic biofuels to hit the market place than previously projected.},

This engulfment--deformation--diffusion (EDD) model has been widely applied to interpret experiments showing an effect of mixing on the product distribution of the reactions between 1-naphthol and diazotized sulphanilic acid. Theoretical arguments and recent experimental results show how the EDD model can be simplified by neglecting deformation and diffusion provided that Sc \NestedLessLess{} 4000 and F \NestedLessLess{} 1. The new E model retains fluid engulfment as the rate-determining step in micromixing and contains no arbitrary parameters. Application to two complex reactions has shown that engulfment is also product determining, i.e. the product distribution does not depend on deformation and diffusion. The new E model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations; it is one to two orders of magnitude faster to compute and a wider choice of software is available for its numerical implementation. Micromixing calculations have been simplified and accelerated.},

  abstract      = {Improvement of operating conditions of existing circulating fluidised bed combustor units, as well as attempts to scale up present units to larger ones, are mainly based on empirical correlation or simplified scaling laws. Moreover, it is known that the details of the unit geometry \v{Z}entry and exit design, horizontal cross-section shape, secondary air location and configuration. have a great importance in the overall plant performance. Improvement of our understanding of the complex hydrodynamic behaviours involved in these processes requires refined and local physical models. The approach retained at the Laboratoire National d'Hydraulique of EDF for the prediction of the two-phase flows in complex geometries is based on the two-fluid model formalism, where both phases are characterised by their first velocity moments \v{Z}volumetric concentration, mean velocity and second order fluctuating velocity correlation tensors.. Separate transport equations are written for each moment with appropriate closure assumptions for unknown terms such as the momentum exchange between the two phases and the effective stress tensors of both phases.},

The technique allows densities to be obtained with an accuracy of 30 kg/m3 a t a spacial resolution less than 1.5 mm. This information combined with the density of the material fluidized allows direct determination of void fraction a t any location in the bed. The technique could be useful in the verification of fluid dynamics models as well as testing reactor designs. The CT technique has shown the presence of bypass regions which are generally undesirable since they decrease gas-solid contact. CT scanning of model reactors could be a very useful technique to obtain experimental verification of the flow patterns in reactors of different design as well as determining the effectiveness of baffles in eliminating bypassing. A second benefit of the CT technique is the ability to take vertical cross sections a t different locations, i.e., at a diameter and then along several cords parallel to the diameter. This procedure would allow examination of increasing wall effects.},

Oils and waxes have been found to be promising solutions for wood protection. This study elucidates the use of paraffin wax based emulsions incorporated with cerium oxide nanoparticles to improve weathering performance of wood. For this purpose, paraffin wax nanoemulsions were prepared by ultrasonication method using tween 80 as surfactant. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (conc. 0.5- to 2\%) were added to provide protection against degradation caused by solar UV radiation. The storage stability of nano emulsion was assessed over a period of 30 days by measuring effective particle size and zeta potential. The microstructure of nanoemulsions was observed by optical microscopy and distribution of CeO2 nanoparticles on coated wood was observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical changes were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Wood specimens of Pinus radiata coated with nanoemulsions were subjected to the accelerated weathering tests for 500h. The time dependent changes in surface color of uncoated and coated wood samples were examined. Moreover, the chemical changes on exposed wood surfaces were analyzed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Stable and homogenous nanoemulsions with particle diameter between 200 and 400~nm were formed and exhibited excellent storage stability. Results of color changes showed that maximum degradation was observed in uncoated wood whereas wood coated with paraffin wax nanoemulsion alone could not improve the UV resistance. However, the addition of cerium oxide nanoparticles proved to be efficient in controlling the color changes on wood surfaces. The degradation of wood components reduced significantly in cerium oxide coated wood which was confirmed by FTIR results.},

  abstract      = {Hydrogen is one of the key components in renewable energy systems. Its storage and transport, however, are challenging. The Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) technology is a possible solution for this issue. With suitable organic components, hydrogen can be stored in a chemically bound form which is safer and has a higher energy density than other solutions. Furthermore, the storage and transport of the LOHC component with high hydrogen content can be provided under normal environmental conditions. The LOHC process cycle involves a catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation step where the LOHC component can be recovered and recycled. The paper reviews a few relevant studies regarding the possible LOHC compound pairs, the potential catalyst systems, and the necessary equipment. Then, the paper discusses a simulation study of three LOHC systems, determining suitable operating conditions and estimating costs. The toluene-methylcyclohexane system was found to be the most promising for LOHC application. Two energy integration opportunities were also examined. The first case study was based on separate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation sites, while the second was based on one site utilization. The results show a lower energy demand in the case of a toluene system, with a reduction of 70\% in heating and 45\% in cooling.},

  abstract      = {In fluidized bed reactors, gas bubbles greatly affect bed expansion, particle elutriation, heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical conversion. Accurate predictions of bubble size and velocity are, therefore, essential for the reliable design and successful operation of fluidized bed reactors. Direct measurement of bubble properties with X-rays cannot be used with large units. Although probes could be used, they interfere with the bubbles and cannot provide accruate results. A technique was, therefore, developed to measure the average rise velocity of the gas bubbles through a fluidized bed. A gas tracer such as helium is injected in the gas distributor holes, at the bottom of the bed. A small flowrate of gas-solid mixture was sampled from just above the bed surface at a velocity high enough to ensure turbulent flow in the sampling tube. Calibration runs showed that signal degradation was minimal. The average bubble velocity was determined from the speed at which a helium concentration step traveled from the bottom to the top of the bed. These results were confirmed with bed expansion and TDH measurements. The best predictions were obtained with Darton's correlation for bubble size and the correlation from Hilligardt and Werther for bubble velocity.},

It was seen that the ratio of the perimeter of the venturi to the cross-sectional area of its constriction quantifies the possible location of the inception of the cavity. The ratio of the throat length to its height (in the case of a slit venturi) controls the maximum size of the cavity and the angle of the divergence section controls the rate of collapse of a cavity. Based on the numerical study, it was concluded that a slit venturi (\ensuremath{\alpha} = 2.7) with the slit length equal to its height (1:1) and a half angle of divergence section of 5.5\textdegree{} is an optimum geometry for best cavitational activity.},

TGA showed stability at 99\textdegree{}C and complete degradation at 372\textdegree{}C. Chemical characterization of IDF extract showed a reduction in protein and fat, thus improving purity and IDF content. Tested technique also improved functional properties like cation exchange capacity (meq/kg) 16.30–17.66, emulsifying capacity (\%) 32.1–32.98, and swelling capacity (ml/g) 4.43–5.98 to a high level. Briefly, under-tested extraction parameters, the IDF has improved chemical and functional characteristics. Practical applications The study concludes that ultrasonic extraction, under-explored moderate, and optimized conditions will prove an efficient extraction technique yielding considerable quantity and quality of IDF from wheat bran. The above results show the possibility for the application of all tested samples of IDFs in the food industry, especially to expand the thermal stability of food for various purposes. The ultrasonically extracted IDFs have better structural integrity and functional characteristics which play an important part in preparation and quality maintenance of food products, especially cereal food products.},

  abstract      = {Radial solids velocity profiles were computed on seven axial levels in the riser of a high-flux circulating fluidized bed (HFCFB) using a twophase 3-D computational fluid dynamics model. The computed solids velocities were compared with experimental data on a riser with an internal diameter of 76 mm and a height of 10 m, at a high solids flux of 300 kg m\`{A}2 s\`{A}1 and a superficial velocity of 8 m s\`{A}1. Several hundreds of experimental and numerical studies on CFBs have been carried out at low fluxes of less than 200 kg m\`{A}2 s\`{A}1, whereas only a few limited useful studies have dealt with high solids flux. The k–e two-phase turbulence model was used to describe the gas–solids flow in an HFCFB. The model predicts a core–annulus flow in the dilute and developed flow regions similar to that found experimentally, but in the region of highest solids concentration it is somewhat overpredicted at the level close to the inlet.},

  abstract      = {The dryer feed chute of the pellet plant plays an important role in the pelletizing process. The chute discharges sticky and moist iron ore fines (\&lt;1\,mm) to the inline rotary dryer for further processing. Since the inception of the installation of the dryer feed chute, the poor flowability of the feed materials has caused severe problems such as blockages and excessive wear of chute liners. This leads to high maintenance costs and reduced lifetime of the liner materials. Constant housekeeping is needed for maintaining the chute and reliable operation. The purpose of this study is to redesign the dryer feed chute to overcome the above challenges.,The discrete element method (DEM) has been used to model the flow of cohesive materials through the transfer chute. Physical experiments have been performed to understand the most severe flow conditions. A DEM material model is also developed for replicating the worst-case material condition. After identifying the key problem areas, concept designs were proposed and simulated to assess the design improvements to increase the reliability of chute operation.,Flow simulations correlated well with the existing flow behavior of the iron ore fines inside the chute. The location of the problematic areas has been validated with that of the previously installed chute. Subsequently, design modifications have been proposed. This includes modification of deflector plate and change in slope and cross-section of the chute. DEM simulations and analysis were conducted after incorporating these design changes. A comparison in the average velocity of particle and force on chute wall shows a significant improvement using the proposed design.,Method to calibrate DEM material model was found to provide accurate prediction and modeling of the flow behavior of bulk material through the real transfer chute. DEM provided greater insight into the performance of the chute especially modeling cohesive materials. DEM is a valuable design tool to assist chute designers troubleshoot and verify chute designs. DEM provides a greater ability to model and assess chute wear. This technique can help in achieving a scientific understanding of the flow properties of bulk solids through transfer chute, hence eliminate challenges, ensuring reliable, uninterrupted and profitable plant operation. This paper strongly advocates the use of calibrated DEM methodology in designing bulk material handling equipment.},

  abstract      = {Tata Steel handles yearly several million tons of sinter for ironmaking. At present, a significant amount of the sinter produced becomes fines during handling and needs to be recycled. These fines are generated mainly during handling of sinter from the plant to the blast furnace, in particular inside transfer chutes. Repeated impact loading of particles against each other and against wall surfaces lead to their surface and body breakage and, thus, fines generation. The present work describes the calibration of a detailed breakage model of a sinter product, followed by model validation through simulation using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) in a simple laboratory handling system, besides a 14~m high, complex industrial-scale chute system. The full-scale validation consisted of comparing the final size distribution of material at the discharge belt of the transfer chute from the simulation using a commercial software (Altair EDEM) to results from an industrial survey, demonstrating reasonable agreement. In-depth analysis of the simulations made it possible to locate the problematic areas for the existing chute design, demonstrating the value of DEM not only to predict flow in chute systems, but also breakage and fines generation during sinter handling.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a novel dual-type industrial ethylene oxide reactor has been proposed with taking catalyst deactivation into account. The configuration of two catalyst beds instead of one single catalyst bed is developed for conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide. In the first reactor which is an industrial fixed-bed water-cooled reactor, the feed gas is partly converted to ethylene oxide. This reactor functions at very high yield and at a higher than normal operating temperature. In the second converter, the reaction heat is used to preheat the feed gas to the first reactor and a milder temperature profile is observed. The potential possibilities of a two-stage catalyst bed system are analyzed using a 1D heterogeneous dynamic model to obtain necessary comparative estimates. A differential evolution (DE) algorithm is applied as an effective and robust method to optimize the reactors length ratio. The results obtained from the simulation demonstrate that there is a desirable catalyst temperature profile along the dual-type reactor (DR) compared with the conventional single-type reactor (SR). In this way, the catalysts are exposed to less extreme temperatures and thus, diminishing the catalyst deactivation via sintering. Results from this study provided beneficial information about the effects of reactors configuration on catalyst lifetime and ethylene oxide production rate simultaneously.},

Mean cross-sectional solid volume fractions and radial profiles of solid-up are measured in the Cornell facility for two kinds of suspension, thus simulating a combustor of two different sizes.

To simulate the process and explore possible optimization, we developed a systemic, multiscale process model. The reduction of the iron ore pellets is described using a specific grain model, reflecting the transformations from hematite to iron. The shaft furnace is modeled as a set of interconnected one-dimensional zones into which the principal chemical reactions (3-step reduction, methane reforming, Boudouard and water gas shift) are accounted for with their kinetics. The previous models are finally integrated in a global, plant-scale, model using the Aspen Plus software. The reformer, scrubber, and heat exchanger are included. Results at the shaft furnace scale enlighten the role of the different zones according to the physico-chemical phenomena occurring. At the plant scale, we demonstrate the capabilities of the model to investigate new operating conditions leading to lower CO2 emissions.},

  abstract      = {In the past most poly-disperse spray models have been based on either discretising the liquid flow field into groups of equally sized droplets, as in the discrete droplet model (DDM) in which parcels of drops are tracked in space in a Lagrangian framework, or by solving separate Eulerian conservation equations for a number of size ranges. Both of these approaches can result in very long computing times, although the DDM is generally regarded as being superior in this respect under most conditions of interest. Recently an alternative approach to the modelling of sprays has been developed by Beck [Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 2000] and Beck and Watkins [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 2003]. In this approach the size information concerning the spray is obtained by solving conservation and transport equations for two moments of the drop number distribution, and their respective mean velocities, and obtaining two other moments from an assumed size distribution function. The sub-models required in this approach, for hydrodynamic phenomena in sprays, such as drop drag, break-up and collisions, have been presented elsewhere [Beck, Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 2000; Beck and Watkins, J. Comp. Phys., 2002]. The purpose of this paper is to present those sub-models relating to the mass and heat transfer processes in sprays. As part of this, an equation for the energy of the liquid phase is required. Standard gas phase equations, including a k–e turbulence model, are also solved. All the equations are solved in a Eulerian framework using the finite-volume approach. The inter-phase heat and mass transfers are captured through the use of source terms, and all the source terms for these aspects of the spray model are derived in this paper in terms of the four moments of the droplet number distribution in order to find the net effect on the whole spray flow field. The model has been applied to a wide variety of different sprays, including high-pressure diesel sprays, wide-angle solid cone water sprays, hollow cone sprays and evaporating sprays [Beck, Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 2000]. The comparisons of the results with experimental data show that the model generally performs well. In this paper the evaporation effects are examined and compared with experimental data wherever possible. Again this aspect of the spray model is shown to be generally successful.},

This paper describes the design and implementation of a spray model able to capture the full polydisperse nature of the spray flow without using droplet size classes. Instead, the moments of the droplet size distribution function are used to describe the distribution of droplet sizes. Transport equations are written for the two moments which represent the liquid mass and surface area, and two more moments representing total radius and droplet number are approximated via use of a presumed distribution function allowed to vary in space and time. The velocities to be used in the two transport equations are obtained by defining moment-average quantities and constructing further transport equations for the relevant moment-average velocities. An equation for the energy of the liquid phase and standard gas phase equations, including a k-\ensuremath{\epsilon} turbulence model, are also solved. All the equations are solved in an Eulerian framework using the finite-volume approach, and the phases are coupled through source terms. Effects such as droplet break-up and droplet-droplet collisions are also captured through the use of source terms, and all the source terms are derived in terms of the four moments of the droplet size distribution in order to find the net effect on the whole spray flow field.},

  abstract      = {The effect of gas phase velocity fluctuations on single droplet burning is investigated numerically. The main objective of this study is to understand the effect of gas phase turbulence on nitric oxide formation in single droplet flames. Since the interaction of gas phase velocity fluctuations with droplet burning is of sequential character, a separate investigation of droplet momentum coupling and droplet burning is performed. Momentum coupling controls droplet relaxation against changes of the gas phase velocity along the droplet trajectory and, thereby, determines to what extend gas phase velocity fluctuations translate into droplet slip velocity fluctuations. This coupling effect acts as a high pass filter with a cutoff frequency determined by the droplet Reynolds number and diameter. In the simulation of single droplet burning detailed models for chemical reaction, diffusive species transport and evaporation are used. A significant effect of slip velocity fluctuations on the mean values of NO formation rate is observed. The effect of slip velocity fluctuations on the mean NO formation rate is frequency dependent. The frequency response of the droplet flame is similar to that of a low pass filter. The droplet flame time scale characterizing the response to slip velocity fluctuations is found to correlate with chemical time scales. This time scale is not affected by droplet diameter.},

General correlations are given for predicting flame length over this range. The lower Reynolds ratio limit of the correlations has been determined. Under natural convection conditions flames of large base diameter are found to be rather short, and in these an effect of length to diameter ratio is apparent. Explanations have thus been found for the behavior of the pan fires of Blinov and Khudiakov. It has also been shown that flames in the forced convection limit are around 50\% longer than was previously suspected.},

It is generally understood that efficiency improvement that is consistent with high plant reliability and low cost of electricity is economically beneficial, but its effect upon reduction of all plant emissions without installation of additional environmental equipment, is less well appreciated. As CO2 emission control is gaining increasing acceptance, efficiency improvement, as the only practical tool capable of reducing CO2 emission from fossil fuel plant in the short term, has become a key concept for the choice of technology for new plant and upgrades of existing plant. Efficiency is also important for longer-term solutions of reducing CO2 emission by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS); it is essential for the underlying plants to be highly efficient so as to mitigate the energy penalty of CCS technology application. Power generating options, including coal-fired Rankine cycle steam plants with advanced steam parameters, natural gas-fired gas turbine-steam, and coal gasification combined cycle plants are discussed and compared for their efficiency, cost and operational availability. Special attention is paid to the timeline of the various technologies for their development, demonstration and commercial availability for deployment.},

Step perturbations of manipulated variables together with the process response provide valuable information for the study of system dynamics, the extent of interaction and control loop pairings.The first part of this study presents data from input perturbations gathered from a pilot-scale experimental oxygen VSA process.

The results indicate that considering two solid phases, particles with smaller diameters have lower volume fraction at the bottom of the bed and higher volume fraction at the top of the bed. In addition, it was revealed that bed expansion was larger when a bimodal particle mixture was applied compared with the case of mono-dispersed particles. Gas and solid phase temperature distributions in the reactor were also computed, considering the hydrodynamic of the fluidized bed and the heat generated by the solid particles. The results showed that gas temperature increases as it moves upward in the reactor due to the heat of polymerization reaction leading to the higher temperatures at the top of the bed.},

These differences were inevitably unfavorable. Particulate process plants take longer to start up and are less likely to achieve desired production rates. Facility operators often underestimate the challenges involved. These problems generally relate to an inadequate understanding of the behavior of particle systems. Many of these behaviors are sensitive to process scale or process history in ways that would not be expected by engineers familiar only with liquid or gas systems. Empiricism must often substitute for first principles. Modeling provides some answers, but often not enough to eliminate the need to operate pilot plants. This paper reviews some of the unit operations involved in particle processing and highlights scale-up issues involved. The use of information from suppliers and other third parties is discussed, as well as scale-up strategies in competitive or regulated industries.},

By using transient, 1D, grid-independent numerical solutions, we avoid the use of speculative closure terms and show that the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) is sufficient to model core-annulus regime. That regime arises in the time-average solution as a consequence of the fluctuating motion of regions with high solids concentration. These fluctuations are most sensitive to the gravitational acceleration (g) and granular energy dissipation terms. The fluctuation frequency is \ensuremath{\alpha} \$ \textbackslash sqrt g \$. The effect of fluctuations is so dominant that decreasing the restitution coefficient (KTGF parameter) actually increases the average granular temperature. The wall boundary conditions for solids momentum and granular energy equations dictate the core-annulus flow regime. They must cause a net dissipation of granular energy at the wall for predicting that regime. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007},

  abstract      = {In this study, we are interested in deriving time-smoothed governing and constitutive equations for gas–solids flow in moderately dense systems where particle–particle collision is the main energy dissipation mechanism. Results obtained from dynamic simulations of a gas–solids flow in a 1D channel are used to show that it is possible to obtain expressions for the time-averaged constitutive relations based on Taylor series expansion. We demonstrate, by comparing with time-averaged transient results, that the 1st term (or laminar) in the series expressions of most non-linear constitutive relations can yield inaccurate quantitative and qualitative results. This means that steady-state models derived by simply removing the partial time derivative from the governing equations are not suitable for gas–solids flows. This study shows that it was necessary to include many terms of the Taylor series expression of non-linear constitutive relations (such as the granular energy dissipation term) due to large-scale oscillations that were computed for all flow variables at all locations in the 1D domain. In some cases, the Taylor series expansion diverged and the Euler transformation was used to improve the convergence of these series. In this moderately dense flow system, turbulence in the gas-phase was found to be just a reaction to turbulence in the solids phase that resulted from the large-scale motion of solids clusters. This resulted in a negative turbulent gas viscosity computed due to the fact that gas (in the horizontal direction) flows only to occupy regions vacated by clusters of solids. The steady-state results obtained using the time-smoothed gas–solids flow model compared well with the time-averaged results obtained using the transient model for all flow variables.},

To complement its ongoing research efforts addressing PFAS contamination, the U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) commissioned the PFAS Innovative Treatment Team (PITT) to provide new perspectives on treatment and disposal of high priority PFAS-containing wastes. During its six-month tenure, the team was charged with identifying and developing promising solutions to destroy PFAS. The PITT examined emerging technologies for PFAS waste treatment and selected four technologies for further investigation. These technologies included mechanochemical treatment, electrochemical oxidation, gasification and pyrolysis, and supercritical water oxidation. This paper highlights these four technologies and discusses their prospects and the development needed before potentially becoming available solutions to address PFAS-contaminated waste. Implications: This paper examines four novel, non-combustion technologies or applications for the treatment of persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) wastes. These technologies are introduced to the reader along with their current state of development and areas for further development. This information will be useful for developers, policy makers, and facility managers that are facing increasing issues with disposal of PFAS wastes.},

In such a flow, Doppler signals may be noisy and split, since particles have long residence times in the measurement volume. A novel time average based on the measured burst lengths is proposed to estimate the cross-sectional area of the measurement volume. This time average accounts for the possible split of a noisy Doppler burst, and it provides a more general description of the measurement volume than the conventional ensemble average. The extended post-processing algorithm was tested on experimental time series obtained in a circulating fluidized bed and the algorithm was compared to conventional treatment of the particle data by a commercial PDA processor. The conventional processing strongly overestimates the vertical mass flux integrated over the cross-section. In contrast, time-mean and fluctuations of mass flux, particle volume concentration, and particle velocity are reliably estimated employing the proposed algorithm, with continuity check parameters in succeeding particle data, as well as with a particle velocity filter to estimate the size of the probe volume, applying a two-component PDA in a three-dimensional flow.},

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and process simulation are widely used in the process industry. The two technologies are largely complementary, each being able to capture and analyse some of the important process characteristics. Their combined application can, therefore, lead to significant industrial benefits. This is especially true for systems, such as chemical reactors, in which steady-state performance, dynamics and control strategy depend on mixing and fluid flow behaviour. This paper presents a new approach for the integration of the capabilities of CFD technology and process simulation via a general interface that allows the automatic exchange of critical variables between the two packages, leading to a simultaneous solution of the overall problem. The approach applies to both steady-state and dynamic problems. The feasibility of the approach and its first practical implementation are demonstrated by integrating a widely used CFD package (Fluent 4.5, by Fluent Inc.) within a general-purpose advanced process simulator (gPROMS 1.7, by Process Systems Enterprise Ltd. (1999)). One case study involving a batch reactor is used to illustrate the ability of the combined tool to provide information on the detailed interactions between fluid mechanics, heat transfer, reaction and control strategy, and to provide insights on important design and operational decisions. 0 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The nature of effluent streams varies in terms of its constituents and complexity. The present work attempts to fill the void in the literature that mostly reports synthetic wastewater treatment studies, by evaluating effluent treatment solutions and comparison of different methods for real wastewaters from the fertilizer industry. An attempt has been made to devise suitable methodology mainly using a new device in the form of vortex diode for hydrodynamic cavitation and also using adsorption, for several real wastewater streams from different locations in one major fertilizer industry of Maharashtra, India. The strategy involved characterization of wastewaters, studies on the effective removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and devising solutions for effective reduction in ammoniacal nitrogen--a more serious issue in the fertilizer industry. The characterization of wastewaters from different streams revealed huge variation in COD from 50 to 140,000~ppm and ammoniacal nitrogen from 6 to 1,700~ppm. Some effluent streams contained alcohol up to 5\%. Hydrodynamic cavitation using vortex diode and adsorption with modified carbons were used to treat these streams. Cavitation studies were carried out on a pilot plant and the effect of pressure drop, cavitating device and process intensification were studied. It was observed that the effluent treatment strategy requires careful identification and application of suitable treatment method on the basis of the nature of the effluent. Also, hydrodynamic cavitation, using vortex diode appears to be techno-economically attractive option in treating fertilizer wastewaters giving a very high reduction in COD and ammoniacal nitrogen (up to 85\%), similar to adsorption. The results clearly identify potential of newer methodologies in the treatment of effluents in the fertilizer industry.},

This article presents a comprehensive overview of the process integration aspects for SMR, especially the potential for multiscale modeling in this area. The intensification for SMR is achieved by coupling with adsorption and membrane separation technologies, etc., and using the concept of multifunctional reactors and catalysts to overcome the mass transfer, heat transfer, and thermodynamic limitations.

Gamma ray Computed Tomography (CT) has been used to measure the time-averaged cross-sectional solids holdup distribution. The time-averaged mean and fluctuating solids velocity fields have been quantified using the Computer Automated Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) technique. Details of the experimental techniques, protocol of implementation and data analysis are discussed. The experimental studies examine operating conditions in fast fluidization and dilute phase transport regimes. Comparative and symbiotic analyses of the results obtained from CARPT and CT have been used to develop a coherent picture of the solids flow field. In addition, this work also demonstrates the power of CARPT and CT as flow mapping techniques in studying highly turbulent and opaque multiphase systems.},

For differential pressure fluctuation measurements, a higher U, wgs obtained from the dimensionless standard deviation normalized by the local pressure drop, and the value decreased with iheight. For local voidage fluctuation measurements using an optical fibre probe, a maximum point also appeared in the stbndard deviation curve, although the curve was much flatter than corresponding pressure fluctuation curves.

The amplitude appeared to be less dependent on the measurement location in the dense bed. Predictions based on bubble passage, bubble eruption at the upper bed surface and bed oscillation all failed to explain all observed trends and underestimated the amplitude of pressure fluctuations, suggesting that the global pressure fluctuations in gas-solids bubbling fluidized beds are the superposition of local pressure variations, bed oscillations and pressure waves generated from the bubble formation in the distributor region, bubble coalescence during their rise and bubble eruption at the upper bed surface.},

  abstract      = {Both gas and solids mixing and dispersion in circulating fluidized beds have been studied using steady and unsteady state tracer techniques. Most studies, however, have been conducted in CFB risers with relatively low solids circulation rates. In recent years, the high density and high solids flux CFB riser has received increasing attention due to its applications in catalytic cracking of crude oil and potential applications in catalytic reactions requiring high catalyst-toreactant loading ratios. In view of the significantly different flow structure in high-density and high solid flux risers where annulus solids downward flow is no longer present as revealed in some recent studies, this paper analyzed the similarity and differences of gas and solids mixing behaviour between low density and high density CFB risers based on the data recently collected in our lab and data reported in the literature. It is shown that there exists a clear transition of both gas and solids axial mixing behaviour when the flow structure changes from low density to high density operating conditions, in correspondence to the disappearance of solids downward flow near the wall region. In the low density CFB risers with solids flux lower than \sim{}250 kg/m2s, both gas and solids axial dispersion and backmixing increased with increasing solids flux and solids concentration. Beyond the transition to the dense suspension upflow regime, however, both gas and solids axial dispersions tend to decrease with increasing solids flux, indicating the development of gas and solids flow toward the plug flow resulting from the disappearance of solids downflow in the near wall region. Radial dispersion of gas and solids, on the other hand, showed a continuous decrease over a wide range of solids fluxes within both the low density and high density flow regions, indicating a reduced lateral exchange of gas and particles with increasing solids fluxes.},

The local pressure fluctuations are composed of multiple sources, including local bubble induced fluctuations, global bed oscillations and propagating pressure waves originating in other locations (e.g. bed surface, distributor and windbox). The interaction and coupling among bubble motion, under-damped oscillations of fluidized particles and bed surface, propagating compressible pressure waves and flow pulsation in gas–solid fluidized beds creates the complexity of local pressure fluctuations, and is likely responsible for the formation of complex but unique flow patterns. A few attempts have been reported in the literature on examining the interaction between bed oscillations, plenum chamber air pulsation and propagating pressure waves in fluidized beds, showing some promises on predicting the local pressure fluctuations. Future work should be focused on predicting local and global pressure fluctuations and the formation of unique surface flow patterns by coupling different contributing mechanisms.},

  abstract      = {The mean square of particle velocity fluctuations, \ensuremath{\delta}v2, which is directly related to the so-called granular temperature, plays an important role in the flow, mixing, segregation and attrition phenomena of particulate systems and associated theories. It is, therefore, important to be able to measure this quantity. We report here in detail our use of diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) to measure the mean square particle velocity fluctuations for a 2D non-circulating gas fluidized bed of hollow glass particles whose mean diameter and effective density are 60 \mathrm{\mu}m and 200 kg/m3, respectively. Mean square particle velocity fluctuations were observed to increase with superficial velocity, Us, beyond the minimum fluidization velocity. Following the uniform fluidization theory of Batchelor (1988), the function f (\ensuremath{\varphi}) in the expression \ensuremath{\delta}v2 = f (\ensuremath{\varphi})Us2 was also determined and shown to increase from zero at a solids loading of \ensuremath{\varphi} \approx{} 0.33 to a maximum at \ensuremath{\varphi} \approx{} 0.4 before decreasing again to zero at \ensuremath{\varphi} \approx{} 0.53. The spatial variation of the mean square particle velocity fluctuations was also determined and shown to be approximately symmetrical about the centreline where it is also maximal, and to increase with height above the distributor.},

The first section briefly mentions, in terms of technologies, economy, energy consumption, and costs symmetrically outlined the advantages and disadvantages of various HP routes such as fossil fuel/biomass conversion, water electrolysis, microbial fermentation, and photocatalysis. Subsequently, ANN and ANN hybrid studies implemented in HP research were evaluated. Finally, statistics of hybrid studies with ANN are given, and future research proposals and hot research topics are briefly discussed. This research, which touches upon the types of ANNs applied to HP methods and their comparison with other modeling techniques, has an essential place in its field.},

  abstract      = {A large-eddy-based methodology for the simulation of turbulent sprays is discussed. The transport equations for the spatially filtered gas phase variables, in which source terms accounting for the droplet effects are added, are solved together with a probabilistic description of the liquid phase. The probabilistic approach for the liquid phase is based on the transport equation for the spatially filtered joint probability density function of the variables required in order to describe the state of the liquid phase. In this equation, unclosed terms representing the filtered Lagrangian rates of change of the variables describing the spray are present. General modelling ideas for subgrid-scale (SGS) effects are proposed. The capabilities of the approach and the validity of the closure models, with particular with respect to the SGS dispersion, are investigated through application to a dilute particle-laden turbulent mixing layer. It is demonstrated that the formulation is able to reproduce very closely the measured properties of both the continuous and dispersed phases. The large-eddy simulation (LES) results are also found to be entirely consistent with the experimentally observed characteristics of droplet–gas turbulence interactions. Consistent with direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies of isotropic turbulence laden with particles where the entire turbulence spectrum is found to be modulated by the presence of particles, the present investigation, which comprises the effects of particle transport upon the large-scale vortical structures of a turbulent shear flow, highlights what appears to be a selective behaviour; few large-scale frequencies gain energy whereas the remaining modes are damped.},

The apparent viscosity was measured under dynamic flow conditions and varying shear strain rate using a simple technique of impeller viscometry. From the measurement of impeller speed, impeller and vessel configuration and power input data, a correlation was developed for the apparent viscosity of the non-Newtonian sand–water slurry system employing Reynolds number and power number. The values of apparent viscosity obtained from the above correlation compared reasonably well with the experimental observations by the same authors and also the literature data for a similar slurry system. The technique reported in this paper can be effectively used to measure apparent viscosities of slurries which do not exhibit any flocculating, coagulating or degenerating behaviour under shear within the laminar and transition regime of fluid flow.},

  abstract      = {Separations account for approximately 50\% of all manufacturing costs, making the selection of the proper technology, and a potential affinity separation agent (ASA) of essential importance for process design. This selection is not straightforward. In this paper, aspects of fluid separation technologies, including shortcut calculations to estimate heat duties, are reviewed and applied to create insights in ab initio fluid separation process selection without extensive process simulations. It was found that composition and state of the feed can have major impacts on the minimal required heat duty, as well as the desired product purity. Distillation of dilute feeds is intrinsically hindered by a low internal efficiency and solvent based separations should be considered. Furthermore, the minimal heat duty for liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) with high boiling solvents is primarily feed composition dependent, while for low boiling solvents the solvent to feed ratio is important. This is also the case for the minimal duty for extractive distillation (ED) with light solvents, whereas the minimal duty of ED using high boiling solvents is independent of the composition, and generally higher than the minimal LLX duty. ED can be operated with only two columns, whereas LLX generally requires at least three, leading to higher capital costs. The feed composition dependence of the LLX minimal heat duty can result in a feed compositional break-even point when comparing LLX with ED. Using these theoretical insights in fluid separations, a series of industrial cases was reviewed and critical aspects in technology selection, and solvent selection and design such as selectivity and capacity are discussed. The results confirm the applicability of the minimal heat duty approach as a quick prediction tool for opportunities of solvent based technologies, as well as the need for including other considerations such as the number of required columns (capital costs) and the possibility to recover sensible heat.},

The material is presented in a straightforward manner that is independent of the control system manufacturer. It is assumed that the reader may not have worked in a process plant environment and may be unfamiliar with the field devices and control systems. Much of the material on the practical aspects of control design and process applications is based on the authors personal experience gained in working with process control systems. Thus, the book is written to act as a guide for engineers, managers, technicians, and others that are new to process control or experienced control engineers who are unfamiliar with multi-loop control techniques. After the traditional single-loop and multi-loop techniques that are most often used in industry are covered, a brief introduction to advanced control techniques is provided. Whether the reader of this book is working as a process control engineer, working in a control group or working in an instrument department, the information will set the solid foundation needed to understand and work with existing control systems or to design new control applications. At various points in the chapters on process characterization and control design, the reader has an opportunity to apply what was learned using web-based workshops. The only items required to access these workshops are a high-speed Internet connection and a web browser. Dynamic process simulations are built into the workshops to give the reader a realistic "hands-on" experience. Also, some information is provided on the web site that may be helpful in exploring basic and advanced control techniques. In addition to the online workshops, one chapter of the book is dedicated to techniques that may be used to create process simulations using tools that are commonly available within most distributed control systems. As control techniques are introduced, simple process examples are used to illustrate how these techniques are applied in industry. The last chapter of the book, on process applications, contains several more complex examples from industry that illustrate how basic control techniques may be combined to meet a variety of application requirements},

  abstract      = {In order to model the complex hydrodynamic phenomena prevailing in industrial scale gas–solid bubbling fluidised bed reactors and especially the macro-scale emulsion phase circulation patterns induced by bubble–bubble interactions and bubble coalescence, a discrete bubble model (DBM) has been developed. In the DBM, the (larger) bubbles are modelled as discrete elements and are tracked individually during their rise through the emulsion phase, which is considered as a continuum. The DBM, originally developed for the description of gas–liquid flows, has been adapted to cope with bubbles with a diameter larger than the size of an Eulerian cell, which is required in view of the large bubble size distribution at higher gas flow rates. Moreover, a new drag model for a single bubble rising in a fluidised bed derived from empirical correlations has been implemented, as well as a simple model to account for bubble coalescence and break-up. The strong advantage of the DBM compared to other models previously reported in the literature for the description of large-scale fluidised beds is that it fully accounts for the two-way coupling between the bubbles and the emulsion phase, which enables direct computation of the emulsion phase velocity profiles. Comparison of the results of simulations ignoring bubble coalescence and simulations taking bubble coalescence properly into account demonstrated the significant effect of bubble coalescence on the large-scale circulation patterns prevailing in bubbling fluidised beds. The simulation results for the lateral profiles of the visible bubble flow rate have been compared qualitatively with experimental results reported by Werther [1974. Influence of the bed diameter on the hydrodynamics of gas fluidized beds. A.I.Ch.E. Symposium Series 70(141), 53–62]. The effect of the superficial gas velocity on the velocity and porosity profiles has been studied. In general, it can be concluded that the DBM is able to capture the salient features of the hydrodynamics of bubbling fluidised beds. However, further research is required to improve the closure equations for the bubble behaviour, bubble–bubble interactions and bubble coalescence and break-up to enable a complete quantitative description.},

The equation-oriented IPSEpro environment is used for implementation. The models are based on conservation of mass and energy and allow calculation of the thermodynamic equilibrium with the thermodynamic data of different metal oxide systems implemented. The model assumptions are made in accordance with operating experience from laboratory installations.

It is shown that due to the significantflatteningof the mean gas velocityprofilewith the addition of particles, and the corresponding decreasein turbulent energy production, a generation mechanismmust be present in order to produce gas velocity fluctuation predictions which are consistent with the experimental measurements, even in the case where the experimental results indicate a net suppression of gas phase turbulence in the presence of particles.},

To obtain a better understanding of both reactors, individual hydrodynamic models are developed for a downer and a riser. Both hydrodynamic models incorporate parameters that have not been investigated in depth so far. For example, empirical correlations have been developed to estimate the agglomeration within downers and the slip velocity in risers.},

  abstract      = {In this paper a dynamic simulator of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant, operating in the Chemical Process Engineering Research Institute (CPERI, Thessaloniki, Greece), is presented. The operation of the pilot plant permits the execution of case studies for monitoring of the dynamic responses of the unit, by imposing substantial step changes in a number of the manipulated variables. The comparison between the dynamic behavior of the unit and that predicted by the simulator arise useful conclusions on both the similarities of the pilot plant to commercial units, along with the ability of the simulator to depict the main dynamic characteristics of the integrated system. The simulator predicts the feed conversion, coke yield and heat of catalytic reactions in the FCC riser on the basis of semi-empirical models developed in CPERI and simulates the regenerator according to the two-phase theory of fluidization, with a dilute phase model taking account of postcombustion reactions. The riser and regenerator temperature, the stripper and regenerator pressure drop and the composition of the regenerator flue gas are measured on line and are used for verification of the ability of the simulator to predict the dynamic transients between steady states in both open- and closedloop unit operation. All the available process variables such as the reaction conversion, the coke yield, the carbon on regenerated catalyst and the catalyst circulation rate are used for the validation of the steady-state performance of the simulator. The comparison between the dynamic responses of the model and those of the pilot plant to step changes in the feed rate and preheat temperature reveals the ability of the simulator to accurately depict the complex pilot process dynamics in both open- and closed-loop operation. The dynamic simulator can serve as the basis for the development of a model-based control structure for the pilot plant, alongside its use as a tool for off-line process optimization studies. ᭧ 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our collective input in this report includes numerous recommendations regarding research needs in the field of reaction engineering in the coming decades, including guidance for prioritizing efforts in workforce development, measurement science, and computational methods.

Prior work observed signatures of ultrafast molecular dynamics in both isomers upon ultraviolet excitation but could not follow the electronic relaxation all the way back to the ground state experimentally. Here we study the electronic relaxation of quadricyclane after exciting in the ultraviolet (201\,nanometres) using time-resolved gas-phase extreme ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy combined with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. We identify two competing pathways by which electronically excited quadricyclane molecules relax to the electronic ground state. The fast pathway ({$<$}100\,femtoseconds) is distinguished by effective coupling to valence electronic states, while the slow pathway involves initial motions across Rydberg states and takes several hundred femtoseconds. Both pathways facilitate interconversion between the two isomers, albeit on different timescales, and we predict that the branching ratio of norbornadiene/quadricyclane products immediately after returning to the electronic ground state is approximately 3:2.},

This is due to the fact that the void propagation velocity increases with the square of the porosity for Type B particles and decreases with porosity for Type D particles. A further approximate analysis involving the elastic solids stress between the particles shows the existence of a minimum bubbling velocity and hence provides a rational explanation for the boundary between Type A and B particles.

Some numerical difficulty remains however, especially due to the near-wall layer interactions which seem very difficult to simulate. \'{O} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Steam methane reforming (SMR) is one of the most promising processes for hydrogen production. Several studies have demonstrated its advantages from the economic viewpoint. Nowadays process development is based on technical and economical aspects; however, in the near future, the environmental impact will play a significant role in the design of such processes. In this paper, an SMR process is studied from the viewpoint of overall environmental impact, using an exergoenvironmental analysis. This analysis presents the combination of exergy analysis and life cycle assessment. Components where chemical reactions occur are the most important plant components from the exergoenvironmental point of view, because, in general, there is a high environmental impact associated with these components. This is mainly caused by the exergy destruction within the components, and this in turn is mainly due to the chemical reactions. The obtained results show that the largest potential for reducing the overall environmental impact is associated with the combustion reactor, the steam reformer, the hydrogen separation unit and the major heat exchangers. The environmental impact in these components can mainly be reduced by improving their exergetic efficiency. A sensitivity analysis for some important exergoenvironmental variables is also presented in the paper.},

  abstract      = {It is increasingly more important to be able to predict the conversion and yield of reactant species given the ever rising cost of the reactants and the ever decreasing acceptable level of effluent contaminants. As such, the development and use of predictive models for the reactors is necessary for most processes today. These models all take into account in some manner the relative movement of the gas and of the solid species as well as the interphase mass transfer. The model developer, unless equipped with specific experimentally based empirical correlations for the reactor system under consideration, is required to go to the open literature to obtain correlations for the axial and radial gas dispersion coefficients, the solids axial and radial dispersion coefficients and the interphase mass transfer coefficient between the solid phase and the gas phase. This is a difficult task at present since these values differ by up to 7 orders of magnitude for the mass transfer coefficient and up to 5 orders of magnitude for dispersion coefficients. This paper presents a summary of the work in these areas as found in the literature dating back to 1949 and provides a critical review to guide the selection of the best correlation (s) in circulating fluidized bed reactors. The driver for this paper is the uncertainties due to hydrodynamics that effect conversion in CFBs and as such only reviews the mass transfer coefficient and the gas and solids dispersion coefficients. A comparison of heat transfer coefficients is therefore not included. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These are subsequently used to determine the local solids fractions as a function of radial position in a cold flow circulating fluidized bed (CFCFB) in operation at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Measurements were taken under several separate operating conditions ranging from dilute up-flow to core-annular flow to fast fluidization using nominal 800 micron cork particles. The solids properties and test operating conditions were chosen particularly to provide dynamic similitude between the test data and the operation of a high temperature, high pressure gasifier. The data from these conditions is different in many ways from the data developed using more conventional solids (glass, FCC, and sand) at atmospheric conditions. In this paper, the data from the middle of the riser corresponding to a height of nominally 8 m is presented. Average solids fractions are compared to the apparent values based upon the pressure drop and the near wall measurements are compared to LDV generated solids fraction values, showing good agreement with both. Also, the radial profiles tended to be relatively flat with a sharp rise at the wall.},

Particle velocity measurements were obtained with an LDV system under various operating conditions at locations near the wall to provide data in terms of a time series of particle velocity values. Time scale criteria were developed to characterize the variance of the velocity fluctuations from LDV measurements as either granular temperature or granular turbulent kinetic energy. By applying these criteria to categorize the variations in the velocities for adjacent particles passing the sample volume, the resulting granular temperatures were found to be much smaller than the granular (particle) turbulent kinetic energy. Average values for the granular temperature in this system ranged between 0.02 to 0.1 m2/s2, while the particle turbulent kinetic energy ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 m2/s2. Both were dependent upon solids fraction; decreasing with increasing solids fraction. The velocity fluctuation data was also analyzed using the autocorrelation technique providing axial solids dispersion coefficients. These values range from 0.005 to 0.8 m2/s and were found to be a function of both the gas velocity and solids fraction.

The liquid spray, created by two-phase (gas–liquid) nozzles, forms a jet, i.e. a gas-rich cavity within the fluidized bed. Past studies have shown that good liquid–solid contact requires a large entrainment rate of particles into the jet, followed by intensive mixing of liquid droplets and entrained particles within the jet. The objective of this study is the experimental measurement of solids entrainment into spray jets. The specific application of interest is the enhancement of solids entrainment under conditions relevant to the fluid coking process.},

This in turn enables real-time multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) and indicates the opportunity for automated feedback control. An accelerometer is used to record the vibrational signature generated by a snack food product falling onto a metal surface. The frequency distribution of the acoustic signature is obtained via the discrete Fourier transform. This provides a predictor space from which the textural properties are modeled using partial least-squares (PLS).

Overall, 21 studies with 998 participants were included: 12 using whole lupin, four used lupin protein and five lupin fibre. Beneficial changes were observed in 71\% of studies that measured blood pressure, 83\% measuring satiety and 64\% measuring serum lipids. Unintended weight loss occurred in 25\% of studies. Whole lupin demonstrated more consistent beneficial effects for satiety, glycaemic control and blood pressure than lupin protein or lupin fibre. Heterogeneity, low study numbers and a small participant base indicated further studies are required to strengthen current evidence particularly regarding the protein and dietary fibre components of lupin.},

We emphasise on the proper description of the fluid momentum forces on the valve disc. Three typical valve geometries are considered: a 'reaction-like' geometry with large deflection angle reversing the flow, a simple disc valve with purely radial outlet and a conical geometry, for which the direction of the flow through the valve does not change significantly. It was found that by merely varying the mass fraction of the liquid and the gas, the valve opening time changes drastically, over a range of several orders of magnitude. By using a simplified mechanical analysis and assuming frozen mixture (i.e. fixed mass fraction), a formula was developed providing an order-of-magnitude estimation of the valve opening time.},

Aqueous suspensions of viscose rayon, acrylic, and nylon 6,6 fibers of various fiber concentrations, sizes, and shapes were used. At a fixed shear rate, the apparent viscosity of all the suspensions decreased reversibly with increasing temperature. The steady-state flow behavior is well described by the Bingham fluid model where the yield stress is a decreasing function of temperature and follows an Arrhenius dependence with an activation energy in the range of 2–80\,kJ/mol, which is the same order of magnitude as that reported for 20\,wt.\,\% fibrous biomass suspensions below 55\,\textdegree{}C. The fiber suspensions exhibited a negative plastic viscosity at low temperatures, and as the temperature was increased, the plastic viscosity became less negative. This temperature-dependent rheological behavior is qualitatively similar to that observed for concentrated fibrous biomass suspensions. The fiber suspensions formed heterogeneous networks where the state of aggregation depended on the experimental conditions and thus affected the macroscopic rheology.},

Frosting experiments were performed on a cryogenic cooling surface under forced convection conditions. Subsequently, a model was developed by leveraging both experimental data and a partial differential equation (PDE) representing physical laws. The suggested model was validated using the determination coefficient (R2) and RMSE values. The R2 scores of frost thickness and density were 0.988 and 0.981, with corresponding RMSE values of 0.173 and 2.448, respectively. The model's ability to extrapolate and predict cryogenic frost growth behavior beyond its training range was also evaluated. Despite being trained on only half of the total three-hour experimental duration, the model could predict frost growth behavior in the subsequent periods. Accordingly, it effectively addressed the data imbalance problem between frost thickness and density by concurrently incorporating both data and governing equations.},

The methodology for cluster characterization that is used is based in the determination of four characteristics, related to average life time, average volumetric fraction of solid, existing time fraction and frequency of occurrence. The identification of clusters is performed by applying a criterion related to the time average value of the volumetric solid fraction. A qualitative rather than quantitative analysis is performed mainly owing to the unavailability of operational data used in the considered experiments. Concerning qualitative analysis, the simulation results are in good agreement with literature.

A general semi-empirical correlation based on the Archimedes number which is valid over a range of particle size from 10 to 1000 pm is presented for the prediction of the minimum gas velocity required to pick up particles. Experiments have been carried out with fine particles (glass beads, alumina and coal) in a 52 mm id. transparent pipeline. Noteworthy is the existence of a minimum point in the curves of minimum pickup velocity as a function of particle diameter for particle diameters of approximately 100 Frn. Maximum conveyability is expected to occur at this particle size. Above and below this minimum point, higher gas velocities are required to pick up particles lying on the bottom of a pipe. Experiments in an actual pneumatic conveying system clarify the practical significance and usefulness of the minimum pickup velocity. Thus, it is suggested that the proposed test procedure be used as a unified technique in determining the minimum transport velocity of solid particles in horizontal pneumatic conveying systems.},

Experimental thermal profiles existing along the bed were considered in the model. 3D simulations provide better results than 2D ones and predict silane conversion rate with a mean deviation of 9\% compared to experimental values. The model can predict the temporal and spatial evolutions of local void fractions, gas and particle velocities, species gas fractions and silicon deposition rate. We aim at mid term to model FBCVD treatments of submicronic powders in a vibrated reactor since we have performed experiments proving the efficacy of the process to treat submicronic particles.},

  abstract      = {Fast and accurate airflow simulations in the built environment are critical to provide acceptable thermal comfort and air quality to the occupants. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers detailed analysis on airflow motion, heat transfer, and contaminant transport in indoor environment, as well as wind flow and pollution dispersion around buildings in urban environments. However, CFD still faces many challenges mainly in terms of computational expensiveness and accuracy. With the increasing availability of large amount of data, data driven models are starting to be investigated to either replace, improve, or aid CFD simulations. More specifically, the abilities of deep learning and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as universal non-linear approximator, handling of high dimensionality fields, and computational inexpensiveness are very appealing. In built environment research, deep learning applications to airflow simulations shows the ANN as surrogate, replacement for expensive CFD analysis. Surrogate modeling enables fast or even real-time predictions, but usually at a cost of a degraded accuracy. The objective of this work is to critically review deep learning interactions with fluid mechanics simulations in general, to propose and inform about different techniques other than surrogate modeling for built environment applications. The literature review shows that ANNs can enhance the turbulence model in various way for coupled CFD simulations of higher accuracy, improve the efficiency of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) methods, leverage crucial physical properties and information with physics informed deep learning modeling, and even unlock new advanced methods for flow analysis such as super-resolution techniques. These promising methods are largely yet to be explored in the built environment scene. Unavoidably, deep learning models also presents challenges such as the availability of consistent large flow databases, the extrapolation task problem, and over-fitting, etc.},

EoS Simulator can estimate two-phase envelopes, isobars, isotherms, and surfaces related to PTVHS properties. MATLAB Grader courses were proposed to test student learning using the software in two different workshops. The evaluation was based on the achievement of tasks related to intended learning outcomes.

It starts with a discussion of the basic transport mechanisms in a granular flow. It continues with a discussion of contact mechanics – the way that individual particles see each other mechanically. It then discusses the historical limiting regimes of granular flow, the Quasistatic and the Rapid-Flow regimes. Finally, it concludes with a review of the Elastic picture of granular flow, which both unifies the Quasistatic and Rapid regimes and fills in the intervening space. It shows that the rheological behavior of granular systems changes with system scale constraints, and, in particular, that the materials behave differently under controlled-stress and controlled-concentration conditions. The Elastic model defines an entire flowmap of granular flow and thus allows one to place boundaries on where the Quasistatic and Rapid-Flow models (sometimes called kinetic theory models) are something of a red herring and cannot be applied to common granular flows.},

A thermodynamically consistent turbulent two-phase flow model that accounts for the phase fluctuation energy transport and interaction is used. The governing equation of the gas-phase is upgraded to a two-equation low Reynolds number turbulence closure model that can be integrated directly to the wall. A no-slip boundary condition for the gas-phase and slip-boundary condition for the particulate phase are used. The computational model is first applied to dilute gas-particle turbulent flow between two parallel vertical walls. The predicted mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles are compared with the experimental data of Tsuji et al. (1984) for vertical pipe flows, and good agreement is observed. Examples of additional flow properties such as the phasic fluctuation energy, phasic fluctuation energy production and dissipation, as well as interaction momentum and energy supply terms are also presented and discussed. Applications to the relatively dense gas-particle turbulent flows in a vertical channel are also studied. The model predictions are compared with the experimental data of Miller \& Gidaspow and reasonable agreement is observed. It is shown that flow behavior is strongly affected by the phasic fluctuation energy, and the momentum and energy transfer between the particulate and the fluid constituents.},

With styrene resin (dp = 1.45 mm, s = 1264 kg/m3) as solid phases, air as gas phase, and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium as liquid phase, local phase hold-ups are measured simultaneously by micro-conductivity probe technique under a wide range of operation conditions. Liquid flow velocity measurements have been performed using the electrolyte tracer measurement (ETM) technique. Measurement results in a GLSCFB riser presented here give an insight into the distribution laws of the local phase hold-ups and liquid velocity in radial directions. A closed Eulerian/Eulerian/Lagrangian model (E/E/L model) for simulating gas–liquid–solid three-phase local flow properties was developed by combining Two Fluid Model (TFM) and District Element Method (DEM). This model was based on the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. The motion of particles was described in the Lagrangian co-ordinates, while the gas phase and the liquid phase were described within the Eulerian co-ordinates. Based on IPSA and PSIC solution techniques, the program of simulating gas–liquid–solid local flow properties was achieved. The numerical simulating results of local phase hold-ups and local radial liquid velocity agreed well with the experimental data in a GLSCFB riser, and the applicability and reliability of this model were validated.},

  abstract      = {In the recent decade, hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) emerged as a promising and effective homogenization technique for preparing oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion. This technique has presented several advantages: size reduction to the nanoscale, long-term kinetic stability, and high energy efficiency. However, in the reported literature, the physical and chemical stability has not been considered to define the quality of the prepared emulsions using HC. Therefore, it is now essential to understand the effect of several geometrical and operating parameters of HC on the physical and chemical stabilities of the prepared emulsions to cover their broader applications. This review attempts to answer this question through a critical analysis of previously reported work. This review gives an overview of the mechanism of cavitationally assisted emulsification, disruptive forces involved in the emulsification process, operating parameters affecting the emulsion stability, and the current research in this area. This review elucidates the possible HC-induced lipid degradation pathway during emulsification which has been overlooked so far. The possible mechanisms and operating conditions affecting the lipid oxidation during HC-assisted emulsification are presented. Some effective strategies and recommendations for obtaining the optimum operating parameters are presented. Future perspectives and directions for further investigations in this area are also discussed.},

By the axial solids concentration distribution, it was verified that (1) the curve that precedes the entrance into the riser provides further acceleration to the flow and (2) the abrupt exit causes an increase in solids concentration in the top zone. Results of radial distributions in the bottom zone show that the flow is more concentrated near the wall. For the exit zone, the distributions show high values of solids holdup both near the wall and on the axis.},

Ideally, such technologies may preserve the original properties of the food products while reaching their primary target of application. Scope and approach At this point, hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) is recognized as one of the potential technologies for food processing since it provides effective conditions to activate and accelerate desired physiochemical transformations of treated medium. Cavitation phenomenon has been interestingly applied in the treatments and processing of foods towards homogenization (high pressure homogenizers, HPH)/mixing of systems, pasteurization/sterilization, degradation of target molecules, among other purposes. Therefore, this review aims to release the progress in applying HC-assisted technologies for the processing of food, beverages and other food items. Key findings and conclusion Apart from microorganism inactivation mechanisms in pasteurization and sterilization for foods, emulsion formation in food systems, extraction of bioactive compounds, and improvement of physicochemical properties of food systems are reviewed. Here, the advantages and drawbacks of HC compared to other technologies are also addressed and discussed. To finalize, according to the findings of this review, the future trends, perspectives, and research gaps are also given.},

Utilizing activated carbon particles as catalysts enhances methane conversion rates and helps reduce pyrolysis temperatures while avoiding the high costs and metal contamination risks associated with metal catalysts. This study presents a model for the decomposition of methane over carbon catalysts using a comprehensive kinetic approach. The model includes heterogeneous surface reactions for methane dissociation and carbon depositions. It also introduces a novel method that utilizes the relationship between pore structure and specific surface area to explain the long-term deactivation process of the particles. The results demonstrate good agreement with various deactivation experiments, showing how methane conversion rates decrease as the specific surface area of the particles decreases during the pyrolysis process. Importantly, the simulations confirm the catalytic role of these particles in the pyrolysis process and how their presence in the reactor fundamentally alters the dynamics of the process compared to an empty reactor. The proposed model takes into account the catalytic effects of activated carbon while addressing the challenges posed by its complex pore structures. The findings offer insights into optimizing catalytic methane pyrolysis, providing a pathway to more efficient hydrogen production while harnessing valuable solid carbon by-products.},

A comprehensive model is developed in the present work in which a two-equation (k–\varepsilon{}) turbulence model is used for calculating the gas phase. In addition, a transport equation of particle phase turbulent kinetic energy is proposed and used for modeling the particle phase turbulence (kp model). Similar to that of the single gas phase, effective viscosity of the particle phase is the sum of the laminar viscosity caused by particle–particle collisions described by kinetic theory and the turbulent viscosity caused by collections of particles described by the kp model.

  abstract      = {Hydrogen (H2) is a promising renewable energy which finds wide applications as the world gears toward low-carbon economy. However, current H2 production via steam methane reforming of natural gas or gasification of coal are laden with high CO2 footprints. Recently, methane (CH4) pyrolysis has emerged as a potential technology to generate low-carbon H2 and solid carbon. In this review, the current state-of-art and recent progress of H2 production from CH4 pyrolysis are reviewed in detail. Aspects such as fundamental mechanism and chemistry involved, effect of process parameters on the conversion efficiency and reaction kinetics for various reaction media and catalysts are elucidated and critically discussed. Temperature, among other factors, plays the most critical influence on the methane pyrolysis reaction. Molten metal/salt could lower the operating temperature of methane pyrolysis to {$<$} 1000\textdegree{}C, whereas plasma technology usually operates in the regime of {\$>\$} 1000\textdegree{}C. Based on the reaction kinetics, metal-based catalysts were more efficient in lowering the activation energy of the reaction to 29.5-88 kJ/mol from that of uncatalyzed reaction (147-420.7 kJ/mol). Besides, the current techno-economic performance of the process reveals that the levelized cost of H2 is directly influenced by the sales price of carbon (by-product) generated, which could offset the overall cost. Lastly, the main challenges of reactor design for efficient product separation and retrieval, as well as catalyst deactivation/poisoning need to be debottlenecked.},

The onset of choking with plastic and steel powders is well predicted by the correlation of Yang [Powder TechnoZ., 35 (1983) 1431.

  abstract      = {The large-scale implementation of renewable energy systems necessitates the development of energy storage solutions to effectively manage imbalances between energy supply and demand. Herein, we investigate such a scalable material solution for energy storage in supercapacitors constructed from readily available material precursors that can be locally sourced from virtually anywhere on the planet, namely cement, water, and carbon black. We characterize our carbon-cement electrodes by combining correlative EDS–Raman spectroscopy with capacitance measurements derived from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments using integer and fractional derivatives to correct for rate and current intensity effects. Texture analysis reveals that the hydration reactions of cement in the presence of carbon generate a fractal-like electron-conducting carbon network that permeates the load-bearing cement-based matrix. The energy storage capacity of this space-filling carbon black network of the high specific surface area accessible to charge storage is shown to be an intensive quantity, whereas the high-rate capability of the carbon-cement electrodes exhibits self-similarity due to the hydration porosity available for charge transport. This intensive and self-similar nature of energy storage and rate capability represents an opportunity for mass scaling from electrode to structural scales. The availability, versatility, and scalability of these carbon-cement supercapacitors opens a horizon for the design of multifunctional structures that leverage high energy storage capacity, high-rate charge/discharge capabilities, and structural strength for sustainable residential and industrial applications ranging from energy autarkic shelters and self-charging roads for electric vehicles, to intermittent energy storage for wind turbines and tidal power stations.},

  abstract      = {Microalgae are the main source of third-generation biofuels because they have a lipid content of 20–70\%, can be abundantly produced and do not compete in the food market besides other benefits. Biofuel production from microalgae is a promising option to contribute for the resolution of the eminent crisis of fossil energy and environmental pollution specially in the transporting sector. The choice of lipid extraction method is of relevance and associated to the algae morphology (i.e., rigid cells). Therefore, it is essential to develop suitable extraction technologies for economically viable and environment-friendly lipid recovery processes with the aim of achieving a commercial production of biofuels from this biomass. This review presents an exhaustive analysis and discussion of different methods and processes of lipid extraction from microalgae for the subsequent conversion to biodiesel. Physical methods based on the use of supercritical fluids, ultrasound and microwaves were reviewed. Chemical methods using solvents with different polarities, aside from mechanical techniques such as mechanical pressure and enzymatic methods, were also analyzed. The advantages, drawbacks, challenges and future prospects of lipid extraction methods from microalgae have been summarized to provide a wide panorama of this relevant topic for the production of economic and sustainable energy worldwide.},

  abstract      = {The coupling of steam reforming and oxidative reforming of methane for the e cient production of hydrogen is investigated over Ni=Al2O3 catalyst in a novel circulating fast uidized-bed membrane reformer (CFFBMR) using a rigorous mathematical model. The removal of product hydrogen using palladium hydrogen membranes ``breaks'' the thermodynamic equilibrium barrier exists among the reversible reactions. Oxygen can be introduced into the adiabatic CFFBMR for oxidative reforming by direct oxygen (or air) feed and through dense perovskite oxygen membranes. The simulations show that high productivity of hydrogen can be obtained in the CFFBMR. The combination of these two di erent processes does not only enhance the hydrogen productivity but also save the energy due to the exothermicity of the oxidative reforming. Based on the preliminary investigations, four parameters (number of hydrogen membranes, number of oxygen membranes, direct oxygen feed rate and steam-to-carbon feed ratio) are carefully chosen as main variables for the process optimization. The optimized result shows that the hydrogen productivity (moles of hydrogen produced per hour per m3 of reactor) in the novel CFFBMR is about 8.2 times higher than that in typical industrial \"{y}xed-bed steam reformers.},

It is assumed that two factors mainly contribute to the pressure drop, i.e., the local loss and the loss along the distance. The former includes the expansion loss at the cyclone inlet and the contraction loss at the entrance of the outlet tube (or vortex finder). The latter consists of the swirling loss resulting from friction at the cyclone walls and the dissipation of gas dynamic energy in the outlet tube. By use of the measured results of the flow field in cyclones, the calculation methods for each loss have been developed. And a universal model to predict the cyclone pressure drop is thus obtained simply by summing each loss. A detailed comparison between the calculated and experimental results shows that this accurate model is suitable either for pure or for dust laden gases at normal or high temperatures and can meet the requirement of most cyclone designs.},

  abstract      = {The introduction of secondary air (SA) in fluidized bed boilers is of important engineering significance. In the present work, an experimental study on the characteristics of SA penetration is carried out by operating a bubbling fluidized bed model. Floater, the ash formed from coal combustion, is used as experimental bed material. It has an average size of 0.83 mm and a low density of 620 kg/m3. Results indicate that the floater is more suitable to be operated in a spouted or a bubbling bed. Comparing with the conventional sand and FCC, the fluidizing characteristics of the floater are similar to those of Geldart Group D particles. From measurements of the solid concentration in the bed cross section at SA injection level by use of a solid concentration measuring thief probe of own design, the relation between SA jetting distance and SA velocity under different solid concentrations is obtained when the properties of bed material and SA ports are fixed. Furthermore, a dimensionless correlation is proposed for general cases. The results may provide a basis for further study.},

  abstract      = {Natural cavitation is defined as the formation of vapor bubbles in a flow due to the pressure falling below the liquid's vapor pressure. The inception of the cavitation bubble is influenced by a lot of aspects, such as impurities, turbulence, liquid thermal properties, etc. In this paper, the exact difference method (EDM) and the Carnahan–Starling real-gas equation of state (EOS) are coupled in the Shan–Chen multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, which is validated as being suitable for simulating high liquid/vapor density ratio multiphase flows. The 2D cavitation ``bubble'' growth is simulated under a quiescent and shear flow in the inception stage. Besides yielding the large density ratio, the real-gas EOS also leads to apparently different compressibilities for liquid and vapor. The results agree with Rayleigh–Plesset predictions much better than those of a previous publication [X. Chen, Simulation of 2D cavitation bubble growth under shear flow by lattice Boltzmann model, Communications in Computational Physics 7 (2010) 212–223]. In the meantime, a comparison is conducted for single-bubble behavior under different shear rates, with reduced temperature T/Tcritical=0.6891 and relaxation time \ensuremath{\tau}=1.0. The simulation results show that the cavitation bubble deformation is consistent with the bubble dynamics, D\propto{}Ca, where D and Ca are the bubble deformation and the capillary number respectively. The shear rate hardly influences the bubble growth rate.},

  abstract      = {A reduced basis method based on a physics-informed machine learning framework is developed for efficient reduced-order modeling of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs). A feedforward neural network is used to approximate the mapping from the time-parameter to the reduced coefficients. During the offline stage, the network is trained by minimizing the weighted sum of the residual loss of the reduced-order equations, and the data loss of the labeled reduced coefficients that are obtained via the projection of high-fidelity snapshots onto the reduced space. Such a network is referred to as physics-reinforced neural network (PRNN). As the number of residual points in time-parameter space can be very large, an accurate network – referred to as physics-informed neural network (PINN) – can be trained by minimizing only the residual loss. However, for complex nonlinear problems, the solution of the reduced-order equation is less accurate than the projection of high-fidelity solution onto the reduced space. Therefore, the PRNN trained with the snapshot data is expected to have higher accuracy than the PINN. Numerical results demonstrate that the PRNN is more accurate than the PINN and a purely data-driven neural network for complex problems. During the reduced basis refinement, the PRNN may obtain higher accuracy than the direct reduced-order model based on a Galerkin projection. The online evaluation of PINN/PRNN is orders of magnitude faster than that of the Galerkin reduced-order model.},

In this paper, a converging and a de Laval nozzle fabricated by additive manufacturing using ABS filament are designed and tested. Surface roughness inside the converging nozzle is quantified using a nondestructive method. In general, the experimental results compare well with the analytical solutions from isentropic equations for the converging nozzle and the numerical simulations conducted in ANASYS Fluent for the de Laval nozzle. 3D-printed nozzles can be employed to quickly demonstrate and verify novel ideas and concepts in the pedagogy and research at large Reynolds numbers.},

This article reports the development of a novel microfluidic electrochemical biosensing platform to address this challenge. The electrochemical sensing is achieved by utilizing a micropillar array electrode (\ensuremath{\mu}AE) coated with 3D bimetallic Pt–Pd nanotrees to enhance the sensitivity. A bubble-based acoustic microstreaming technique is integrated with the device to increase the contact of analyte molecules with the surface of electrodes to further enhance the electrochemical performance. The current density of Pt–Pd NTs/\ensuremath{\mu}AE with acoustic microstreaming is nearly 22 times that of the bare planar electrode in potassium ferrocyanide solution. The developed biosensor has demonstrated excellent sensing performance. For hydrogen peroxide detection, both the Pt–Pd NTs/\ensuremath{\mu}AE and acoustic microstreaming contribute to the sensitivity enhancement. The current density of the Pt–Pd NTs/\ensuremath{\mu}AE is approximatively 28 times that of the bare \ensuremath{\mu}AE. With acoustic microstreaming, this enhancement is further increased by nearly 1.6 times. The platform has a linear detection range of 5–1000~\ensuremath{\mu}M with a LOD of 1.8~\ensuremath{\mu}M toward hydrogen peroxide detection, while for sarcosine detection, the linear range is between 5 and 100~\ensuremath{\mu}M and LOD is 2.2~\ensuremath{\mu}M, respectively. Furthermore, the sarcosine biosensing shows a high sensitivity of 667~\ensuremath{\mu}A~mM-1\bullet{}cm-2. Such a sensing platform has the potential as a portable device for high sensitivity detection of biomarkers.},

In this work, we propose TGM-Nets, a deep learning framework that combines bioimaging and tumor growth modeling (TGM) for enhanced prediction of tumor growth. This proposed framework, developed based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), is capable of integrating the TGM and sequential observations of tumor morphology for patient-specific prediction of tumor growth. The novelties of the design of TGM-Nets include the employment of Fourier layers to extract the features of the input images as well as the utilization of sequential learning and fine-tuning with physics for extrapolation to improve the prediction accuracy. The validity of TGM-Nets for tumor growth forecasting is verified by testing the model performance on synthetic and in-vitro datasets, respectively. Our results show that the TGM-Nets not only can track the growth rates of the mild and aggressive tumors but also capture their detailed morphological features within and outside the training domain. In particular, TGM-Nets can be used to predict the long time dynamics of tumor growth in mild and aggressive cases. Our results show that the parameters inferred from the TGM-Nets can be used for long-time prediction for up to 4 months with a maximum error of \sim{} 4\%. We also systematically study the effects of the number of training points and noisy data on the performance of TGM-Nets as well as quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions. We show that TGM-Nets can integrate the biomedical images to predict the growth of the in-vitro cultured pancreatic cancer cells and identify the associated growth rates, demonstrating the possibilities of using TGM-Nets in clinical practice. In summary, we propose a new deep learning model that combines imaging and TGM to improve the current approaches for predicting tumor growth and thus provide an advanced computational tool for patient-specific tumor prognosis.},

While QA datasets are plentiful in areas like general domain and biomedicine, academic chemistry is less explored. Chemical QA plays a crucial role in both education and research by effectively translating complex chemical information into readily understandable format. Addressing this gap, we introduce ScholarChemQA, a large-scale QA dataset constructed from chemical papers. This dataset reflects typical real-world challenges, including an imbalanced data distribution and a substantial amount of unlabeled data that can be potentially useful. Correspondingly, we introduce a QAMatch model, specifically designed to effectively answer chemical questions by fully leveraging our collected data. We first address the issue of imbalanced label distribution by re-weighting the instance-wise loss based on the inverse frequency of each class, ensuring minority classes are not dominated by majority ones during optimization. Next, we utilize the unlabeled data to enrich the learning process, generating a variety of augmentations based on a SoftMix operation and ensuring their predictions align with the same target, i.e., pseudo-labels. To ensure the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose a calibration procedure aimed at closely aligning the pseudo-label estimates of individual samples with a desired ground truth distribution. Experiments show that our QAMatch significantly outperforms the recent similar-scale baselines and Large Language Models (LLMs) not only on our ScholarChemQA dataset but also on four benchmark datasets. We hope our benchmark and model can facilitate and promote more research on chemical QA.},

The main ingredients of PC-PINNs include: 1) an NTK-based adaptive weighting strategy to balance the multiple loss terms arising from coupled equations, 2) a generalized adaptive sampling scheme complemented by dual criteria to accurately track the corrosion interface, 3) a random-batch technique to accelerate the weight calculation, and 4) a cross-scale sampling technique to ensure the veracity of convergence.

Downer is therefore acknowledged as a novel multiphase flow reactor with great potential in high-severity operated processes, such as the high temperature, ultra-short contact time reactions with the intermediates as the desired products. Typical process developments in industry have directed to (1) the new-generation refinery process for cracking of heavier feedstock to gasoline and light olefins (e.g., propylene) as by-products; and (2) coal pyrolysis in hydrogen plasma which opens up a direct means for producing acetylene, i.e., a new route to synthesize chemicals from a clean coal utilization process. This paper is to give a comprehensive review on the development of fundamental researches on downer reactors as well as the particular industrial demonstrations for the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy oils and coal pyrolysis in thermal plasma.},

  abstract      = {Plastics that can metabolize in oceans are highly sought for a sustainable future. In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.}

To exploit the benefits of fluidized beds for the time-critical sustainability challenges, scale-up has to be implemented quicker and better. Correspondingly, a companion Part 1 ( Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2024, 63, 2519-2533) reviewed the evolution of the tools used in scaling up fluidized beds. Leveraging that, the current Part 2 aims to first overview the traditional pathway for scale-up and then propose a new pathway. Notably, instead of the traditional way of focusing on a linear sequence of progressively larger units, the emphasis is on the Phases of Discovery, Research, and Development, which apply the new tools consistently, as well as address risk mitigation and economics throughout. Based on an acrylonitrile case study, a Monte Carlo analysis indicates the new proposed pathway offers more promising economic feasibility, with net present value over 20 years (NPV20) of \$310MM higher, along with 35\% and 42\% reductions in start-up and break-even times, respectively. The increase in costs for incorporating modeling efforts is insignificant compared to the overall benefits with respect to time and economics.},

An interesting acoustical signal is observed when a satellite drop hits a previously formed cavity, creating an oscillating air body which shows great symmetry about the time axis; its envelope is similar to analytical polar-cardioid or `heart' function. The heart signals reach a maximum value when four cycles are completed and then are exponentially damped. The other features of the heart signal are a total duration of \approx{}20–24~ms and frequencies between 1.7 and 1.8~kHz. Finally, when the cavity-eccentricity is calculated, two regions are observed, corresponding to the presence or absence of the secondary bubble entrainment.},

Therefore, technologies need adaptations to ensure a more sustainable future for medicine. Such technological improvements could be designed by taking inspiration from nature, where the concept of ``waste'' is virtually non-existent. These nature-inspired solutions can be engineered into the lifecycle of medical materials at different points, from raw materials and fabrication to application and recycling. To achieve this, we present four technological developments as promising enablers – surface patterning, additive manufacturing, microfluidics, and synthetic biology. For each enabler, we discuss how sustainable solutions can be designed based on current understanding of, and ongoing research on, natural systems or concepts, including shark skin, decentralised manufacturing, process intensification, and synthetic biology.},

  abstract      = {This research designed and developed an ultrasonic reactor for a fast and on demand production of cold brew coffee, remarkably reducing the brewing time from 24~h to less than 3~min. The technology was engineered by utilizing resonance to induce ultrasonic waves around the walls of the brewing basket of an espresso machine. The sound transmission system comprised a transducer, a horn and a brewing basket. This arrangement transformed the coffee basket into an effective sonoreactor that injected sound waves at multiple points through its walls, thereby generating multiple regions for acoustic cavitation within the reactor. Furthermore, acoustic streaming induced greater mixing and enhanced mass transfer during brewing. The design was accomplished by modeling the transmission of sound, and acoustic cavitation. Brew characterization and chemical composition analysis was performed, considering factors such as pH, acidity, color, and the composition of caffeine, fatty acids, and volatiles. The efficiency of the extraction increased by decreasing the basket loading percentage (BLP). For instance, sonicating at 100~W doubled the extraction yield and caffeine concentration, from 15.05~\% to 33.44~\% at BLP~=~33~\%, and from 0.91~mg/mL to 1.84~mg/mL at BLP~=~67~\%, respectively. The total fatty acids increased from 1.16~mg/mL to 9.20~mg/mL, representing an eightfold increase, at BLP~=~33~\%. Finally, a sensory analysis was conducted to evaluate appearance, aroma, texture, flavor, and aftertaste, which demonstrated that coffee brewed for 1 and 3~min in the sonoreactor exhibited almost undistinguishable properties compared to a standard 24~h brewing without ultrasound.},

  abstract      = {For combustion with CO2 capture, chemical-looping combustion (CLC) with inherent separation of CO2 is a promising technology. Two interconnected fluidized beds are used as reactors. In the fuel reactor, a gaseous fuel is oxidized by an oxygen carrier, e.g. metal oxide particles, producing carbon dioxide and water. The reduced oxygen carrier is then transported to the air reactor, where it is oxidized with air back to its original form before it is returned to the fuel reactor. The feasibility of using oxygen carrier based on oxides of iron, nickel, copper and manganese was investigated. Oxygen carrier particles were produced by freeze granulation. They were sintered at 1300 8C for 4 h and sieved to a size range of 125– 180 mm. The reactivity of the oxygen carriers was evaluated in a laboratory fluidized bed reactor, simulating a CLC system by exposing the sample to alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions at 950 8C for all carriers except copper, which was tested at 850 8C. Oxygen carriers based on nickel, copper and iron showed high reactivity, enough to be feasible for a suggested CLC system. However, copper oxide particles agglomerated and may not be suitable as an oxygen carrier. Samples of the iron oxide with aluminium oxide showed signs of agglomeration. Nickel oxide showed the highest reduction rate, but displayed limited strength. The reactivity indicates a needed bed mass in the fuel reactor of about 80 –330 kg/MWth and a needed recirculation flow of oxygen carrier of 4 – 8 kg/s, MWth.},

  abstract      = {A new generation FCC process model has been developed that describes fundamental cracking chemistry of FCC feedstocks using over 3000 molecular species. FCC reaction chemistry is speci"ed using the methods of structure-oriented-lumping (SOL) with over 60 reaction rules. Application of these rules results in a complex network of over 30,000 elementary chemical reactions. Both monomolecular reactions such as cracking, isomerization, and cyclization and bimolecular reactions such as hydrogen transfer, coking, and disproportionation are included. The e!ects of thermal cracking and metals-catalyzed dehydrogenation are also represented. Reactivity relationships have been developed to reduce the number of parameters required to specify the kinetic model. The kinetic parameters are regressed from data spanning a wide range of FCC process conditions, feed compositions, and catalyst formulations. The riser kinetic model is coupled with equipment models for key FCC components to form an integrated FCC process model. The model accurately predicts product yields, product composition, and product quality over a wide range of FCC process conditions and is capable of predicting the complex non-linear phenomena exhibited in commercial FCC operations such as steady-state multiplicity. The model can be used to predict the quality of FCC products made from di!erent crudes as well as to scope novel processing schemes for improving FCC product quality. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In order to gain insight into the distribution of the gas between the phases and the mechanisms behind these effects simulations of small bubbling fluidized beds with one or two secondary gas injection points were carried out using a discrete particle model. Although the systems are very small, so that wall effects cannot be excluded, the model predicts that the bubble size and bubble fraction both decrease with secondary gas injection, while the gas flow through the dense phase increases. The secondary gas tends to stay in the dense phase, which limits the amount of gas available to form bubbles and is the main contributor to the decrease in the bubble size and fraction. The gas–solid contact improves as a result.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a numerical study of particle–fluid flow in complex three-dimensional (3D) systems by means of Combined Continuum and Discrete Method (CCDM). In the CCDM, the motion of discrete particles phase is obtained by Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle and the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navier–Stokes equations that can be solved by the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This method has been increasingly used worldwide, but so far its application is limited to relatively simple flow systems. In this work, the simulation is achieved by incorporating a DEM code into the commercial CFD software package Fluent that can be readily used for complex CFD problems. The applicability of this development is demonstrated in the study of the particle–fluid flow in various 3D systems including pneumatic conveying bend, cyclone separator and circulating fluidized bed. It is shown that the numerical results are, either qualitatively or quantitatively depending on the availability of experimental data for comparison, in good agreement with those measured, and can generate information leading to better understanding of the internal flow structure of these systems. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Lupins are underutilized legumes and are particularly attractive to the food industry because they have high protein and fiber contents in addition to a low starch content. Unlike, most other legumes, lupin contains oil. Despite the proven nutritional and functional benefits, lupins are primarily used as animal feed and do not yet play an important role in human nutrition. For the lupin seeds to become a major player in the food industry, important information on the extraction and purification of proteins and how protein isolates can be exploited in different food formulations is required. This review discusses the underlying principles for dry and wet fractionation of lupin seeds and the influence on yield and techno-functional properties of resultant protein-enriched products. The physicochemical, nutritional, functional, and health benefits of lupin protein isolate, incorporation into different food formulations, and patents on lupin protein technologies were also discussed. This review is timely regarding advancing lupin seed protein research and applications as a sustainable, plant-based protein source for human diets.},

  abstract      = {The scaling up of fluidized beds has been purposefully pursued for more than 100 years. Yet, over that time, scale-up tools have not significantly changed. Data analysis is typically a standard analysis of variances statistical exercise, perhaps reinforced with a design of experimental procedure. Flowsheeting and equipment design are based on institutional knowledge, albeit graphical user interface-based process flow models make that job more manageable. Advanced models such as computational fluid dynamics are used but often as a supplement and not a primary driver. As a result, the scale-up process for a fluidized bed can take more than 10 years. Fluidized beds remain at the forefront of the present time-critical sustainability challenges, e.g., carbon capture by particulate sorbents, methane-to-hydrogen, plastic-to-chemicals, etc. In view of the exigency toward net zero, today's scale-up efforts need to be accelerated, leveraging the advanced new tools that have become readily available. The problem is that such tools are often neglected, inadequately implemented, ineffectively resourced, and/or poorly understood. This motivated the current effort, which is targeted at reviewing how scale-up tools have evolved over the years and the promising new tools, addressing some of the barriers of these tools in the design and scale-up of fluidized beds, as well as contemplating what can be done to circumvent these barriers. As a follow up, a companion part 2 (Cocco, R. A.; Chew, J. W. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., submitted for publication) proposes a new scale-up path leveraging the advanced tools to achieve timely implementation of the new green fluidized bed processes.},

Fluid coking, a thermal cracking process utilizing a fluidized bed of hot particles, processes approximately 1 million barrels of residual oil daily. This study aims to understand the formation and breakage of wet agglomerates in fluidized beds, which are known to impact the efficiency of thermal cracking by promoting coke formation and fouling. A model is proposed to predict wet agglomerate formation, drying, and breakage. Experiments in a scaled-down cold model of the reactor provided data to validate the model. The study investigated the effects of spray nozzle penetration and the addition of a baffle on agglomerate behaviour. Results indicate that increased nozzle penetration reduces wet agglomerate formation, and adding a baffle increases agglomerate drying time and promotes breakage, reducing the amount of liquid reaching the reactor outlet. The combined approach of optimizing nozzle penetration and adding a baffle significantly improves fluid coker operation by minimizing the detrimental impact of wet agglomerates.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we introduce and validate a novel non-intrusive probe of the average kinetic energy, or granular temperature, of the particles at the wall of a gas fluidized bed. We present data on the granular temperature of monodispersed glass spheres which span region B, and extend into region A, of the Geldart powder classification. The underlying physics of the measurement is the acoustic shot noise excitation of the surface of the fluid bed vessel by random particle impact. Quantitative determination of the average particle granular temperature is obtained through independent measurement of the wall transfer function determining the coupling between the acoustic shot noise excitation at one location and the response of an accelerometer at another location. We validate the concept and calibration of this acoustic shot noise probe in the frequency range 10–20 kHz, through a comprehensive series of laboratory measurements with gasses and cylinders of significantly different acoustic properties. We demonstrate its utility by presenting the first data on the dependence of the granular temperature on gas flow and particle diameter and make the first observation of a change in the character of the fluidization transition from first order (hysteretic and discontinuous) to second order (reversible and continuous) for Geldart B glass spheres as the A/B boundary is approached. We observe a striking difference in the dependence of the granular temperature on gas flow between Geldart B and A glass spheres, that suggests a fundamental difference in particle dynamics between spheres in the two Geldart regimes. Finally we use the vibrational probe to study the time dependence of the granular temperature under bed collapse conditions when fluidizing gas is withdrawn rapidly from the system. We show an exponential time dependence with a time constant of the order of 100 ms, and demonstrate the consistency of this result with a Langevin equation for the sphere velocity with a time constant derived from the sphere fluctuation velocity and a collisional coefficient of restitution of 0.9. From these results for the granular temperature and a kinetic model for a dense granular gas, we present estimates for the inertial pressure, velocity of sound, viscosity, and diffusion constant of the dense phase of a gas fluidized bed as a function of particle diameter and gas superficial velocity. The implication of these results for current models of gas fluidized beds, and the fundamental basis of the Geldart classification is discussed.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we present new experimental data on the steady-state, mean squared, fluctuation velocity, or granular temperature, of Geldart B polymer, glass, nickel, and stainless steel monodispersed spheres averaged over the wall of a gas fluidized bed, as a function of gas flow and sphere diameter. The granular temperature is obtained by Acoustic Shot Noise technology--namely power spectral analysis of the steady state vibrational energy of the wall excited by random sphere impact, and calibrated by hammer excitation over the wall. The new data extends to polymer and metallic spheres the experimental discovery of a 1996 paper of Cody et al. that the fluctuation velocity of Geldart B glass spheres when scaled to the gas superficial velocity, Us, is inversely proportional to sphere diameter, directly proportional to a fundamental length scale, DoB, and is a universal function of U = (Us / Umf). We also demonstrate that the new data is consistent with the diameter dependence of the fluctuation velocity that can be derived from both the 1997 paper of Menon and Durian, who measured random sphere motion near the wall through the spectroscopy of scattered laser light, and the 1992 paper of Rahman and Campbell, who measured the average granular pressure of random sphere impact on a porous steel membrane. While the inverse scaling of the fluctuation velocity with sphere diameter, and the existence of a fundamental length scale for gas fluidization, DoB, had not been a feature of any published fundamental model, or computer simulation, of the steady state granular temperature of spheres in gas fluidized beds, we show that it is a feature of two recent dense kinetic fluidization models published in 1999, by Buyevich and Kapbasov, and Koch and Sangani. Both theories implicitly define a fundamental length scale for the fluctuation velocity, D⁎ = (\ensuremath{\mu}f2 / \ensuremath{\rho}p2g)1 / 3, where \ensuremath{\rho}p is the sphere density, \ensuremath{\mu}f is the gas viscosity, and g is the laboratory gravitational field. The new data for polymer, glass, nickel and stainless steel spheres presented in this paper, defines DoB = (56 \pm{} 2)D⁎. We use the Anderson–Jackson stability model to show that the length scale DoB, also defines a stability length scale, such that for D b DoB(D N DoB), the uniform dense phase of the fluidized bed is stable (unstable), against one dimensional, first order fluctuations in sphere concentration. The length scale, DoB is thus the theoretical equivalent to the empirical scaling length introduced by Geldart, DB/A, to distinguish spheres (D N DB/A) that bubble at fluidization, from spheres (D b DB/A) that fluidize before bubbling. Finally, we present new experimental data, on the remarkable changes in the granular temperature, bed expansion, and bed collapse time, between Geldart B and Geldart A monodispersed glass spheres, and compare that data to granular temperature, and bed expansion, for Geldart A rough, non-spherical, log-normal dispersed diameter catalytic particles.},

  abstract      = {Chemical-looping combustion is a two-stage process proposed as an alternative for the combustion of carbonaceous materials, such as natural gas or coal gas, for almost complete CO2 capture. In the reduction stage, the structural oxygen contained in the lattice of a reducible inorganic oxide, is used for combustion of the carbonaceous material. In the regeneration stage the oxygen carrier, found in a reduced state after the reduction stage, is regenerated with pure air to recover the physical and chemical properties of the carrier, ready to reinitiate a new cycle reduction-regeneration. In a typical multicycle reactor test, the carriers are subjected to accumulative chemical and thermal stresses and the performance will, probably, decay progressively with the number of cycles. The occurrence of some side reactions may limit the efficiency of the overall process in CO2 capture. In this paper, titania-supported iron oxides with different iron loadings have been tested in multicycle tests in a fixed-bed reactor at 900 \textdegree{}C and atmospheric pressure, as oxygen carriers for the chemical-looping combustion of methane. The study shows that the available oxygen for methane combustion in the reduction stage is lower than expected since the active phase interacts with the support forming FeTiO3 ilmenite. The reactivity of these iron based carriers in the reduction stage is independent on the iron oxide content but lower than that exhibited by other tested carriers, such as CuO or NiO. However, iron carriers are cheaper no showing any tendency to carbon deposition.},

Based on the mechanisms through which naphtha hydrocarbons are converted, we evaluated the best alternatives for processing these streams to produce light olefins and/or to reduce olefins content in commercial gasoline. The experimental set-up allowed us to simulate the cracking behaviour of the different naphtha streams in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit by different processing schemes. Results indicate that LSR only cracks at high severity, yielding large amounts of dry gas. Despite its high olefins content, FCCN practically does not crack when it is fed together with gas oil feed. When cracking FCCN alone at typical gas oil cracking conditions, olefins are transformed preferentially into naphtha-range isoparaffins and aromatics, and when cracking FCCN at high severity, olefins are transformed preferentially into propylene and butylenes. Finally, cracking naphtha in the stripper produces some propylene and increases the aromatics in the remaining gasoline.},

Critical thinking can be a vague term both difficult to grasp and even more so to measure. Using a longitudinal case study we analyse quantitative and qualitative data collected over three years to explore the overarching question: ``how do we know students have thought critically?''. We investigate and evaluate the quantitative data that emerged from students undertaking the CTA and the impact of this on their performance. The results indicate that students who performed well in the CTA achieved a final grade for the course of 5 or more (Credit, Distinction or High Distinction). Qualitative data from student feedback demonstrated that the CTA was a significant factor in reinforcing student learning, enabling us to identify areas of misconception and areas in which they could improve. While the study is situated in an engineering context at the University of Queensland, the paper is an exemplar of embedded and sustainable practice, is equally transferable to other disciplinary contexts.},

A clear understanding of such definitions and its consequences over the inversion temperature values is of major importance, as well as the way to estimate the inversion temperature of interest for a given practical evaporation process. Analytical expressions are proposed for some possible definitions of the inversion temperature. Special emphasis is devoted to the physical reasoning on the existence of the inversion temperature and how its value is affected by other variables such as humidity level, mass flow rate and geometry of the evaporative system.},

Single water droplets with a post-impact diameter of approximately 1 mm and n-heptane droplets approximately 5 mm in diameter were gently placed on aluminum and copper surfaces that were maintained at temperatures below the saturation temperatures of the liquids, and the evaporation was observed at atmospheric pressure. The droplets were videotaped throughout the entire evaporation process and transient variations of the diameter, height were measured. From the measured quantities, the contact angle and evaporation rates were calculated and used to predict the heat transfer rate on the surface. The results show that the trends in the wetted diameter, height and contact angle for water droplets are fundamentally different than the geometric changes for heptane droplets. Even though the evaporation rates of the n-heptane droplets were an order of magnitude greater than the water droplets, the heat fluxes for the n-heptane droplets are approximately an order of magnitude less than the water drops. The experimental results are compared with recent analytical models which predict the evaporation rates of small liquid droplets.},

Automation of reaction optimization, in particular, would remove the need for expert input by designing algorithms to statistically analyze the reaction and automatically generate suggested results. In addition, automation can save time and resources, and reduce random human error. However, automation software is commonly coupled to a specific laboratory or device setup or not freely available for use. Rxn Rover is an open-source, modular automation platform for reaction discovery and optimization. Primarily targetting smaller research groups, it is designed using interchangeable plugins to be flexible and easy to integrate into a variety of laboratory environments. Using the Rxn Rover plugin architecture, novel optimization algorithms, analysis instrumentation, and reactor components can be used with minimal or no programming experience. The capability of Rxn Rover is demonstrated in the optimization of a reduction reaction of imine to amine, relevant to energy conversion and manufacturing of fine and commodity chemicals. The reaction was optimized separately using optimizer plugins for SQSnobFit, a Python implementation of the SNOBFIT global optimization algorithm, and Deep Reaction Optimizer (DRO), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm designed for reaction optimization. Using plugins designed for pumps, temperature controllers, and an online liquid chromatography system, the flow reaction was able to be controlled by each algorithm to automate reaction optimization for up to three days, at which point the results were gathered. A successful optimization was performed with SQSnobFit, achieving 70\% yield and 95\% selectivity, while no successful optimizations were achieved with DRO. Regardless of algorithm performance, Rxn Rover was able to successfully automate both multi-day optimization searches.},

Original signals could be resolved with respect first to scale, and then to time and amplitude into a periodic function and three irregular changes \v{Z}micro-scale fluctuations, and meso-scale irregular amplitude and time fluctuations.. Statistical analysis indicated that the three kinds of irregular components are of random characteristics, with a complicated evolution of their probability density distributions with changing operating conditions. A new distribution function, called Compound Weibull distribution with seven parameters, was developed to describe the irregular fluctuations of flow structure, leading to a nonlinear dynamic model for simulating dynamic behaviors of heterogeneous flow structure in gas–solid fluidization, which has been coded into a software package. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

A fully three-dimensional computational model of the nozzle system has been developed and all appropriate approximations and simplifications are described. A multi-phase Eulerian-Eulerian model incorporating the kinetic theory for solid particles is used. Numerical results are obtained using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software FLUENT. The results indicate that solid entrainment in the ESE system is a strong function of both geometry and flow. The optimal entrainment is seen to occur when the ratio of the draft tube diameter D to separation distance I is approximately unity. At this value, the jet of injected gas is seen to spread fully into the opening of the draft tube causing the highest transport of solid particles through the tube. The entrainment is shown to increase with increasing jet velocity across the full range of flows considered. The results are consistent with similar experimental results. The results of this study should find immediate application in the design and implementation of ESE nozzle systems.},

Whereas there has been considerable effort to develop new biomass gasification, combustion, pyrolysis and bio-conversion processes, relatively few authors have characterized the relevant flow characteristics of biomass particles in fluidized beds or investigated measures that could assist in resolving flow issues. The limited work that has been reported on biomass fluidization primarily treats means of achieving fluidization, mixing and segregation. Most of the work has been in low-velocity fluidized beds, although circulating fluidized beds are also important.

  abstract      = {The present study discusses the structural changes of Tahe crude oil components which were treated with acoustic cavitation catalyzed by nickel oleate. In these studies, rheological analysis, SARA analysis, FTIR quantitative analysis and gas chromatography were applied. The results reveal that cavitation effect can damage the wax crystal structure in crude oil, resulting in viscosity reduction. With cavitation treatment, the asphaltene molecules become polymerized and the length of the branched chain becomes shorter. Meanwhile, long-chain alkanes are broken into relatively short alkanes. Nickel-based catalyst dissolves in the crude oil to provide more active sites and promotes the polymerization and chain-broken reaction. Moreover, addition of nickel oleate can inhibit the absorption of light components by resin and increase the amount of light components, thereby enhancing the viscosity reducing effect.},

  abstract      = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

  abstract      = {Liquid distributor is an important internal in packed distillation columns. One of the key features of this equipment is the drip point density, which corresponds to the number of irrigation points per area of the cross-section. For gravity liquid distributors, increasing the number of irrigation holes generally requires small hole diameters, which makes the equipment more sensitive to plugging. In this work, we disclose a new gravity liquid distributor that achieves large drip point densities without requiring smaller irrigation holes. This distributor is an adaptation of the classic orifice-pan type, in which we add a tree-like structure made of wires to spread the liquid dripping from the orifices. The liquid flows outside the wires and splits several times over the different branching levels before falling on the packed bed. From an orifice-pan configuration with drip point density of 736 pts/m2, we designed and constructed enhanced distributors with a theoretical irrigation density of 14,800 pts/m2. Performance comparison using a recently disclosed structured packing shows that these enhanced distributors can decrease HETP from 0.45~m to 0.27~m.},

Alternatively, methane pyrolysis can produce hydrogen without direct CO2 emissions and with modest electricity inputs, serving as a bridge from fossil fuels to renewable energies. Microwaves are an efficient method of adding the required energy for this endothermic reaction. This study introduces a new method of CO2-free hydrogen production via non-plasma methane pyrolysis using microwaves and carbon products of this process. Carbon particles in the fluidized bed absorb microwave energy and create a hot medium ({$>$}1200~\textdegree{}C) in contact with flowing methane. As a result, methane decomposes into hydrogen and solid carbon achieving over 90\% hydrogen selectivity with \sim{}500 cumulative hours of experiments This modular pyrolysis system can be built anywhere with access to natural gas and electricity, enabling distributed hydrogen production.},

Based on supervised machine learning (ML), inline mixing images and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are directly associated for realizing intelligent PIMU predictions. RESULTS Image sets can be reduced to less than 3\% of the data size at the same time as retaining 98\% of information using principal component analysis (PCA). The CFD results, as referenced values for ML, were justified by mixture sampling experiments. Enhanced images for the long-mixing tube effectively trained models including generalized linear model (GLM), support vector regression (SVR), BP-neural network (NNW), and classification and regression trees (CART). By testing the re-collected images, the verification accuracy of GLM was less than 95\% and it failed to recognize uniformity differences under varying working conditions, whereas NNW, CART and SVR realized it with an accuracy for NNW and CART higher than 97\% and for SVR slightly lower than 97\%. By testing images of the jet mixer, the prediction accuracy compared with the CFD results of NNW and CART was also higher than 97\%, although that for SVR was relatively lower, and insignificant declines in accuracy were observed on comparing the results with mixture sampling experiments. CONCLUSION PCA facilitates evaluations of CFD-referenced PIMU using image-based ML. Models trained by enhanced image sets of the long-mixing tube have satisfactory performance. NNW and CART performed slightly better than SVR, and they can be used as tools to improve the rationality when evaluating PIMU in DNIS. \textcopyright{} 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Examples of practical interest include pulsing flow in the case of cocurrent downflow of gas and liquid through a packed column, and voidage fluctuations in fluid-solid flows. In these examples, the local mean volume fractions and velocities of each phase can bc described by similar volume-averaged macroscopic models. In one dimension, fully developed flow takes the form of periodic waves travelling at constant speed through the bed. The shape of waves having observable wavelength is dictated by proximity to a heteroclinic connection in the travelling wave frame between two unstable uniform solutions having the same total volumetric flux. Consequently, the properties of the fully developed travelling waves can be determined by locating the two connected fixed points. A concise operating diagram can be constructed for the gas-liquid-packing system in terms of the externally applied fluxes of each phase. Qualitatively different solutions are obtained in each region of the operating diagram. Application of these methods to models for fluid-solid flow is also discussed.},

  abstract      = {Many relief scenarios involve the discharge of a two-phase fluid mixture, and the proper method for sizing the relief valve for these conditions is the subject of considerable discussion. Sizing a valve is based on the flow through an isentropic nozzle, the pressure–density relation for the fluid properties, and a discharge coefficient (Kd) to match the calculated mass flux to that measured for the flow of air or water in the actual valve. For single-phase flow, this is straightforward, since the fluid properties are simple and measured values of Kd are available. For two-phase flow, the density–pressure relation is complex and no values of Kd are available, so a variety of ``models'' have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. Since the various models produce various results, the appropriate value of Kd required to match the model to the actual valve will depend on the model. This paper utilizes a simple, rigorous method for sizing relief valves for two-phase flow that utilizes the fluid properties directly and hence does not require a ``model'' for these properties. It is shown how this method can be applied to two-phase frozen or flashing (equilibrium or non-equilibrium) nozzle flows, and how the available values for Kd for single-phase flow can be used directly with this method, depending on the critical state of flow in the nozzle, to accurately predict two-phase flow in any valve. The calculations are compared with data from the literature for frozen air/water and flashing steam/water flows in actual safety relief valves.},

  abstract      = {Amine-functionalized metal organic frameworks (MOFs) such as Mg2(dobpdc) have shown some of the highest capacities for CO2 capture under simulated direct air capture (DAC) conditions, i.e., at a CO2 partial pressure at 0.4 mbar. The most widely studied materials of this kind have adsorption isotherms whose shape is controlled by the material's underlying cooperative adsorption mechanism for CO2. Previous analyses of these materials, however, have focused primarily on equilibrium adsorption. Here, we study adsorption of CO2 in aminefunctionalized MOFs under ultradilute conditions relevant to DAC using a packed bed breakthrough system to understand the challenges of using these materials in practical separations. By examining the effects of flow rate, temperature, and CO2 concentration on the observed breakthrough profiles, we show how the isotherm shape, mass transfer resistances and adsorption/desorption kinetics impact the system's performance. An empirical model for the packed bed that accounts for the cooperative reaction mechanism for adsorption of CO2 in N,N\ensuremath{'}-dimethyl ethylene diamine (MMEN)-Mg2(dobpdc) is developed. The kinetics of CO2 adsorption at CO2 concentrations of 400 ppm are characterized through an Avrami model, while at higher CO2 concentrations, a kinetic model based on a Michaelis-Menten expression is more successful. It is also suggested that, at low concentrations, mass transfer rate is limited by cooperative insertion of CO2. Overall, this work has identified the system performance (i.e., rate of CO2 extraction, CO2 capture fraction, and breakthrough curve types) for different feed concentrations of CO2. Critically, this work shows that the use of materials with stepped isotherm for applications such as DAC has some fundamental challenges that cannot be addressed by efforts that focus solely on modifying the overall equilibrium adsorption capacity or swing capacity.},

Two groups of bed materials (three quartz sand–spent fcc catalyst mixtures with different initial mass \% of sand and two coal–iron mixtures, one with almost same sizes but with different densities and the other having both different sizes and densities) were used. Using local axial mass \% of heavier/ coarser particles and their mean sizes the extent of segregation was evaluated. The influence of operating conditions like superficial gas velocity and solids circulation rate on segregation was examined and found that with their increase segregation effects generally tend to decrease and a uniform mixture conforming to initial composition of the mixture results. Using the data available in the literature and those of the present authors an empirical correlation to obtain the extent of segregation in CFBs has been proposed.},

The gas velocities maintained in the range of 2.01 to 4.681m/s and solids circulation rate between 12.5 to 50 kg/m2s. Three quartz sand-FCC catalyst mixtures with different initial weight \% of sand and two coal-iron ore mixtures were used. The difference in local mean particle sizes of the components of the binary mixture has been observed in the riser of a circulating fluidized bed. Due to the larger mean particle size of sand and due to their lower solids density, the measured particle sizes of this fraction show higher values than FCC. For the same size of bed materials consisting of coal and iron ore mixture the variation of the mean particle size for the both has found to be very narrow. Again the axial segregation for the coal/iron ore mixture has been studied in terms of terminal settling velocity of the particles with the aid of a laser particle analyzer. The result showed a continuous classification of bed materials along the riser of a CFB.},

The real voidage profiles have been found out by incorporating gas and solid friction factor and shear stress at the wall of column in the momentum balance equation. To study the flow regimes, the transport velocity (Utr) was determined from the ( PL/L)–Ug–Gs relationship. The gas velocity at which solid hold-up in the upper dilute region exhibits a maximum value is defined as the fast transition velocity (UTF) and the transition velocity to pneumatic transport as UFD. In the present work, two correlations have been proposed for both the transition velocities.

  abstract      = {With continuous depletion of fossil fuels, a hike in global temperature due to CO2 emissions, and increasing population of Earth, the demand for alternative green renewable energy sources has become undeniable. Hydrogen, a potential fuel for energy production, can be produced in a green way by water electrolysis with little to no carbon emissions. As some parts of the world still face the challenge of a drinking water crisis, using clean, drinkable water for hydrogen production becomes a concern. Households, agriculture, pharmacies, and industries release a lot of polluted wastewater into the environment, increasing biological oxygen demand and causing ecological imbalance. If wastewater is used as a feedstock for producing hydrogen, it can address both the energy crisis and water scarcity. In this review, hydrogen production from wastewater is classified into two parts: direct production and wastewater treatment methods followed by hydrogen generation. The technology, beyond all doubt, can be beneficial for green hydrogen generation, reducing carbon emission and contributing to a net-zero future.},

It is shown that the simplest version of the core-annulus model gives the correct magnitudes of slip velocity and average solids hold-up. The anomaly in the core-annulus model, whereby diffusion of particles is towards the region of high solids concentration, is ascribed to the presence of clusters, diffusion towards the wall occurring in the dilute regions between clusters. The clusters are conjectured to be fragments of the relatively dense particle film falling near the wall: this film is shown to have features in common with a film of ordinary liquid flowing down a vertical surface. Implications for scale-up are discussed, using published data showing that very large CFBs exhibit core-annulus flow. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

We report a dependence of logKow for both systems, with highest removal (100\% in 20\,min with AC-PC, 37\% in 120\,min, or 350 passes, with HC-PC) and synergy (Synergistic index of 2.8 and 1.2 for AC-PC and HC-PC, respectively) associated with the more hydrophobic compound, dichloroaniline. HC-PC performance increased and synergy decreased with increasing catalyst loading, and the inverse effect was found with initial concentration (C0: 17.5 to 70\,ppm). Similarly, pH decreased performance but increased synergy and low re-circulating flow rate increased performance but decreased synergy. Detailed analysis of these results indicated the utilisation of in-situ generated H2O2 from recombined OH radicals is the main contributor of the observed synergy, and not physical interactions between cavities and photocatalyst particles. Following this, for the first time, influence of cavitation device type (based on linear flows and swirling flows) and device scale on overall performance of HC-PC system was quantified. Vortex based cavitation device was found to provide a 20\% and 25\% higher performance and synergy compared to a linear flow based cavitation device like orifice. The results presented here provide valuable insights into the synergy of HC and photocatalytic systems.},

  abstract      = {Aqueous wastes containing organic pollutants can be efficiently treated by wet air oxidation (WAO), i.e. oxidation by molecular oxygen in the liquid phase, under high temperature (200 to 325\textdegree{}C) and pressure (up to 150 bar). In western Europe, only an handful of industrial plants are in operation. Most of them were designed by extrapolating results from pilot plants. Only a very few studies have been devoted to the scientific design of such reactors (bubble columns). This paper discusses what needs to be known for this scientific design. The usual design methods assume that the column is divided into a number of cells. Each cell is a perfectly mixed reactor connected with the contiguous cells. Reliable data and models are available for hydrodynamics (axial dispersion, gas hold up) and mass transfer. Data are also needed for the kinetics of chemical reactions and are available from numerous sources, but have not yet been generalised. The thermodynamics (fugacities and enthalpy) ofthe gas phase can be determined with the Peng Robinson equation of state, and the Henry law for the solubility of gases in water describes the equilibrium conditions. But additional data are needed for water solutions containing salts. This paper describes a method that allows such a determination to be made by establishing rigorous balances on a batch autoclave. At present, these data are being used to implement a computer program aimed at determining the performance of a wet air oxidation reactor depending on the various operating parameters. Some typical profiles within the reactor are presented, establishing that the pH of the solution is a very important parameter.},

This method is suited to the elimination of special aqueous wastes from the chemical industry as well as to the treatment of domestic sludge. It is an enclosed process, with a limited interaction with the environment, as opposed to incineration. Usually, the operating cost is lower than 95 Euro m-3 and the preferred COD load ranges from 10 to 80 kg m-3. Only a handful of industrial reactors are in operation world-wide, mainly because of the high capital investment they require. This paper reviews the major results obtained with the WAO process and assesses its field of possible application to industrial wastes. In addition, as only a very few studies have been devoted to the scientific design of such reactors (bubble columns), what needs to be known for this scientific design is discussed.

  abstract      = {There is a need to find methods to intensify the anaerobic digestion process. One possibility is the use of pretreatment techniques. Many laboratory tests confirm their effectiveness, but in most cases, there is no verification work carried out on industrial plants. A reliable and complete evaluation of new solutions can only be carried out in plants that reflect operating conditions at a higher readiness technological level. This has a direct impact on the scientific value and, above all, on the high application value of innovative technologies. The aim of our research carried out under laboratory conditions and on a large scale was to determine the technological and energy efficiency of the use of hydrodynamic cavitation in the pretreatment of a waste mixture from dairy farms. It has been shown that hydrodynamic cavitation significantly increases the concentration of organic compounds in the dissolved phase. In the most effective variants, the increase in the content of these indicators was over 90\% for both COD and TOC. The degree of solubilisation achieved was 49 \pm{} 2.6\% for COD and almost 52 \pm{} 4.4\% for TOC. Under laboratory conditions, the highest effects of anaerobic digestion were achieved after 10 min of pretreatment. The amount of biogas was, on average, 367 \pm{} 18 mL/gCOD, and the amount of methane was 233 \pm{} 13 mL/gCOD. Further large-scale optimisation trials showed that after 8 min of hydrodynamic cavitation, the biogas yield was 327 \pm{} 8 L/kgCOD with a CH4 content of 62.9 \pm{} 1.9\%. With this variant, the net energy yield was 66.4 \pm{} 2.6 kWh/day, a value that was 13.9\% higher than the original variant with 10 min of disintegration and 3.1\% higher than the variant without pretreatment.},

  abstract      = {The characteristics of excess aerobic granular sludge, related to its structure and chemical composition, limit the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. For this reason, pre-treatment methods and compositions with other organic substrates are used. In earlier work, no attempt was made to intensify the methane fermentation of the excess aerobic granular sludge by adding fatty waste materials. The aim of the research was to determine the effects of co-digestion of pre-hydrodynamically cavitated aerobic granular sludge with waste fats on the efficiency of methane fermentation under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The addition of waste fats improved the C/N ratio and increased its value to 19. Under mesophilic conditions, the highest effects were observed when the proportion of volatile solids from waste fats was 25\%. The amount of biogas produced increased by 17.85\% and CH4 by 19.85\% compared to the control. The greatest effects were observed in thermophilic anaerobic digestion at 55 \textdegree{}C, where a 15\% waste fat content in volatile solids was ensured. This resulted in the production of 1278.2 \pm{} 40.2 mL/gVS biogas and 889.4 \pm{} 29.7 mL/gVS CH4. The CH4 content of the biogas was 69.6 \pm{} 1.3\%. The increase in biogas and CH4 yield compared to pure aerobic granular sludge anaerobic digestion was 34.4\% and 40.1\%, respectively. An increase in the proportion of waste fats in the substrate had no significant effect on the efficiency of methane fermentation. Strong positive correlations (R2 {$>$} 0.9) were observed between biogas and CH4 production and the C/N ratio and VS concentration.},

  abstract      = {To date, microwave radiation has been successfully used to support the chemical hydrolysis of organic substrates in the laboratory. There is a lack of studies on large-scale plants that would provide the basis for a reliable evaluation of this technology. The aim of the research was to determine the effectiveness of using microwave radiation to support the acidic and alkaline thermohydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass prior to anaerobic digestion on a semi-industrial scale. Regardless of the pretreatment options, similar concentrations of dissolved organic compounds were observed, ranging from 99.0 \pm{} 2.5 g/L to 115.0 \pm{} 3.0 in the case of COD and from 33.9 \pm{} 0.92 g/L to 38.2 \pm{} 1.41 g/L for TOC. However, these values were more than twice as high as the values for the substrate without pretreatment. The degree of solubilisation was similar and ranged between 20 and 28\% for both monitored indicators. The highest anaerobic digestion effects, ranging from 99 to 102 LCH4/kgFM, were achieved using a combined process consisting of 20 min of microwave heating, 0.10–0.20 g HCl/gTS dose, and alkaline thermohydrolysis. For the control sample, the value was only 78 LCH4/kgFM; for the other variants, it was between 79 and 94 LCH4/kgFM. The highest net energy gain of 3.51 kWh was achieved in the combined alkaline thermohydrolysis with NaOH doses between 0.10 and 0.20 g/gTS. The use of a prototype at the 5th technology readiness level made it possible to demonstrate that the strong technological effects of the thermohydrolysis process, as demonstrated in laboratory tests to date, do not allow for positive energy balance in most cases. This fact considerably limits the practical application of this type of solution.},

  abstract      = {Gas–solid heat transfer in rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry is theoretically and numerically investigated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the particle bed temperature response to a step change in the fluidization gas temperature are presented to illustrate the gas–solid heat transfer characteristics. A comparison with conventional fluidized beds is made. Rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry can operate at centrifugal forces multiple times gravity, allowing increased gas–solid slip velocities and resulting gas–solid heat transfer coefficients. The high ratio of the cylindrically shaped particle bed ``width'' to ``height'' allows a further increase of the specific fluidization gas flow rates. The higher specific fluidization gas flow rates and increased gas–solid slip velocities drastically increase the rate of gas–solid heat transfer in rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry. Furthermore, both the centrifugal force and the counteracting radial gas–solid drag force being influenced by the fluidization gas flow rate in a similar way, rotating fluidized beds in a static geometry offer extreme flexibility with respect to the fluidization gas flow rate and the related cooling or heating. Finally, the uniformity of the particle bed temperature is improved by the tangential fluidization and resulting rotational motion of the particle bed. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanoemulsions were characterized by the polydispersity index and mean particle diameter. These results showed an average diameter of 59 to 69 nm. The pectin and 30\% of neem oil nanoemulsions showed a 27\% reduction in WVP. In addition, the mechanical property was optimized. Young module showed a 66\% to 75\% reduction for pectin and 30\% of carnauba wax film and pectin and 30\% of neem oil film. In the biodegradability analysis was presented a very fast degradation in soil. In addition, there was no macroresidue formation in soil with neem oil films during the biodegradation process. This result showed a weight loss after 45 days of testing. Developed bionanocompositie materials have great potential for application in emerging packagings (edible films and coatings) for the food industry and agribusiness area (food and seeds).},

Gas–particle interaction can be studied with the use of the lattice Boltzmann model (LBM), while the particle–particle interaction can suitably be studied with a discrete particle model.

  abstract      = {We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.},

An adsorbed atomic oxygen and a gaseous ethylene molecule through modified or original Eley-Rideal mechanisms were responsible for both the partial and complete oxidation of ethylene. The partial oxidation engaged an additional uncovered active site in surface reaction compared to the complete oxidation. The surface reaction was the rate-limiting step under the experimental conditions. The proposed model is in remarkable agreement with the experimental data. The addition of CO2 to the feed was proved detrimental to the EO selectivity, only suppressing the EO production rate. Temperature raise was much in favor of the CO2 production rate, decreasing the EO selectivity.},

Embedding enzyme microparticles speeds up polyester degradation, but compromises host properties and unintentionally accelerates the formation of microplastics with partial polymer degradation6,8,9. Here we show that by nanoscopically dispersing enzymes with deep active sites, semi-crystalline polyesters can be degraded primarily via chain-end-mediated processive depolymerization with programmable latency and material integrity, akin to polyadenylation-induced messenger RNA decay10. It is also feasible to achieve processivity with enzymes that have surface-exposed active sites by engineering enzyme–protectant–polymer complexes. Poly(caprolactone) and poly(lactic acid) containing less than 2 weight per cent enzymes are depolymerized in days, with up to 98 per cent polymer-to-small-molecule conversion in standard soil composts and household tap water, completely eliminating current needs to separate and landfill their products in compost facilities. Furthermore, oxidases embedded in polyolefins retain their activities. However, hydrocarbon polymers do not closely associate with enzymes, as their polyester counterparts do, and the reactive radicals that are generated cannot chemically modify the macromolecular host. This study provides molecular guidance towards enzyme–polymer pairing and the selection of enzyme protectants to modulate substrate selectivity and optimize biocatalytic pathways. The results also highlight the need for in-depth research in solid-state enzymology, especially in multi-step enzymatic cascades, to tackle chemically dormant substrates without creating secondary environmental contamination and/or biosafety concerns.},

Although radial uniformity is observed in both reactors, the radial distribution of products is more uniform in the downer than in the riser. At the same feed conversion, about 5.5 wt.\% higher gasoline yield is predicted in the downer due to the less axial backmixing and flatter radial distribution of gas– solids velocity and solids concentration. The simulation results also show that the radial gas dispersion plays an important role in determining the radial distribution of products. The profiles of gasoline in both riser and downer are calculated, and the simulation results of different models compared, showing that the consideration of radial non-uniformity is necessary. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract      = {Particle degradation can be a significant issue in particulate solids handling and processing, particularly in pneumatic conveying systems, in which high-speed impact is usually the main contributory factor leading to changes in particle size distribution (comparing the material to its virgin state). However, other factors may strongly influence particles breakage as well, such as particle concentrations, bend geometry, and hardness of pipe material. Because of such complex influences, it is often very difficult to predict particle degradation accurately and rapidly for industrial processes. In this article, a general method for evaluating particle degradation due to high-speed impacts is described, in which the breakage properties of particles are quantified using what are known as ``breakage matrices.'' Rather than a pilot-size test facility, a bench-scale degradation tester has been used. Some advantages of using the bench-scale tester are briefly explored. Experimental determination of adipic acid has been carried out for a range of impact velocities in four particle size categories. Subsequently, particle breakage matrices of adipic acid have been established for these impact velocities. The experimental results show that the ``breakage matrices'' of particles is an effective and easy method for evaluation of particle degradation due to high-speed impacts. The possibility of the ``breakage matrices'' approach being applied to a pneumatic conveying system is also explored by a simulation example.},

  abstract      = {Over the past couple of decades, polymers that depolymerize end-to-end upon cleavage of their backbone or activation of a terminal functional group, sometimes referred to as ``self-immolative'' polymers, have been attracting increasing attention. They are of growing interest in the context of enhancing polymer degradability but also in polymer recycling as they allow monomers to be regenerated in a controlled manner under mild conditions. Furthermore, they are highly promising for applications as smart materials due to their ability to provide an amplified response to a specific signal, as a single sensing event is translated into the generation of many small molecules through a cascade of reactions. From a chemistry perspective, end-to-end depolymerization relies on the principles of self-immolative linkers and polymer ceiling temperature (Tc). In this article, we will introduce the key chemical concepts and foundations of the field and then provide our perspective on recent exciting developments. For example, over the past few years, new depolymerizable backbones, including polyacetals, polydisulfides, polyesters, polythioesters, and polyalkenamers, have been developed, while modern approaches to depolymerize conventional backbones such as polymethacrylates have also been introduced. Progress has also been made on the topological evolution of depolymerizable systems, including the introduction of fully depolymerizable block copolymers, hyperbranched polymers, and polymer networks. Furthermore, precision sequence-defined oligomers have been synthesized and studied for data storage and encryption. Finally, our perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in the field will be discussed.},

It is shown that coke is deposited on the catalyst within the first 50 ms, probably at the first contact of feedstock and catalyst from non-selective initial cracking of the feedstock. In these initial reactions, the gasoline selectivity is low in favor of a higher gas production. After this initial conversion, the reactions taking place can be described by first-order reaction kinetics with a constant catalyst activity as a function of residence time. When a catalyst is used in a second run without regeneration, the activity is still significant, although much lower than that after regeneration. The overall selectivity of the reused catalyst is almost identical to the overall selectivity of the regenerated catalyst. The initial coke deposition found is so fast that it is strongly governed by internal diffusion limitations resulting in an egg-shell deposition on the catalyst matrix. \textcopyright{}1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract      = {There is a critical need for efficient and reliable active flow control strategies to reduce drag and noise in aerospace and marine engineering applications. While traditional full-order models based on the Navier–Stokes equations are not feasible, advanced model reduction techniques can be inefficient for active control tasks, especially with strong non-linearity and convection-dominated phenomena. Using convolutional recurrent autoencoder network architectures, deep-learning-based reduced-order models have been recently shown to be effective while performing several orders of magnitude faster than full-order simulations. However, these models encounter significant challenges outside the training data, limiting their effectiveness for active control and optimization tasks. In this study, we aim to improve the extrapolation capability by modifying the network architecture and integrating coupled space–time physics as an implicit bias. Reduced-order models via deep learning generally employ decoupling in spatial and temporal dimensions, which can introduce modeling and approximation errors. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel technique for learning coupled spatial–temporal correlation using a three-dimensional convolution network. We assess the proposed technique against a standard encoder–propagator–decoder model and demonstrate a superior extrapolation performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the three-dimensional convolution network, we consider a benchmark problem of the flow past a circular cylinder at laminar flow conditions and use the spatiotemporal snapshots from the full-order simulations. Our proposed three-dimensional convolution architecture accurately captures the velocity and pressure fields for varying Reynolds numbers. Compared to the standard encoder–propagator–decoder network, the spatiotemporal-based three-dimensional convolution network improves the prediction range of Reynolds numbers outside of the training data.},

Whereas the incorporation of CNCs decreased the moisture content and water vapor permeability of the AA/CWN/CNC film, the additional incorporation of either EO decreased the transparency and affected the microstructure of the AA/CWN/CNC/EO nanocomposites. MEO and CEO incorporation improved the thermal stability of the films and provided excellent protection against fruit-spoiling fungi. Because of their excellent barrier properties against fungal growth, water vapor permeability, and ultraviolet and visible light, these AA/CWN/CNC/EO films have promising potential for application as active food packaging or coating materials.},

  abstract      = {Three-dimensional, time-dependent Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations of the turbulent gas–solid flow in a cyclone separator have been performed. The Eulerian description of the gas flow is based on lattice-Boltzmann discretization of the filtered Navier–Stokes equations, where the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model has been used to represent the effect of the filtered scales. Through this large-eddy representation of the gas flow, solid particles with different sizes are tracked. By viewing the individual particles (of which there are some 107 inside the cyclone at any moment in time) as clusters of particles (parcels), we study the effect of particle-to-gas coupling on the gas flow and particle behavior at appreciable mass-loading (0.05 and 0.1). The presence of solid particles causes the cyclone to lose some swirl intensity. Furthermore, the turbulence of the gas flow gets strongly damped. These two effects have significant consequences for the way the particles of different sizes get dispersed in the gas flow. It is anticipated that the collection efficiency gets affected in opposite senses: negatively by the loss-of-swirl, positively by the reduced turbulence.},

These insights we use to interpret the behavior of fluidized suspensions consisting of mixtures of spheres and cylinders with an emphasis on cylinder orientation distributions and slip velocities between solids and liquid phase.

  abstract      = {Planar information of velocity from 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and large eddy simulation (LES) data have been studied using multiresolution wavelet transform (WT) formalisms, i.e., discrete and continuous WT. Identification of dominant energy containing structures with their characterization in terms of fractal spectra have been carried out for industrially important equipment exhibiting turbulent behavior. These include annular centrifugal contactor, jet loop reactor, ultrasound reactor, channel flow, stirred tank and bubble column reactor. The characterization of their dynamics based on denoising the data and studying the local energy along the WT scales show sensitive variation and this helps in identifying the size and shape of structures. A dependency is seen between mixing time and the higher order moments of length scale distribution, viz., skewness and kurtosis and a generalized correlation has been built up for important types of equipment and associated flow parameters. The correlation is not only based on the knowledge of reactor geometry and operating conditions but also on the flow structures via their statistical parameters. Wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) methodology has been used to study the evolution of structures and their interaction in a reduced dimensionality by evaluating the fractal spectra. Classification studies have been carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) of the fractal spectra. The results obtained show clear classes for the six types of equipments and delineate regimes to obtain benchmark patterns of flow hydrodynamics based on PCA co-ordinates. This methodology offers a generalized way for the optimal design and operation of different types of reactors.},

Using one configuration, particle size was proven to have a major role in lithium extraction. Lithium extraction efficiency decreases if the particles are too large. The third phase \ensuremath{\gamma}-spodumene is less reactive than \ensuremath{\beta}-spodumene and has a negative effect on lithium extraction. The other configuration showed that thermal plasmas were able to perform spodumene conversion with results close to that of traditional heating methods, electrical heating or gas burners. Thermal plasmas were proven to decrepitate coarse particles into micrometric particles with a lithium content increase in lower sized fractions. The lithium extraction was proven to be possible on plasma converted samples with lithium extraction efficiencies similar to that of classical heating methods for the lower sized fractions. This means that thermal plasmas could be used to replace CO2 and NOx emitting heating methods such as gas burners in spodumene conversion with similar results while consuming harmful gases instead of producing them, reducing the environmental impact of the process.},

Radial fluidization of the particle bed is created by introducing a radially inwards motion of the fluidization gas, towards a centrally positioned chimney. Correctly balancing the centrifugal force and the radial gas–solid drag force requires an optimization of the fluidization chamber design for each given type of particles.

Modern studies credited games with some advantages in education from different angles (behavioural, motivational or cognitive). In this paper, the application of games that have an explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose (serious games) in different chemical engineering subjects at the bachelor and master level is discussed. Firstly, some topic definitions are provided along with a historical perspective of the use of games in education and the theoretical foundations supporting it. In section 2, four different applications of games are presented in three different subjects. In particular, the use of board games for the subjects Process Control and Particle Technology is illustrated, and how the combination of simple games (e.g. crosswords) and escape room activities can help to develop both low level and high level skills (following the Bloom's taxonomy classification) in Optimisation of Chemical Processes is also presented. Their analysis and discussion of the impacts achieved with the different game-based activities are later presented in section 3 along with the main conclussions drawn.},

Enhancement of cavitation forms an emerging field in this context. A semi-circular annular protrusion has been introduced into Venturi tubes for cavitation intensification. Initially, improved multiphase flow-cavitation chemical effect simulations are constructed, enabling accurate estimations of the cavitation process on multiscale. Based on this model, an in-depth analysis is carried out to reveal the influential mechanisms of protrusion. Subsequently, optimization of protrusion structure is conducted through a comprehensive analysis of cavitation flow characteristics. The interaction between pressure and protrusion structure are further explored utilizing multi-factor optimization methods. Results indicate a significant performance improvement on the cavitating Venturi tube with a semi-circular annular protrusion. This is attributed to an extended low-pressure area, prolonged high-speed duration, and the increase in both collapse pressure and temperature, yielding higher amounts of free radicals. The semi-circular protrusion is superior to the triangle and rectangle shape. Its position and height significantly impact cavitation intensity in accordance with the generated cavitation patterns, pressure distribution, velocity magnitude and streamlines. Interactive factors analysis reveals strong linear relationships between optimal protrusion height, position and inlet pressure (R2~=~0.999 and 0.992). In comparison to smooth Venturi tubes, recommended designs have shown the vapor volume fraction enhanced by 212~\%, 230~\%, 255~\%, and 117~\% at 3, 4, 5, and 6~bar. Accordingly, the \Elzhlmrk{}OH prediction multiplies to 23 times, 33 times, 107 times and 3 times. This study provides theoretical backing for engineering applications of the semi-circular annular protrusion in Venturi tubes and contributes towards improved cavitation efficiency and reduced experimental and time costs.},

The SCVDs have dual functionality and the efficacy of catalytic cavitation reactors get enhanced using process intensifications of the type H2O2 addition, pH modification, and combined approach of HC+ pH+ H2O2 apart from the advantage of low pressure drop for the vortex flow based cavitation in vortex diode (\ensuremath{\Delta}P of 1~bar). Complete, 100\%, degradation of metformin (MTF) was achieved within 5~min with integration of optimized H2O2 dose and exceptionally high synergistic index value over 300, indicating extraordinary synergy for both Cu and Ni-SCVD. Acidic condition promote degradation and a complete degradation with a high 43–48\% mineralization was observed using HC+ pH 4+ (1:200) H2O2 with less intermediates formation. The SCVDs reveal remarkable enhancement of \sim{}9800\% in per-pass degradation and 1400–3400\% in cavitational yield as compared to conventional cavitation process under similar conditions. The newer SCVDs with catalytic activity can provide more cost-effective solutions for industrial and real-life applications.},

The ethylene oxidation results were compared to a previous study (Dixon, Chem. Eng. Sci., 168, 156–177 (2017)) of endothermic steam methane reforming (SMR). The 1-D pseudo continuum reactor model predicted too high a reaction rate compared to the PRCFD simulations. Unlike the endothermic SMR, manipulation of the fluid-particle heat and mass transfer coefficients did not improve agreement. For the 2-D pseudo continuum reactor model, agreement was not helped by the inclusion of radial voidage and velocity profiles, but was improved by the radial heat transfer model, again in contrast to SMR. These results arose from the differences between heating from the strong heat flux applied to the tube wall, and from the weaker heat source supplied by reaction in the main fixed bed.},

  abstract      = {The pursuit of materials with enhanced functionality has led to the emergence of metamaterials--artificially engineered materials whose properties are determined by their structure rather than composition. Traditionally, the building blocks of metamaterials are arranged in fixed positions within a lattice structure1–19. However, recent research has revealed the potential of mixing disconnected building blocks in a fluidic medium20–27. Inspired by these recent advances, here we show that by mixing highly deformable spherical capsules into an incompressible fluid, we can realize a `metafluid' with programmable compressibility, optical behaviour and viscosity. First, we experimentally and numerically demonstrate that the buckling of the shells endows the fluid with a highly nonlinear behaviour. Subsequently, we harness this behaviour to develop smart robotic systems, highly tunable logic gates and optical elements with switchable characteristics. Finally, we demonstrate that the collapse of the shells upon buckling leads to a large increase in the suspension viscosity in the laminar regime. As such, the proposed metafluid provides a promising platform for enhancing the functionality of existing fluidic devices by expanding the capabilities of the fluid itself.},

Generally, aluminum minerals in bauxites are present in the form of gibbsite, boehmite or diaspore. Usually, these mineral forms are mixed in bauxite as a boehmite-diaspore or a gibbsite-boehmite mixture with different weight ratios. The Al2O3 recovery, as well as the kinetic parameters, during the Bayer leaching process of different bauxite types strongly depends on their mineralogical composition. In this paper an attempt was made to develop a mathematical model which enables calculation of the Al2O3 recovery from boehmite-diaspore or gibbsite-boehmite bauxite based on kinetic parameters available for leaching the ``pure'' bauxite types (containing only diaspore, boehmite or gibbsite as the main alumina bearing mineral form) and the mineral composition of the bauxite mixture.

Five different reaction pathways during H0-DBT hydrogenation were considered including middle-ring preference (middle-side-side, MSS), side-middle-side order of hydrogenation (SMS), side-ring preference (SSM), simultaneous hydrogenation of all three rings without intermediate formation and statistical hydrogenation without any ring preference. Detailed analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of the H0-DBT hydrogenation over time revealed that the reaction proceeds with a very high preference for the SSM order at temperatures between 120 \textdegree{}C and 200 \textdegree{}C and 50 bar in the presence of a Ru/Al2O3-catalyst. HPLC analysis supported this interpretation by confirming an accumulation of H12-DBT species prior to full hydrogenation to H18-DBT with middle ring hydrogenation as the final step.},

In addition to plant seeds, green biomass from dedicated crops or green agricultural waste is also available as an alternative source to fulfill the protein and nutrient needs of humans and animals. The development of extraction and precipitation methods (such as microwave coagulation) for chloroplast and cytoplasmic proteins, which constitute the bulk of leaf protein, will allow the production of leaf protein concentrates (LPC) and protein isolates (LPI). Obtained LPC serves as a sustainable alternative source of animal-based protein besides being an important source of many vital phytochemicals, including vitamins and substances with nutritional and pharmacological effects. Along with it, the production of LPC, directly or indirectly, supports sustainability and circular economy concepts. However, the quantity and quality of LPC largely depend on several factors, including plant species, extraction and precipitation techniques, harvest time, and growing season. This paper provides an overview of the history of green biomass-derived protein from the early green fodder mill concept by K\'{a}roly Ereky to the state-of-art of green-based protein utilization. It highlights potential approaches for enhancing LPC production, including dedicated plant species, associated extraction methods, selection of optimal technologies, and best combination approaches for improving leaf protein isolation.},

  abstract      = {The gas–solid mass transfer in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser flow is both structure-dependent and dynamic in nature. Recent progress in multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allows fresh insight into the dynamic flow structure, yet its influence on the mass transfer remains to be settled. To this end, a multiscale mass transfer model is established in this paper based on the extended framework of the energyminimization multiscale (EMMS) model. The relevant algorithm named EMMS/mass is proposed for CFD-coupled mass transfer computation. Two testing cases accounting for sublimation of naphthalene and decomposition of ozone, respectively, are presented to demonstrate the characters of the model. It is shown that structural consideration can have significant effects on the model prediction. The normally used Reynolds number is not adequate to characterize these effects, while the combination of gas velocity and solids flux seems to capture the structural effects and allows to explain the variation of Sherwood number reported for CFB risers in the literature. Sub-grid coupling of this multiscale mass transfer model and CFD approach can be expected to provide a promising tool to probe the dynamic and structure-dependent nature of mass transfer in CFB risers.},

  abstract      = {This article is to test the EMMS-based multiscale mass transfer model through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of ozone decomposition in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor. Three modeling approaches, namely types A, B and C, are classified according to their drag coefficient closure and mass transfer equations. Simulation results show that the routine approach (type C) with assumption of homogeneous flow and concentration overestimates the ozone conversion rate, introduction of structure-dependent drag force will improve the model prediction (type B), while the best fit to experimental data is obtained by the multiscale mass transfer approach (type A), which takes into account the sub-grid heterogeneity of both flow and concentration. In general, multiscale behavior of mass transfer is more distinct especially for the dense riser flow. The fair agreement between our new model with literature data suggests a fresh paradigm for the CFB related reaction simulation.},

The performance of the circular arc curve chamber SEON was studied numerically. Taking the vapor volume distribution and the vapor volume fraction as the evaluation indexes, the influences of the chamber wall profile on the cavitation performance of the circular arc curve chamber SEON were analyzed. In addition, it was compared with the broken-line chamber SEON. The numerical results show that the cavitation performance of the circular arc curve chamber SEON is first enhanced and then weakened by increasing the circular arc radius. The circular arc curve chamber structure can form a larger central cavitation volume in the nozzle, which improves the cavitation performance of the SEON. When the circular arc radius is 2 mm, the cavitation area and the turbulent kinetic energy of the circular arc curve chamber SEON increase by 122.5\% and 16.9\%.},

  abstract      = {Depolymerization is a promising strategy for recycling waste plastic into constituent monomers for subsequent repolymerization1. However, many commodity plastics cannot be selectively depolymerized using conventional thermochemical approaches, as it is difficult to control the reaction progress and pathway. Although catalysts can improve the selectivity, they are susceptible to performance degradation2. Here we present a catalyst-free, far-from-equilibrium~thermochemical depolymerization method that can generate monomers from commodity plastics (polypropylene (PP) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET))~by means of~pyrolysis. This selective depolymerization process is realized by two features: (1) a spatial temperature gradient and (2) a temporal heating profile. The spatial temperature gradient is achieved using a bilayer structure of porous carbon felt, in which the top electrically heated layer generates and conducts heat down to the underlying reactor layer and plastic. The resulting temperature gradient promotes continuous melting, wicking, vaporization and reaction of the plastic as it encounters the~increasing temperature traversing the bilayer, enabling a high degree of depolymerization. Meanwhile, pulsing the electrical current through the top heater layer generates a temporal heating profile that features periodic high peak temperatures (for example, about 600\,\textdegree{}C) to enable depolymerization, yet the transient heating duration (for example, 0.11\,s) can suppress unwanted side reactions. Using this approach, we depolymerized PP and PET to their monomers with yields of about 36\% and about 43\%, respectively. Overall, this electrified spatiotemporal heating (STH) approach potentially offers a solution to the global plastic waste problem.},

Although high-resolution flood simulations have made notable advancements, they remain computationally expensive, underscoring the need for efficient machine learning surrogate models. As a result of sparse empirical observation and expensive data collection, there is a growing need for the models to perform effectively in `small-data' contexts, a characteristic typical of many scientific problems. This research combines the latest developments in surrogate modelling and physics-informed machine learning to propose a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-based surrogate model for hydrodynamic simulators governed by Shallow Water Equations. The proposed method incorporates physics-based prior information into the neural network structure by encoding the conservation of mass into the model without relying on calculating continuous derivatives in the loss function. The method is demonstrated for a high-resolution inland flood simulation model and a large-scale regional tidal model. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by up to 25~\%. This research demonstrates the benefits and robustness of physics-informed approaches in surrogate modelling for flood and hydroclimatic modelling problems.},

The book is divided into three parts: Fundamentals Revisited, Building on Fundamentals, and Beyond the Fundamentals. Part I: Fundamentals Revisited reviews the salient features of an undergraduate course, introducing concepts essential to reactor design, such as mixing, unsteady-state operations, multiple steady states, and complex reactions. Part II: Building on Fundamentals is devoted to "skill building," particularly in the area of catalysis and catalytic reactions. It covers chemical thermodynamics, emphasizing the thermodynamics of adsorption and complex reactions; the fundamentals of chemical kinetics, with special emphasis on microkinetic analysis; and heat and mass transfer effects in catalysis, including transport between phases, transfer across interfaces, and effects of external heat and mass transfer. It also contains a chapter that provides readers with tools for making accurate kinetic measurements and analyzing the data obtained. Part III: Beyond the Fundamentals presents material not commonly covered in textbooks, addressing aspects of reactors involving more than one phase. It discusses solid catalyzed fluid-phase reactions in fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors, gas-solid noncatalytic reactions, reactions involving at least one liquid phase (gas-liquid and liquid-liquid), and multiphase reactions. This section also describes membrane-assisted reactor engineering, combo reactors, homogeneous catalysis, and phase-transfer catalysis. The final chapter provides a perspective on future trends in reaction engineering},

  abstract      = {Changes in the quality of gas--solids contact in going from a 0.05 m dia. fluidised bed of fine iron oxide powder to one with a diameter of 0.64 m have been quantified. An inert gas tracer was employed in the dynamic mode to generate residence time characteristics for each system, and model fitting was used to estimate mass transfer from the bubbles to the dense phase. A comprehensive model screening is carried out to identify the most reasonable modelling approach. Four currently popular models are taken from the literature, and a fifth, based on multiple plug flow units in parallel for the bubble phase, is put forward. This model is termed the multiple bubble-track or MBT model, and screening results show that it describes this particular system on both scales of operation with marginally greater precision than the well-known May--Van Deemter [2, 3] model and significantly greater precision than any of the other three models. This suggests that the multiple plug flow concept is sound and mechanistically more correct than the assumption on which the other models are based. Crossflow ratios estimated on the basis of the MBT model point to the existence of a strong scale-up effect for this fine, dense particle system. As expected [20, 21], most of the crossflow activity occurs in the grid region: this holds for both small and larger beds. The upper regions of the large bed appear to be fairly inactive from an interphase mass transfer point of view and the presence or otherwise of vertical coils is shown to have very little effect on crossflow.},

A dynamic gas tracer system based on a pair of rapid-response mass spectrometers was employed, and the tracer itself was argon delivered in the form of a pulse. Concentration- time responses were recorded at two elevations, and system transfer characteristics were extracted in the form of variance increase and peak-to-peak velocity. The variance change in the bed was found to decrease with increasing gas velocity and to increase initially with increasing solids circulation. This increase with a rise in solids flux appeared to weaken at high solids mtes. Peak-to-peak velocities were found to display a maximum at a superficial gas velocity of around 4 - 5 m/s and, when the variance data are processed in to the form of axial dispersion coefficients, a similar peak emerges. One possible explanation is that a radially symmetrical core/annulus structure exists at low velocities, and that beyond about 5 m/s this structure gives way to a more random lateral distribution of lean and dense regions. A possible distinction between ``fast fluidisation''and ``riser transport'' is suggested on this basis.},

Contact efIiciencies have been measured for two grades of sand (140 and 275 pm) and 71 pm FCC catalyst. The measurement technique is based on hot gas as a reacting tracer, with detection by a shrouded rapid-response thermocouple. The rate at which hot gas is thermally equilibrated with the bed is measured and this is interpreted in terms of the degree to which gas and solid come into intimate contact. The results show that, as particles become finer, contact efficiencies improve. However, this improvement is significantly less than the corresponding increase in total gas-solid surface area in the system. Finer particles are likely to form clusters or streamers more readily, and it appears that coarse particles are more surface-efficient in that they expose a greater proportion of external surface to the main gas stream. In other words, the difference in contact efficiency performance between a fine and a coarse powder is reduced by the tendency of the finer powder to aggregate more strongly.},

This practical guide helps you make the transition to writing idiomatic Rust--while also making full use of Rust's type system, safety guarantees, and burgeoning ecosystem.  If you're a software engineer who has experience with an existing compiled language, or if you've struggled to convert a basic understanding of Rust syntax into working programs, this book is for you. By focusing on the conceptual differences between Rust and other compiled languages, and by providing specific recommendations that programmers can easily follow, Effective Rust will soon have you writing fluent Rust, not just badly translated C++. Understand the structure of Rust's type system Learn Rust idioms for error handling, iteration, and more Discover how to work with Rust's crate ecosystem Use Rust's type system to express your design Win fights with the borrow checker Build a robust project that takes full advantage of the Rust tooling ecosystem},

Some aspects of the fundamental characteristics of the gas-solid flow with evaporative liquid injection, including real time and time averaged cross-sectional solids concentration distributions, the cross-sectional solids concentration fluctuations and the quasi-3D flow structures are studied. A two-region model and a direct image calculation are proposed to describe the dynamic behavior in both the bubble/void phase and the emulsion phase based on the tomographic images. Comparisons are made between the fundamental behaviors of the gas-solid flows with and without evaporative liquid injection for various gas velocities ranging from bubbling to turbulent fluidization regimes. Significant differences are observed in the behavior of the gas-solid flow with the evaporative liquid injection compared to the fluidized bed without liquid injection.},

Whilst simulation and optimisation of simple distillation systems are fairly straightforward, the design of more complex structures, such as dividing wall columns (DWC), can prove problematic due to failure to initialise or to converge, and no adequate shortcut methods exists for these structures. In this work, a novel shortcut method is presented which can solve the shortcut design problem simultaneously also for complex structures using a simple optimisation procedure without the need for iterative manual calculations. The method is illustrated by four case studies. The shortcut design variables obtained using this method can be used to initialise rigorous simulation or optimisation problems, thus greatly reducing the risk of initialisation failure or convergence issues, also for very complex structures.},

It emphasizes the fact that most multiphase systems of industrial interest (e.g. stirred tanks, slurry bubble columns, gas–solid or liquid–solid risers and fluidized beds, pneumatic transport reactors, etc.) operate in churn turbulent flow at large volume fraction of the dispersed phase and are opaque. This inevitably leads to the use of the Euler–Euler, interpenetrating fluid model in describing their fluid dynamics, which raises issues of closure for the interfacial momentum terms and turbulence. Hence, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models based on the Euler–Euler approach with selected closures require experimental validation. Due to the non-transparency of the systems involved, non-conventional experimental techniques are required.},

Computational fluid dynamics is an attractive tool to virtually prototype grit-chamber designs. This study assesses a two-phase unsteady Reynolds-averaged Euler-Euler (uRANS-EE) approach to predict bubble induced recirculatory flow in a laboratory tank of similar complexity to that expected in a full-scale grit-chamber. Numerical results are validated against a comprehensive experimental data set consisting of a 3D reconstruction of the flow field using a multi-plane stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique, void fraction profiles using an optical probe and bubble rise-velocities using high-speed video. Depending on the combination of modeling parameters the predicted volumetric fluid flux returning towards the diffuser varied between 60 and 97\% of the experimental flux. Predicted rise velocities exceeded measured values by a factor between 1.15 to 1.75 and near bed velocities were underpredicted by upwards of 25\%. The principal 3D flow field features were predicted to a sufficient accuracy to support the use of the uRANS-EE approach for numerical grit-chamber prototyping.},

Under simulated realistic conditions two distinctive time frames can be identified. In the `initial time-frame', during the first 50 ms of catalyst-oil contact, radical reactions play an important role, leading to the large extent of unselective conversion of the feed to coke, H2, and C1–C4. The presence of catalyst external surface area enhances radical reactions. Coke deposits mainly on the outer surface of the catalyst particle, thereby reducing its accessibility and apparent catalytic cracking activity. After 50 ms, during the `steady-state time-frame', radical reactions play a negligible role and no coke, H2, and C1–C2 are formed. In this stage, b-scission is dominant. A lumped kinetic scheme is proposed to describe the observed phenomena and how gasoline yield penalties could be avoided in commercial risers. Calculations on feed reactivities and mass-transfer have been made in order to describe the processes taking place on a molecular scale.},

Stranded gas can be effectively converted in a catalytic process by methane decomposition into solid carbon and a hydrogen/methane mixture that can be directly fed to a hydrogenation unit to load a LOHC with hydrogen. This allows for a straight-forward separation of hydrogen from CH4 and conversion of hydrogen to a hydrogen-rich LOHC material. Both, the hydrogen-rich LOHC material and the generated carbon on metal can easily be transported to destinations of further industrial use by established transport systems, like ships or trucks.},

Intermediaries can be crucial in facilitating such alignments, especially where cross-sectoral interactions are essential for the niche's development. Compressed biogas is an emerging socio-technical niche in India that is constituted by actors and institutions spread across the agriculture and energy sectors. This study explores the identities and roles of intermediaries involved in developing India's nascent compressed biogas niche. Based on semi-structured interviews with multiple stakeholders, the study found that the intermediaries carried out three crucial functions for niche development. First, they helped to ensure the feedstock availability for compressed biogas production by maintaining a well-functioning cross-sectoral supply chain. Second, they helped align the regime-level institutions to the niche's needs. Third, they helped in expanding the geographical footprint of the niche. Based on empirical findings, the study proposes an analytical framework to illustrate different dimensions of intermediation for niche development in socio-technical transitions. The framework can help future research explore intermediaries' multi-faceted role in socio-technical niche development, especially in multi-system transitions.},

  abstract      = {This paper addresses computational models for dilute gas-particle multiphase flow in which the three dimensional, time-dependent fluid motion is calculated in an Eulerian frame, and a large number of particles are tracked in a Lagrangian frame. Point forces are used to represent the back effect of the particles on the turbulence. The paper describes the early development of the technique, summarizes several experiments which show how dilute particle loadings can significantly alter the turbulence, and demonstrates how the point-particle method fails when the particles are comparable in scale to the small scale turbulence. High-resolution simulations and experiments which demonstrate the importance of the flow details around individual particles are described. Finally, opinions are stated on how future model development should proceed.},

The effects of particle rotation and lift forces are included in the particle tracking model. The present predictions are compared with published experimental data for single-phase and two-phase flows. The comparisons show that the RNG based k-\ensuremath{\epsilon} model predicts the flow behaviour better than other models. Furthermore, the particles concentration and velocity are compared very well with published data. The effects of inlet gas velocity, bend geometry, loading ratio and particle size on the flow behaviour and bend pressure drop are also discussed.

  abstract      = {Driven by the ongoing migration towards Industry 4.0, the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered smart manufacturing and digital transformation. AI enhances the migration towards industry 4.0 through AI-based decision-making by analyzing real-time data to optimize different processes such as production planning, predictive maintenance, quality control etc., thus guaranteeing reduced costs, high precision, efficiency and accuracy. This paper explores AI-driven smart manufacturing, revolutionizing traditional approaches and unlocking new possibilities throughout the major phases of the industrial equipment lifecycle. Through a comprehensive review, we delve into a wide range of AI techniques employed to tackle challenges such as optimizing process control, machining parameters, facilitating decision-making, and elevating maintenance strategies within the major phases of an industrial equipment lifecycle. These phases encompass design, manufacturing, maintenance, and recycling/retrofitting. As reported in the 2022 McKinsey Global Survey (https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review), the adoption of AI has witnessed more than a two-fold increase since 2017. This has contributed to an increase in AI research within the last six years. Therefore, from a meticulous search of relevant electronic databases, we carefully selected and synthesized 42 articles spanning from 01 January 2017 to 20 May 2023~to highlight and review the most recent research, adhering to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and shedding light on the latest trends and popular AI techniques adopted by researchers. This includes AI techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM) etc., which are extensively discussed in this paper.~Additionally, we provide insights into the advantages~(e.g., enhanced decision making) and challenges (e.g., AI integration with legacy systems due to technical complexities and compatibilities)~of integrating AI across the major stages of industrial equipment operations. Strategically implementing AI techniques in each phase enables industries to achieve enhanced productivity, improved product quality, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. This exploration of the potential of AI in smart manufacturing fosters agile and resilient processes, keeping industries at the forefront of technological advancements and harnessing the full potential of AI-driven solutions to improve manufacturing processes and products.},

The results were investigated using proximity analysis, ultimate analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and fatty acid analysis. Cell disruption of algae was achieved using two methods, i.e., bead milling and acid treatment. Acid treatment resulted in a slightly higher lipid recovery than bead milling. The result showed high degree disruption was achieved with a lipid recovery of 97.05~\%, 136.36~\% and 65~\% with acid treatment and 82.35~\%, 50~\% and 30~\% with bead milling for Spirulina platensis, Nannochloropsis oceanica and Enteromorpha flexuosa, respectively.

Natural processes are grouped under biocomplexity, while man-made processes are treated as complexity alone. We restrict our attention in this paper to systems that do not change their structure during the process, so that self-organizational criticality is explained, but not utilized. Computational complexity is intrinsically inherent in all the processes we consider, but it is not given much attention in this paper.

  abstract      = {From a sustainability perspective, a synergy between hydrogen, electricity and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is particularly attractive. A combination of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and PEM electrolyzers provides a back-up system for RES avoiding the intermittency: electrolyzers convert the excess of energy from RES into hydrogen and PEM fuel cells use this hydrogen to convert it back into electricity when it is needed. Models are an essential tool in electrolyzer development because it allows to understand the influence of different parameters on the electrolyzer performance enabling an efficient simulation, design and optimization of electrolyzer systems. Modelling studies have been developed with different degrees of complexity. This review presents a compilation of published models focusing on the main equations used to predict cell voltage, including reversible voltage, activation losses, ohmic losses and mass transport losses. Special sections are devoted to dynamic behaviour, two-phase flow effects and inclusion of thermal effects in model development. Also, a brief description of empirical/semi-empirical models is provided. This review aims to provide the main guidelines for the beginners on PEM electrolyzer modelling and, for this purpose, includes a section with the technology basic principles.},

  abstract      = {To achieve high-throughput generation of monodisperse double emulsions via controllable symmetric splitting, the splitting dynamics of double emulsions in Y-shaped microchannels are systematically investigated by the combination of experimental study and numerical simulation. Four distinct breakup flow patterns of double emulsions splitting are initially identified, namely non-breakup, once uneven breakup, twice uneven breakup and twice even breakup, and the underlying hydrodynamic mechanisms of each flow pattern are further elucidated through the flow field structures and pressure distributions. The results show that the upstream pressure created by the flow obstruction of continuous phase governs the stable and symmetric splitting of double emulsions in Y-shaped microchannels. Effects of the flowrates of continuous phase, the outer and inner diameters of double emulsions, the physical properties of all the inner, middle and outer fluids as well as the angle of Y-shaped microchannel on the flow pattern transition laws are systematically clarified, and the corresponding universal flow pattern diagrams for predicting the critical boundary for the transition of flow patterns are established. Based on controllable symmetric splitting of double emulsions, three-level splitting microfluidic networks are rationally designed to achieve high-throughput generation of monodisperse double emulsions as well as monodisperse microcapsules via template synthesis. The results in this study not only advance the deep understanding of the breakup dynamics of double emulsions in Y-shaped microchannels, but also offer valuable guidance for the rational design of microfluidic devices for mass production of monodisperse double emulsions, thus providing a significant contribution to the fields of micro-chemical engineering and droplet microfluidics.},

  abstract      = {Static and dynamic metamaterials have been extensively studied for their ability to manipulate different physical fields and directed to broad applications. Because the governing equations of heat transfer consist of nonlinear terms with conservation of mass, momentum and energy, the equations can exhibit elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic and hybrid configurations under different transfer modes. Such multi-mode transfer characteristics intrinsically make thermal metamaterials distinguish themselves from other metamaterials with unique static and dynamic manipulation mechanisms. Therefore, numerous studies have emerged that use the transformation theory and other methods to control static thermal metamaterials. It leads to the development of thermal cloaks, thermal concentrators, thermal diodes, and so on. Originating from the static style, the manipulation of heat transfer has expanded to dynamic systems in recent years. The introduction of hydrodynamics in metamaterial design leads to numerous novel physics effects, such as dynamic cloaking, zero-drag characteristics, topological heat transfer, nonreciprocal diffusion, and non-Hermitian physics. Moreover, the dynamic thermal metamaterials allow accurate control at both time and space dimensions, leading to exciting applications such as adjustable, reconfigurable, and intelligent thermal meta-devices. However, few studies have systematically analyzed thermal metamaterials from the perspective of static and dynamic manipulation. In this review, we aim at clarifying the connection and distinction of static and dynamic manipulation from the scopes of principle, application, and physical effects. We start with the development of static thermal metamaterials and its application. Subsequently, the development of dynamic thermal metamaterials is presented both in fundamental theory and application. Finally, we summarize the research directions and prospect future research challenges for static and dynamic thermal metamaterials.},

In this study, a nonintrusive reduced order modeling method, the reduced order model based on principal component analysis and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (PBLSTM ROM), was developed to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics of fluidized beds. By combining principal component analysis and Bidirectional long- short-term memory networks, the PBLSTM ROM effectively extracted dynamic evolution information without any prior knowledge of governing equations, enabling reduced-order modeling of unsteady flow fields. The PBLSTM ROM was validated using the solid volume fraction and gas velocity flow fields of a fluidized bed with immersed tubes, showing superior performance over both the PLSTM and PANN ROMs in accurately capturing temporal changes in the fluidization fields, especially in the region near immersed tubes where severe fluctuations appear. Moreover, the PBLSTM ROM improved the simulation speed by five orders of magnitude compared to traditional computational fluid dynamics simulations. These findings suggest that the PBLSTM ROM presents a promising approach for analyzing the complex fluid flows in engineering practice.},

They have to be taken into account in SMB numerical models to scale-up processes. In the present work, CFD is used as an intermediate step to develop a 1D model simple enough to be used for cyclic SMB simulations while being able to represent realistic hydrodynamics. First, a mock-up representative of an industrial SMB is used to perform residence time distribution (RTD) experiments and to provide validation data. Experiments are well predicted by a CFD model including porous media and turbulent zones, allowing to consider CFD simulations as references to fit simpler models. The moments of internal age distribution are characterized following the calculation method developed by Liu and Tilton, 2010. AIChE J. 56(10), 2561–2572, which allows to estimate the degree of mixing (Liu, 2012. Chem. Eng. Sci. 69(1), 382–393) inside adsorption beds. A major result is that RTD and degree of mixing inside adsorption beds are well described by a 1D multiexit model, unlike classical dispersed plug flow models (Ruthven and Ching, 1989) that were generally used to simulate SMB processes. Additionally, a numerical method was developed which is able to reproduce the RTD with steady state simulations.},

  abstract      = {Machine learning (ML) provides a broad spectrum of tools and architectures that enable the transformation of data from simulations and experiments into useful and explainable science, thereby augmenting domain knowledge. Furthermore, ML-enhanced numerical modelling can revamp scientific computing for real-world complex engineering systems, creating unique opportunities to examine the operation of the technologies in detail and automate their optimization and control. In recent years, ML applications have seen significant growth across various scientific domains, particularly in fluid mechanics, where ML has shown great promise in enhancing computational modeling of fluid flows. In contrast, ML applications in numerical plasma physics research remain relatively limited in scope and extent. Despite this, the close relationship between fluid mechanics and plasma physics presents a valuable opportunity to create a roadmap for transferring ML advances in fluid flow modeling to computational plasma physics. This Perspective aims to outline such a roadmap. We begin by discussing some general fundamental aspects of ML, including the various categories of ML algorithms and the different types of problems that can be solved with the help of ML. With regard to each problem type, we then present specific examples from the use of ML in computational fluid dynamics, reviewing several insightful prior efforts. We also review recent ML applications in plasma physics for each problem type. The paper discusses promising future directions and development pathways for ML in plasma modelling within the different application areas. Additionally, we point out prominent challenges that must be addressed to realize ML's full potential in computational plasma physics, including the need for cost-effective high-fidelity simulation tools for extensive data generation.},

  abstract      = {The Ukraine conflict has put critical pressure on gas supplies and increased the price of fertilisers. As a consequence, biogas has gained remarkable attention as a local~source of both gas for energy and biofertiliser for agriculture. Moreover, climate change-related damage incentivises all sectors to decarbonise and integrate sustainable practices. For instance, anaerobic digestion allows decarbonisation and optimal waste management. Incorporating a biogas system in each country would limit global warming to 2~\textdegree{}C. If suitable policies mechanisms are implemented, the biogas industry could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 3.29–4.36 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which represent about 10–13\% of global emissions. Here, we review the role of the biogas sector in capturing methane and mitigating carbon emissions associated with biogas outputs. Since biogas impurities can cause severe practical difficulties in biogas storing and gas grid delivering systems, we present upgrading technologies that remove or consume the carbon dioxide in raw biogas, to achieve a minimum of 95\% methane content. We discuss the role of hydrogen-assisted biological biogas upgrading in carbon sequestration by converting carbon dioxide to biomethane via utilising hydrogen generated primarily through other renewable energy sources such as water electrolysis and photovoltaic solar facilities or wind turbines. This conceptual shift of 'power to gas' allows storing and utilising the~excess of~energy generated in grids. By converting carbon dioxide produced during anaerobic digestion into additional biomethane, biogas has the potential to meet 53\% of the demand for fossil natural gas. We also evaluate the role of digestate from biogas systems in producing biochar, which can be used directly as a biofertiliser or indirectly as a biomethanation enhancement, upgrading, and cleaning material.},

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of complex processes and complicated geometries embraces the transport of momentum, heat, and mass including the description of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. The paper outlines the numerical models available for analyzing these processes and presents examples of such methodology. The unprecedented growth in computer capability has resulted in efficient simulations of most transport phenomena. The aerospace's interest in high-pressure turbulent combustion has created efficient computational tools for analyzing run-away-reactions in the process industries. Practical turbulence models, generalized thermodynamic properties, and extensive chemical kinetics data bases are currently used in three-dimensional, steady-state simulations. However, industrial needs have challenged CFD modelers to improve their flow solvers in order to simulate flows with more complicated physics, such as spray combustion, acoustic waves, transient start-up and shut-down, and flow instabilities. In addition, the practicality and efficiency of numerical simulations are highly dependent on the submodels employed, such as reaction mechanisms and turbulence models. There has been some progress in generalizing CFD tools, but more development is needed. Most of all, more high-quality and critical test data are required to validate the CFD simulations of complex processes. The laminar transport equations have been averaged by various means to locally describe both turbulent and multiphase flows. Spray combustion, stirred-tank reactors, fluidization of catalytic beds, and highly exothermic supercritical reactors are among the several validated examples, which illustrate today's technology. The designer's access to public-domain, open-source software offers powerful methodology for his use. Such software and the variety of available modeling techniques will be inventoried to demonstrate the scope of computational transport methodology. The current state of CFD models will be assessed to address the need for future research.},

  abstract      = {Advancements in computing power have recently made it possible to utilize machine learning and deep learning to push scientific computing forward in a range of disciplines, such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, materials science, etc. The incorporation of neural networks is particularly crucial in this hybridization process. Due to their intrinsic architecture, conventional neural networks cannot be successfully trained and scoped when data are sparse, which is the case in many scientific and engineering domains. Nonetheless, neural networks provide a solid foundation to respect physics-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce the underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs). These methods provide distinct advantages for accelerating the numerical modeling of complex multiscale multiphysics phenomena. In addition, the recent developments in neural operators (NOs) add another dimension to these new simulation paradigms, especially when the real-time prediction of complex multiphysics systems is required. All these models also come with their own unique drawbacks and limitations that call for further fundamental research. This study aims to present a review of the four neural network frameworks (i.e., PgNNs, PiNNs, PeNNs, and NOs) used in scientific computing research. The state-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed, limitations are discussed, and future research opportunities are presented in terms of improving algorithms, considering causalities, expanding applications, and coupling scientific and deep learning solvers.},

  abstract      = {,  We perform direct numerical simulations of a gas bubble dissolving in a surrounding liquid. The bubble volume is reduced due to dissolution of the gas, with the numerical implementation of an immersed boundary method, coupling the gas diffusion and the Navier–Stokes equations. The methods are validated against planar and spherical geometries' analytical moving boundary problems, including the classic Epstein–Plesset problem. Considering a bubble rising in a quiescent liquid, we show that the mass transfer coefficient kLkLk\_L can be described by the classic Levich formula kL=(2/\surd{}\ensuremath{\pi})\surd{}DlU(t)/d(t)kL=(2/\ensuremath{\pi}--\surd{})DlU(t)/d(t)----------\surd{}k\_L = (2/\textbackslash sqrt \{\{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash pi\} \})\textbackslash sqrt \{\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l\textbackslash,U(t)/d(t)\}, with d(t)d(t)d(t) and U(t)U(t)U(t) the time-varying bubble size and rise velocity, and DlDl\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l the gas diffusivity in the liquid. Next, we investigate the dissolution and gas transfer of a bubble in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence flow, extending Farsoiya et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 920, 2021, A34). We show that with a bubble size initially within the turbulent inertial subrange, the mass transfer coefficient in turbulence kLkLk\_L is controlled by the smallest scales of the flow, the Kolmogorov \ensuremath{\eta}\ensuremath{\eta}\textbackslash eta and Batchelor \ensuremath{\eta}B\ensuremath{\eta}B\textbackslash eta \_B microscales, and is independent of the bubble size. This leads to the non-dimensional transfer rate Sh=kLL\star{}/DlSh=kLL\star{}/Dl\{Sh\}=k\_L L\textasciicircum\textbackslash star /\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l scaling as Sh/Sc1/2\propto{}Re3/4Sh/Sc1/2\propto{}Re3/4\{Sh\}/\{Sc\}\textasciicircum\{1/2\} \textbackslash propto \{Re\}\textasciicircum\{3/4\}, where ReRe\{Re\} is the macroscale Reynolds number Re=urmsL\star{}/\ensuremath{\nu}lRe=urmsL\star{}/\ensuremath{\nu}l\{Re\} = u\_\{rms\}L\textasciicircum\textbackslash star /\textbackslash nu \_l, with urmsurmsu\_\{rms\} the velocity fluctuations, L{\_\ast}L{\_\ast}L\textasciicircum \textasteriskcentered the integral length scale, \ensuremath{\nu}l\ensuremath{\nu}l\textbackslash nu \_l the liquid viscosity, and Sc=\ensuremath{\nu}l/DlSc=\ensuremath{\nu}l/Dl\{Sc\}=\textbackslash nu \_l/\textbackslash mathscr \{D\}\_l the Schmidt number.

  abstract      = {Hydrogen-based shaft furnace technology holds promise for low-carbon hydrogen metallurgy. Since hydrogen-assisted iron ore reduction is highly endothermic, inadequate heat supply relevant to the contact of gas and densely packed ores may reduce the rate and efficiency of reductions. The key to addressing this issue lies in understanding the competition among heat supply, heat transfer, and heat loss driven by the gas flow around ores and reactions within them. Modeling and simulation are crucial for revealing the underlying mechanisms and promoting process scale-up and intensification. This review summarizes previous efforts in physical modeling and model applications for improving the reduction performance. The discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)–DEM models have been used for particle-scale simulation to investigate inhomogeneous particle descent and relevant particle–particle interactions. For macroscale simulations, steady-state simplified models such as plug flow and REDUCTOR, as well as the Eulerian two-phase model, have been developed by considering heat and mass transfer. Based on these model applications, strategies including the optimization of operating conditions and gas-feeding methods have been proposed to improve the furnace performance. Further numerical efforts are needed to analyze the in-furnace heat evolution and reduction and reveal the competitiveness of flow, transport, and reaction by incorporating multiscale physics in shaft furnaces. Additionally, attention could be paid to the effects of particle sticking and degradation on reduction, which may be more serious when the proportion of lump ores increases. When evaluating relative optimization strategies, comprehensive comparisons are expected in terms of iron ore reduction degree, gas utilization rate, energy consumption, and economic feasibility under various reducing and cooling gas operating conditions and furnace profiles to offer practical guidelines for industrial design and intensification.},

  abstract      = {A lattice Boltzmann method for gas-liquid two-phase flow involving non-Newtonian fluids is developed. Bubble formation in a flow-focusing microchannel is simulated by the method. The influences of flow rate ratio, surface tension, wetting properties, and rheological characteristics of the fluid on the two-phase flow are analyzed. The results indicate that the flow pattern transfers from slug flow to dry-plug flow with a sufficiently small capillary number. Due to the presence of three-phase contact lines, the contact angle has a more significant effect on the dry-plug flow pattern than on the slug flow pattern. The deformation of the front and rear meniscus of a bubble in the shear-thinning fluid can be explained by the variation of the capillary number. The reduced viscosity and increased contact angle are beneficial for the drag reduction in a microchannel. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of the current method to simulate the gas-liquid two-phase flow in a microchannel.},

  abstract      = {The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.},

An optimization problem for a production scale milk drying system was implemented and solved, considering plant capacity (maximization) and energy consumption (minimization) as the objective. Decision variables were inputs to the spray unit namely the inlet dry bulb air temperature, concentrate moisture, and dry solids flow rate. Product stickiness conditions and moisture content were the main constraints, which were modeled using mass and energy balances. A non-deterministic derivative free based optimization technique, namely Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was chosen to solve the problem. The results showed that throughput maximization is achieved at the expense of a relative energy consumption penalization in the spray and revealed that the structure of the problem seems to be convex. This study shows a promising non-conventional use of MCMC algorithms in optimization studies.},

Why previous works seemed to numerically confirm the power law solution is explained.

  abstract      = {The importance of methanol as a basic building block of the chemical industry and as a means of chemical energy storage of renewable energy sources (e.g. wind \& PV) will steadily increase in the upcoming years. Based on renewable electricity and through the coupling of a proton-conducting steam electrolyzer for the generation of pure H2 with a heterogeneously catalyzed direct synthesis of methanol from anthropogenic CO2, an attractive method for the production of methanol can be provided. The efficient and economic application and operation of these so-called power-to-methanol processes requires suitable system control and heat integration concepts for alternating operating conditions. In this work, a transient and real-time capable system model of a power-to-methanol process based on tubular proton-conducting high temperature electrolyzers is presented. The obtained stationary simulation results reveal beneficial operational windows and system efficiencies (0.488 to 0.637) with respect to the chosen process design and heat integration concept. The power-to-methanol process model also incorporates a multitude of feedback control loops or controllers, to manipulate relevant operating parameters of all employed sub-processes in case of fluctuating power inputs. Furthermore, the presented studies assess the transient responses of the power-to-methanol system to defined step changes of the apparent cell voltage based on a multitude of negative feedback control loops.},

The most common approaches to modeling cavitation along with the most common modifications to said approaches due to other effects of cavitating flows are identified and categorized. The application of said categorization is demonstrated through an analysis of selected cavitation models. For each of the models presented, the various assumptions and simplifications made by the authors of the model are discussed, and applications of the model to simulating various aspects of cavitating flow are also presented. The result of the analysis is demonstrated via a visualization of the categorizations of the highlighted models. Using the preceding discussion of the various cavitation models presented, the review concludes with an outlook toward future improvements in the modeling of cavitation.},

On addressing the fluidization properties of binary beds of solids differing either in particle density or diameter, the paper shows how interpretations based on definition of a minimum fluidization velocity of the mixture can lead to erroneous conclusions about the influence played by system variables on their behaviour. An alternative method of investigation is followed which takes into consideration the existence of a finite velocity interval, bounded by the ``initial'' and ``final fluidization velocity'' of the mixture, along which the whole process of fluidization has place. The results of a wide series of experiments demonstrate that this alternative approach allows recognizing the independent variables of binary fluidization; they also highlight the differences of behaviour between density- and size-segregating beds.},

  abstract      = {A review is given of flows of dense cohesionless granular materials with a special focus on the question of constitutive equations. The existence of a dense flow regime characterized by enduring contacts is first discussed. We then emphasize that dimensional analysis strongly constrains the relation between stresses and shear rates, and show that results from experiments and simulations in different configurations support a description in terms of a frictional viscoplastic constitutive law. Successes and limits of this empirical rheology are discussed in the light of recent alternative theoretical approaches. Finally, depth averaged methods developed for free surface granular flows are presented.},

The large range of length scales and timescales in turbulent multiphase flows makes direct numerical simulation of the microscale governing equations intractable for many applications. In this article we review a systematic approach for developing large-eddy-simulation (LES) tools for dispersed multiphase flows starting from the microscale model. A key intermediate step is the mesoscopic model for the dispersed phase, formulated in terms of kinetic equations, that contains the physical models for the flow. Owing to the phase-space variables, direct solution of the mesoscopic model is usually intractable, and additional mathematical approximations are introduced to arrive at a macroscopic model. We show that self-conditioned LES models can be derived for both the mesoscopic and macroscopic models, but the former is preferred to ensure consistency and physical accuracy. The principal difficulties and open challenges in closing the LES model equations are highlighted.},

This review article highlights recent key advances in such integration achieved in a joint-research university-national laboratory partnership under the auspices of the United States Department of Energy and parallel efforts worldwide. First, an overview of current and emerging desalination technologies and associated pretreatment, brine treatment, and valorization technologies that together can result in zero-liquid-discharge systems is presented, and their technological readiness levels are evaluated. Then, advanced modeling techniques and new software platforms that enable optimization of solar-desalination applications with the dual objective of cost and environmental impact minimization are discussed.},

To achieve the purpose, some modified work is conducted. The equilibrium distribution function for density is modified in the developed model. The scheme of multiple-relaxation-time is applied to deal with the single-phase and perturbation collision operators to enhance the algorithm stability, and a simple correction term is incorporated into the single-phase operator. In addition, the finite-difference method is adopted to solve the temperature field. The developed model is first used to simulate the layered two-phase flow in a horizontal channel to test the density ratio that can be achieved without temperature effect. Then two classical thermocapillary flow problems of thermocapillary-driven flow in a heated microchannel and thermocapillary migration of a deformable droplet or bubble are simulated, and the model is proven to successfully simulate the thermocapillary flows with density ratios up to 10.},

However, despite their ubiquity, multi-fluid systems with the drop and pool consisting of different liquids are far less well understood. Our hypothesis is that the post-impact dynamics greatly depends on the pool-to-droplet viscosity ratio \ensuremath{\mu}p/\ensuremath{\mu}d, which we explore over a range of six orders of magnitude using a combination of experiments and theoretical approaches (mathematical modelling and direct numerical simulation). Our findings indicate that in this scenario the splashing threshold and the composition of the ejecta sheet are controlled by the viscosity ratio. We uncover that increasing the pool viscosity decreases the splashing threshold for high viscosity pools (\ensuremath{\mu}p/\ensuremath{\mu}d\greaterequivlnt{}35) when the splash comes from the droplet. By contrast, for low viscosity pools, the splash sheet comes from the pool and increasing the pool viscosity increases the splashing threshold. Surprisingly, there are conditions for which no splashing is observed under the conditions attainable in our laboratory. Furthermore, considering the interface velocity together with asymptotic arguments underlying the generation of the ejecta has allowed us to understand meaningful variations in the pressure during impact and rationalise the observed changes in the splashing threshold.},

The microreactor consisted of 80 microchannels with dimensions 0.45~\texttimes{}~0.15~\texttimes{}~50~mm3 in each one with an average 0.04~mm catalytic thickness. Several experimental tests were carried out at various conditions of flow rate (110, 130 and 140~mL/min), temperature (275, 300, 325 and 350~\textdegree{}C) and reactants partial pressure. Kinetic parameters were modeled and fitted using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0 and Matlab 2021~R. Using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), it was determined that a power kinetic model with a low kinetic exponent, 0.12~\leq{}~n~\leq{}~0.18, is adequate to represent a wide range of experimental CO2 conversion and CH4 yield (up to 86\%) data. An activation energy around 83–85~kJ/mol was estimated, as well as a correlation between the different parameters of the power rate law. The temperature raise significantly increases the CO2 conversion and methane yield under the operational conditions used, due to the distance from thermodynamic equilibrium. It was numerically verified that under the experimental conditions the microchannels operate isothermally. Using this model, it is possible to evaluate the effect of operational variables (temperature, volumetric flow and H2/CO2 ratio) and reactor design (microchannel surface/volume ratio) on methane production, proving potential application in catalytic efficiency studies for Power-to-Gas applications. It is clear that processes intensification is useful to achieve higher CO2 conversions fostering sustainable development of closed-carbon production cycles.},

It is thus necessary to estimate the solid concentration pro"le for the design of fast \#uidization reactors. Although the in\#uence of pressure or the density ratio between \#uid and solid on the particle concentration in the circulating \#uidized bed has been experimentally investigated, it has not yet been fully understood theoretically. Not a few plant development units now in operation have, however, been designed on empirical experiences supported by basic experiments. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the in\#uence of the \#uid/solid density ratio on the vertical concentration pro"le by application of the Growing Chain Model. It is found that the distance from the riser top to the point where solid concentration attains actually its "nal value, decreases with increase in the \#uid/solid density ratio, thus making the bed more uniform vertically. The "nal concentration is independent of the \#uid/solid density ratio. These "ndings coincide with some experiments by other investigators. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The batch kinetic model was extended to the mass transfer model for SMBR to determine the operating condition. In SMBR system, calculated elution curves of solketal for extract and raffinate well simulated the experimental behaviors. Calculated concentration profiles within the SMBR helped to understand that the SMBR system for acetalization of glycerol with acetone was significantly affected by the fluctuation of extract flow rate.

  abstract      = {Shortcut models are well established for grassroots design of distillation columns and have been widely applied. However, no shortcut models are available that address retrofit. Shortcut models are quicker to solve, do not have significant convergence problems and are more robust than rigorous models for column optimization. In particular, shortcut models for retrofit would be valuable for evaluating retrofit design options, for improving the performance of existing distillation systems (columns and heat recovery systems) and can be combined with detailed heat-integration models for optimizing existing heat-integrated distillation systems. This paper presents retrofit shortcut models for design of both reboiled and steam-stripped distillation columns. These models are primarily based on a modified Underwood method, the Gilliland and Kirkbride correlations, the Fenske equation and the material balances. The retrofit models are applicable for simple distillation columns, sequences of simple distillation columns, and complex distillation configurations, including columns with side-strippers and side-rectifiers. The models fix both the column configurations and the operating conditions, including steam flow rates, and calculate the product flow rates, temperatures and compositions, and the various heat duties. A comparison of the model results with those of rigorous models of existing distillation columns is presented to validate the model.},

  abstract      = {The paper presents mathematical models of a measuring system for real-time monitoring the net electric charge, the mass flow rate or concentration of charged particles, and the mean flow velocity of the particles in a pipe. The main problem lies in proper defining and establishing the unambiguous relationships between the electric parameters of a measuring system, which uses a probe, sensor or transducer based on electrostatic induction. Such devices are non-contact, non-obstructive ones and are intended for the two-phase flow metering of charged solids in pipelines. The probe's output potential (voltage) is derived as a function of an equivalent point charge representing the net charge of a charged particle column within the probe's sensing zone and flowing in a real pipe as well as a function of the net charge of this column and its dynamic space density. The relationships are established for the above three forms of charge travelling rectilinearly along or parallel to the probe's geometrical axis in a laminar or fully developed turbulent flow. The models presented here show a useful, helpful approach to the modelling of non-contact, non-intrusive measuring systems based on electrostatic induction. The substantial role the capacitance of the electrostatic flow probe itself and the whole measuring system plays in the physical process of electrostatic induction of charge and in the mathematical modelling of the probe and system is interpreted. The capacitance influence on the system bandwidth is also discussed.},

The primary objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound in increasing the utilization of rice straw and to optimize the conditions for maximum biogas yield. Important parameters such as ultrasonic power (0.2–1 W/mL), duty cycle (20\%–80\%), and substrate loading (2\%–10\% w/v) were varied to understand their effects during pre-treatment. The results showed that the maximum increase in soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), with a final value of 13,500 mg/L (an increase of 64.63\%), was achieved under optimum conditions of ultrasonic power of 0.4 W/mL, a duty cycle of 50\%, and a substrate loading of 6\% w/v. Additionally, the study evaluated the effect of low-intensity US exposure during AD with pre-treated rice straw at varying irradiation times (10–30 min) and duty cycles (20\%–60\%). The optimal conditions of ultrasonic time of 20 min and a duty cycle of 50\% resulted in nearly four times higher biogas generation compared to untreated samples. The current research successfully demonstrates the efficient use of US in the feedstock pre-treatment and also in AD process, leading to significant intensification in biogas production within a shorter time frame.},

Results showed that the total yield of SRC ranged from 28.1\% to 37.5\%. A decreased sulfate level was obtained beyond 12\% KOH extraction resulting in increased 3,6-anhydrogalactose (ranged from 26.4\% to 32.5\%). Functional groups were confirmed using FT-IR-spectrum, which mainly showed ester sulfate groups and with a shift in the peak values measured at higher concentrations of KOH. All the formulated films were opaque and flexible with a thickness between 30.5 and 34.1\,\mathrm{\mu}m (moisture: 11.4–14\%). All of the films had good viscoelastic properties (power law exponents (n\ensuremath{'}) being 0.34–0.98) and showed a `gel like' behavior. The X-ray-diffractogram peak showed 2 theta at 28.4\textdegree{}, 37.2\textdegree{}, and 50.4\textdegree{} and was consistent with an amorphous structure. The endothermic peaks varied between 119 and 131\,\textdegree{}C. Higher solubility was obtained in SRC films prepared with 24\% KOH. Among all the formulated films, water vapor permeability ranged between 8.5 and 12.2\,\texttimes{}\,10-10 g\,Pa-1 s-1 m-1 and with high tensile strength ranging between 38.1 and 47.5\,MPa.

Examples of mesoscale structures include gas bubbles in a fluidized bed and particle clusters in a riser. Experimental investigation of these mesoscale structures is challenging and expensive. To this end, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are extensively employed; however, post-processing CFD data to capture mesoscale structures is challenging. This article develops a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)-based methodology to capture and characterize mesoscale structures from multiphase CFD simulation data. DBSCAN is an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, which requires the value of two hyperparameters. A simple technique to calculate these hyperparameters is provided and the performance of DBSCAN is assessed on CFD-DEM simulations of bubbling fluidized beds and particle clustering. We demonstrate the computational complexity of DBSCAN to be 𝒪(nlogn), lower than the existing techniques, by testing its scalability on highly resolved grids (up to 100 million grid points).},

  abstract      = {Numerical simulation of the performance of a commercial FCC riser reactor was carried out by using a three-dimensional gas-particle, two-phase, turbulent flow-reaction model. Results showed that overcracking of desired products, such as diesel or light fuel oil, occurs and the optimum yields of desirable FCC products could be achieved at a critical riser height of less than 20 m above the feed inlet. This suggests that injection of quenching media above the critical riser height can be an effective option for optimizing the yields of desirable products. The reactionterminating technique conducted in a commercial FCC riser reactor, using light waste oil, straight-run gasoline, and desalted water as quenching media produced favorable results. Light fuel oil yields increased by 1.3 wt\% and 0.95 wt\% for using the first two quenching media. Liquefied cracking gas yields increased by 0.43 wt\% and 1.03 wt\%, whereas the yields of dry gas and coke decreased slightly. Desalted water produced better results than either light waste oil or straight-run gasoline. The improvements of gasoline and liquefied gas yields using desalted water are 0.95\% and 0.49\% more than those of using straight-run gasoline, respectively.},

The modified Gidaspow drag model based on the effective mean diameter of the particle clusters predicted the expected bubbling fluidization behavior and bed expansion. Compared with the bed densities of 650.900 kg/m3 in the emptycylinder stripper, bed densities in the V-baffled stripper were 600.800 kg/m3 at the superficial gas velocity of 0.10–0.20 m/s. The overall trend of the time-averaged bed density at various superficial gas velocities were in agreement with the experimental data. The results illustrated that internal baffles had an important effect on the fluidization hydrodynamics. Internal baffles improved break-up and redistribution of bubbles and intensified the gas–solid contact. The simulation results also indicated that appropriate modification of the internal configuration eliminated the dead flow region in the strippers, and enhanced the gas–solid mixing remarkably, showing benefit for the mass and heat transfer in the fluidized bed.},

Nitrogen adsorption, XRD and H2-TPR analysis indicated that La2O3-modified SiO2 had higher surface area, strengthened interaction between Ni and support, and improved dispersion of Ni. CO2-TPD found that La2O3 increased the alkalescence of SiO2 and improved the activation of CO2. Coking reaction (via both temperature-programmed surface reaction of CH4 (CH4TPSR) and pulse decomposition of CH4) disclosed that La2O3 reduced the dehydrogenation ability of Ni. CO2-TPO, O2-TPO (followed after CH4TPSR) confirmed that only part amount of carbon species derived from methane decomposition could be removed by CO2, and O2 in feed played a crucial role for the gasification of the inactive surface carbons. Ni/xLa2O3-SiO2 (x = 10, 15, 30) possessed high activity and excellent stability for autothermal reforming of methane in a fluidized-bed reactor.},

  abstract      = {Lithium production in China mainly depends on hard rock lithium ores, which has a defect in resources, environment, and economy compared with extracting lithium from brine. This paper focuses on the research progress of extracting lithium from spodumene, lepidolite, petalite, and zinnwaldite by acid, alkali, salt roasting, and chlorination methods, and analyzes the resource intensity, environmental impact, and production cost of industrial lithium extraction from spodumene and lepidolite. It is found that the sulfuric acid method has a high lithium recovery rate, but with a complicated process and high energy consumption; alkali and chlorination methods can directly react with lithium ores, reducing energy consumption, but need to optimize reaction conditions and safety of equipment and operation; the salt roasting method has large material flux and high energy consumption, so require adjustment of sulfate ratio to increase the lithium yield and reduce production cost. Compared with extracting lithium from brine, extracting lithium from ores, calcination, roasting, purity, and other processes consume more resources and energy; and its environmental impact mainly comes from the pollutants discharged by fossil energy, 9.3–60.4 times that of lithium extracted from brine. The processing cost of lithium extraction from lepidolite by sulfate roasting method is higher than that from spodumene by sulfuric acid due to the consumption of high-value sulfate. However, the production costs of both are mainly affected by the price of lithium ores, which is less competitive than that of extracting lithium from brine. Thus, the process of extracting lithium from ores should develop appropriate technology, shorten the process flow, save resources and energy, and increase the recovery rate of related elements to reduce environmental impact and improve the added value of by-products and the economy of the process. \textcopyright{}2023 China Geology Editorial Office.},

  abstract      = {Sensing of wind pressures on wind-sensitive structures and wind speeds in densely populated cities is crucial to ensure structure safety and monitoring urban wind environment. However, these wind pressure or wind speed sensors are often sparsely distributed due to their high cost, and consequently the collected wind pressure or speed information is limited. Under these circumstances, it is particularly important to place these limited number of sensors in the optimal locations with the capacity of extracting the most information. In this study, an optimal sensor placement scheme based on multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD), a space post-processing function: signed distance function (SDF) and particle swarm optimization-random forest (PSO-RF) is proposed, called mrDMD-SDF-PSO-RF (mrDSPR). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified using two case studies of reconstruction based on sparse sensors: wind flow field of a city block and wind pressure field of a single building. The result indicates that the proposed scheme significantly improves the efficiency of the sensors. Therefore, based on the proposed optimal sensor placement scheme, the locations of placing sensors can be well-designed for various wind engineering problems, which builds a solid foundation of super-resolution reconstruction of wind pressure on buildings and wind flow field in urban environment.},

We find that at low temperatures (up to 300~\textdegree{}C), gas flows in a near-plug flow pattern, represented by narrow RTD curves with early peaks. As temperature increases to 600~\textdegree{}C, the RTD curves broaden, featuring delayed peaks due to bubble breakup and enhanced gas drag. Between 800~\textdegree{}C and 1200~\textdegree{}C, significant deviations from plug flow emerge, driven by stronger interparticle forces and increased gas transfer to the emulsion phase. Interestingly, beyond 1200~\textdegree{}C, the RTD curves shift back toward plug flow, influenced by intensified interparticle forces and physicochemical changes in the bed materials.},

  abstract      = {Ultrasonic cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities within a liquid due to the action of an ultrasound source. It is widely used for homogenization, dispersion, deagglomeration, erosion, cleaning, milling, emulsification, extraction, disintegration and sonochemistry. On the other hand, the so-called cavitation number is used to assess the likelihood of cavitation in fluid flows within a conduit or around a hydrofoil but it is not valid in ultrasonic cavitation since there is no fluid flow. A recently formulated number predicts the cavitation in case of sudden accelerations. The tip surface of an ultrasonic probe is subjected to a continuous repetition of alternating accelerations at high frequency. Therefore, the use of the recently formulated number in ultrasonic cavitation is explored here. Simulations of the ultrasonic probe in water just at the condition of cavitation onset have been performed for a combination of probe diameters from 0.2 to 100 mm and frequencies 20, 30, 40, 100 and 1000 KHz. The recently formulated number is applied to these combinations and it is found that can be used to predict ultrasonic cavitation. Consequently, the dimensionless number can be used to decide the conditions to avoid or generate cavitation when a fluid is sonicated and to increase reproducibility in such conditions.},

  abstract      = {A particle reaction model including mass and heat transfer has been developed to know the temperature variations produced inside the oxygen carrier particles during the cyclic reduction and oxidation reactions taking place in a chemical-looping combustion (CLC) system. The reactions of the different oxygen carriers based on Cu, Co, Fe, Mn, and Ni during the reduction with fuel gas (CH4, CO, and H2) and oxidation (O2) have been considered. In these systems, the oxidation reaction is always exothermic with subsequent heat release; however, the reduction reaction can be exothermic or endothermic depending on the metal oxide and the fuel gas. The heat generated inside the oxygen carriers during the exothermic reactions increases the particle temperature, and could affect the particle structure if the temperature increase is near to the melting point of the active materials. Several variables that affect the reaction rate and the heat transport process have been analyzed to know their effect on the internal particle temperature. For a given oxygen carrier and reaction, the maximum temperature of the particles depended mainly on the particle size, the reaction rate, and the external heat transfer resistance, being lower than the effect of the oxygen carrier porosity, type of inert material, and metal oxide content. The highest temperature variations were reached for the oxidation reactions, with the maximum corresponding to the Ni and Co oxygen carriers with values of \sim{} + 90 K for 1 mm particles. The highest temperature increase observed during the reduction reactions corresponded to the reaction of CuO with CO, with values of \sim{} + 40 K for 1 mm particles. For the rest of the reactions and metals, the variations in the particle temperature were below 10 K for particle sizes below 1 mm. Under the typical operating conditions that exist in a CLC system, with particle sizes lower than 0.3 mm, 40 wt\% of metal oxide content, and overall conversion times lower than 30 s, the increases of temperature with respect to the bulk conditions were lower than 15 K for any reaction of any oxygen carrier. Moreover, the temperature profiles inside the particles were near flat in most of the practical conditions, and no local points with high temperatures were found. Thus, changes in the solid porous structure of the carrier due to sintering during oxidation in fluidized bed reactors are not expected working at typical temperatures of CLC systems (1000–1300 K).},

Partial least-squares (PLS) methods were able to isolate which group of variables in the chemistry, in the timing of the various stages of the batch, and in the shape of the time-varying trajectories of the process variables were related to a poor-quality product. The industrial study illustrates the approach and the power of these multivariate methods for troubleshooting problems occurring in complex batch processes. Several new variations in the multivariate PLS methodology for the analysis of batch data are also implemented. In particular, an application utilizing a novel approach to the time warping of the trajectories for batches, and the subsequent use of the time-warping information, is presented. The use of the time history of the PLS weights of the process variable trajectories to diagnose problems in the dynamic operation of the batches is also clearly illustrated, as is the use of contribution plots for finding features which distinguished between the operating histories of good and bad batches.},

Among those studied, chemical precipitation is considered the most efficient technology for the extraction of metals from wastewater. This paper outlines the current technology, its challenges, and its environmental impacts. Moreover, it reviews alternative approaches to recover lithium via chemical precipitation, and systematically studies the effects of different operating conditions on the lithium precipitation rate.

  abstract      = {With the increasing concern for climate change, renewable and sustainable energy production has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community, industrial practitioners, and policy and decision-makers. There are many technological alternatives for each sub-category of complex sustainable energy systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an effective tool to compare the environmental impacts of each pathway and identify the most promising alternatives from an environmental impact perspective. This contribution first reviews the environmental assessment methods and tools developed over the years. Secondly, a comprehensive review of the contribution of the PSE community to the environmental impact analysis of renewable energy systems is performed. It is observed that while LCA is the preferred method, these studies differed widely concerning the choice of impact assessment method used, the level of details shared concerning the underlying LCA calculations, and whether or not sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out, among many others. This makes the comparison of results from different studies difficult and often impossible. It is clear that the PSE community, with its emphasis on systems thinking and holistic approaches, plays a critical role in the design, integration, and operation of complex sustainable energy systems. However, the thorough calculations necessary to ensure a robust and transparent LCA analysis require a shared methodology and a detailed description of the rules. Such explicit, systematic, and transparent methods will set the bar for a minimum requirement for thorough LCA calculations, ensuring fair comparison and discussions of different technical solutions developed in the wider PSE community for sustainable renewables.},

  abstract      = {The production of lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide out of lithium bearing ores requires a thermal activation for the phase transition in the mineral to enable an acid or soda leaching in the downstream hydrometallurgical section. In this paper, traditional processing of lithium ores in the lithium industry is reviewed and opportunities to improve product quality and recovery rate by simultaneously reducing energy consumption will be presented. The conventional process for pyro-processing is still based on rotary kiln, a technology in use since the early days of lithium ore processing, albeit not significantly further developed since. A new technology in this field is fluidized-bed calcination. A study of the major process parameters (temperature and residence time) was performed on laboratory and larger bench scale aiming for optimal product quality for subsequent processing. When converting \ensuremath{\alpha}- to both \ensuremath{\beta}- and \ensuremath{\gamma}-spodumene, high conversion rates were achieved for all investigated materials. The conversion of \ensuremath{\alpha}- to only \ensuremath{\beta}-spodumene varies significantly by concentrate. Preferential conditions were temperatures in the range of 1050–1070~\textdegree{}C with retention times of typically 25–40~min. Additional results include the characterization of granulometric properties, in particular the effect of defragmentation by decrepitation, elemental and mineral phase composition, and further aspects specifically related to the application of fluidized bed technology. After identifying optimal process conditions for calcination and proving general feasibility at laboratory scale, the technical feasibility was confirmed for a wide range of spodumene concentrates at bench and pilot scale (20 up to 500~kg/h feed) providing the basis for industrial process design. Thus, spodumene decrepitation through applying fluidized-bed technology is technically feasible for non-sticking material and high and homogenous product quality can be achieved.},

  abstract      = {Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.},

  abstract      = {Recent discussions on the fate of LNG spills into impoundments have suggested that the commonly used combination of SOURCE5 and DEGADIS to predict the flammable vapor dispersion distances is not accurate, as it does not account for vapor entrainment by wind. SOURCE5 assumes the vapor layer to grow upward uniformly in the form of a quiescent saturated gas cloud that ultimately spills over impoundment walls. The rate of spillage is then used as the source term for DEGADIS. A more rigorous approach to predict the flammable vapor dispersion distance is to use a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. CFD codes can take into account the physical phenomena that govern the fate of LNG spills into impoundments, such as the mixing between air and the evaporated gas. Before a CFD code can be proposed as an alternate method for the prediction of flammable vapor cloud distances, it has to be validated with proper experimental data.},

CO2 used as tracer was injected into the centre of the bed from a point source. Radial concentration profiles of tracer gas were measured in two planes downstream of the injection point for a broad range of air velocities and solid fluxes, using two sizes of sand panicles of 710 and 380 p,m. A systematic experiment was carried out to find out the main variables acting on the radial gas mixing in the dilute region of a last tluidized bed. An analytical solution derived by Towle and Sherwood for the description of radial gas mixing in turbulent single-phase flow was applied to determine the radial dispersion coefficients, which were found to be dependent on the superficialgas velocity and solid circulating flux. The D\textasciitilde{} values were well correlated with an apparent suspension Reynolds number ( Re ) by an equation of the type D\textasciitilde{} = aRe \textasciitilde '. The proposed equation allows the radial gas coefficient to be predicted as a function of the air velocity and external solid flux present in the riser. This equation, with it.,;corresponding parameters, is applied to the results of other authors and an acceptable fit was found. The high Pe numbers (5(10--2000) obtained in the dilute region of the fast fluidized bed indicate that the flow of the gas in the dilute region approximates to plug flow. \textasciitilde ) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

However, by physically reproducing many macro-scale phenomena in 'uid 'ow and 'uidization on micro-scales even below the traditional continuum limit, pseudo-particle modeling (PPM, Ge and Li (Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Circulating Fluidized Bed, Beijing, China, Science Press, Beijing, 1996) has suggested the possibility of a more straightforward and penetrating way. In this paper, traditional approaches are reviewed ;rst and then PPM is discussed in full length and validated further. We demonstrate that it has maintained all necessities on the molecular level for comprehensive 'ow description, and the reproduced phenomena, such as bubbling, clustering and radial heterogeneity, have re'ected the fundamental mechanism of their macro-scale counterparts despite the vast scale di4erence. With this digital miniature, every detail of the 'ow can be traced non-intrusively until the lowest level in classic physics and experiment with 'exible parameters, which provides a unique tool for theoretical study and engineering predictions.

Though it is effective for the simulation of local phenomena in particle – fluid systems, its application to practical systems is still limited by computational cost. Therefore, macro-scale PPM, or MaPPM is proposed, which combines finite difference (FD) with weighted averaging techniques to upgrade particle interactions to the fluid element level. In this paper, a detailed derivation of the model is presented together with a clearer demonstration of the convergence and accuracy of the model. The approach is then applied to the problem of plane Poiseuille flow and particle – fluid suspension, resulting in a physically reasonable flow pattern.

This strategy has been extended to six other systems, covering single-phase flow, gas–liquid flow, granular flow and emulsions.

This phenomenon is of direct relevance to many engineering process operations, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), polyethylene synthesis, and electronic materials coating. In this study, the level-set method and the immersed-boundary method are combined to describe the droplet–particle contact dynamics in a fixed Eulerian grid. The droplet deformation is captured by one level-set function while the solid–fluid boundary condition is imposed on the particle surface through the immersed-boundary method involving another level-set function. A two-dimensional vapour-layer model is developed to simulate the vapour flow dynamics. Equations for the heat transfer characteristics are formulated for each of the solid, liquid and gas phases. The incompressible flow-governing equations are solved using the finite-volume method with the ALE (arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) technique. The simulation results are validated through comparisons with experimental data obtained from the new experimental set-up designed in this study. An important feature of the droplet impacting on a particle with film boiling is that the droplet undergoes a spreading, recoiling and rebounding process, which is reproduced by the numerical simulation based on the model. Details of the collision such as spread factor, contact time and temperature distribution are provided. Simulations are also conducted to examine the effects of the particle size and the collision velocity. Although the value for the maximum spread factor is larger for a higher impact velocity and for a smaller particle, the contact time is independent of the impact velocity and particle size. Both the normal collision and the oblique collision are considered in this study.},

Constructing mathematical model is an effective method for analyzing the performance of the rotary wheel as well as the system. The model can also be used to guide system operation, interpret experimental results and assist in system design and optimization. The overall objective of this paper is to provide a review of various efforts that researchers have made to mathematically model the coupled heat and mass transfer process occurring within the wheel. The paper first briefly describes desiccant wheel including fundamental principle, heat and mass transfer mechanism and the method of model establishment. Then various models consisting of ideal assumptions, governing equations, auxiliary conditions, solution methods and main results are presented. The models can be classified into two main categories: (1) gas-side resistance (GSR) model; (2) gas and solid-side resistance (GSSR) model which can be further subdivided into pseudo-gas-side (PGS) model, gas and solid-side (GSS) model and parabolic concentration profile (PCP) model. It shows that GSSR models are higher in precision and more complex compared with GSR models. In addition, the simplified empirical models based on measured data are briefly discussed. This review is useful for understanding the evolution process and status quo of the mathematical model and highlighting the key aspects of model improvement such as taking account of pressure loss or air leakage.},

The effects of temperature on hydrodynamic cavitating flows are investigated to find the optimum reaction conditions enhancing cavitating treatment intensity. Results show that the cavitation performance, including the cavitation intensity and cavitation unsteady behavior, is influenced by (1) cavitation number \ensuremath{\sigma} (the pressure difference affecting the vaporization process), (2) Reynolds number Re (the inertial/viscous ratio affecting the bubble size and liquid–vapor interface area), and (3) thermodynamic parameter \ensuremath{\Sigma} (the thermal effect affecting the temperature drop). With increasing temperature, the cavitation length first increases and then decreases, with a cavitation intensity peak at the transition temperature of 58 \textdegree{}C. With the growth of cavitation extent, the cavity-shedding regimes tend to transition from the attached sheet cavity to the periodic cloud cavity, and the vapor volume fluctuating frequency decreases accordingly. A combined suppression parameter (CSP) is provided to predict that, with increasing CSP value, the cavitation intensity can be decreased. Recommendations are given that working under the low-CSP range (55–60 \textdegree{}C) could enhance the intensification of the cavitation process.},

  abstract      = {The injection of an evaporating liquid into reactors plays an important role in chemical engineering. The liquid may be used for agglomeration processes or as educt like for catalytic cracking reactions. Proper mixing and fast evaporation are useful to increase yield and selectivity of the process. Regarding the fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, the injection of a liquid educt inhibits thermal cracking processes (Chen \& Williams (2005)). Investigations have been carried out with FCC-particles as bed material in a pilot-plant scale riser reactor under varying operating conditions. The inner diameter of the circulating fluidized bed is 190 mm and the height of the Riser section is 11.3 m. The specific mass flux was about 200 kg/(m\ensuremath{^2}s) at a temperature of 300\textdegree{}C. The test liquid water was injected in the middle of the riser via full and hollow cone single fluid nozzles, which were set parallel to the uprising stream of hot catalyst particles. The droplet diameter dv90 of the injected water ranged between 269 and 466 \mathrm{\mu}m. The solid distribution and velocity were measured via capacitance probes and the spray zone was characterized by thermocouple probes. Increasing the superficial gas velocity showed strong impact on the development of the radial solid distribution and the spray zone. The radial temperature profile indicates a very small borderline between the spray zone with temperatures below 100\textdegree{}C and the hot environment of the riser flow.},

Besides the liquid metal temperature, special attention was paid to the influence of the feed gas volume flow rate in the range of 50–200mln/min and the inlet feed gas dilution with nitrogen. Increasing liquid metal temperatures resulted in increasing hydrogen yields, leading to a maximum hydrogen yield of 78\% at 1175\textdegree{}C and 50mln/min methane volume flow rate. Within all experimental runs, less than 1.5mol-\% intermediate products were detected in the product gas. The produced carbon appeared as a powder consisting of flake shaped agglomerations in the size range of 15–20\ensuremath{\mu}m, wherein the particle size varied from 40nm to 100nm. During the experiments, the produced carbon was completely separated and accumulated at the top surface of the liquid metal. Only minor quantities were transported with the off gas stream. Within the liquid metal inventory, a thin carbon layer of about 10\ensuremath{\mu}m, probably partly showing the formation of nanotubes, in the hot reaction zone, had been deposited on the quartz glass reactor wall.},

  abstract      = {We present an Eulerian multiphase approach for modeling the gasification of wood in fluidized beds. The kinetic theory of granular material is used to evaluate constitutive properties of the dispersed solid phase. Comprehensive models for wood pyrolysis, char gasification and homogeneous gas phase reactions are taken into account. The dispersed solid phase within the reactor is modeled as three continuous phases, i.e., one phase representing wood and two char phases with different diameters. In contrast to most other studies we investigate a fluidized bed which consists of wood and char particles without additional inert particles such as limestone or olivine. 2D simulation results for a lab-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor are presented and compared with experimental data for product gas and tar concentrations and temperature. We investigate the influence of two different classes of parameters on product gas concentrations and temperature: (i) operating conditions such as initial bed height, wood feeding rate, and reactor throughput and (ii) model parameters like thermal boundary conditions, primary pyrolysis kinetics, and secondary pyrolysis model. Two different pyrolysis models are implemented and are compared against each other. The numerical results indicate (i) a relatively low influence of the investigated operating conditions on the main product gas components, (ii) a high sensitivity of main product gas components CO and CO2 on the thermal boundary condition, and (iii) a very strong influence of operating conditions and model parameters on the tar content in the product gas.},

We include particle–particle as well as particle–fluid interactions through inelastic collisions and drag forces, in a socalled four-way coupled description. These interactions are the origin for the emergence of coherent particle swarms in a flow. The dynamic cluster-formation and cluster-disintegration are associated with the competition between turbulent dispersion and inelastic particle collisions. We establish the basic scenario of this self-organization and investigate the dominant mean-flow aspects of the resulting turbulence modulation for particles with high Stokes response-time. Large-eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow, using dynamic subgrid models and particles at a significant volume fraction and realistic mass load are presented. These simulations indicate the development of a thinner boundary layer, a flatter velocity profile, an higher effective Von Ka\textasciiacute{}rma\textasciiacute{}n constant and an accumulation of particles near the walls. Moreover, it was found that neglecting particle–particle interactions, as done in so-called two-way coupling, leads to a modulated flow which displays a strong `center-channel-jet' that is not found in physical experiments.},

  abstract      = {A numerical modelling approach for the dynamic simulation of solid–liquid fluidized beds is evaluated. This approach is based on an Eulerian two-fluid formulation of the transport equations for mass, momentum and fluctuating kinetic energy. The solid-phase fluctuating motion model is derived in the frame of granular medium kinetic theory accounting for the viscous drag influence of the interstitial liquid phase. Solid–liquid fluidized bed two-dimensional simulations were performed for flow configurations taken from the experimental work of Zenit et al. [1997. Collisional particle pressure measurements in solid–liquid flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 353, 261–283], for three types of solid particles of contrasted inertia in water at high particle Reynolds number (nylon, glass and steel beads). Experimental and numerical granular pressures exhibit a satisfactory agreement with both low and high inertia particles, the best level of prediction being observed with the most inertial particles. Sensitivity of the predictions to the phenomenological laws used in the model is also presented and it appears that, due to non-linear correlations, the average granular pressure in the bed is a less sensitive variable than the fluctuating kinetic energy (or granular temperature). The transport mechanisms of the mean granular temperature in the bed are therefore analyzed as a function of the solid fraction and the particle inertia. At low and moderate Stokes number (nylon and glass beads) and in all range of solid-phase fraction, the dominant production mechanism of fluctuating kinetic energy is due to the mean velocity gradient, whereas the main dissipation term is that induced by the viscous drag. At higher Stokes number (steel beads) and concentration, the production of the granular temperature is controlled by the compressibility effects via the granular pressure. In this case, the dissipation is mainly provided by inter-particle collisions.},

On the basis of a plant-scale simulation of the CEBC process using Aspen HYSYS, preliminary economic and environmental assessments of the process are performed, both of which are benchmarked against the conventional silver-catalyzed ethylene epoxidation process. The capital costs for both processes lie within prediction uncertainty. The EO production cost for the conventional process is estimated to be 58 \textcent{}/lb EO. The CEBC process has the potential to be competitive with the conventional process if the MTO catalyst remains active, selective and stable for at least one year at a leaching rate of approximately 0.11 lb MTO/h (or 0.7 ppm Re in the reactor effluent). While CO2 emissions as byproduct are eliminated in the CEBC process, comparative cradle-to-gate life cycle assessments (LCA) reveal that the quantitative overall environmental impacts on air quality, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions are similar for both processes and lie within the uncertainties of such predictions. The LCA results point to sources outside the EO production plants as the major contributors to potential environmental impacts: natural gas-based energy required for raw material production (ethylene in both processes and hydrogen peroxide in the CEBC process) and to the significant requirements of coal-based electrical power for compressing large volumes of recycled ethylene and diluent gases in the conventional process. H2O2 production via a highly selective direct synthesis route and effective H2O2 utilization/recycle (without decomposing it) will further reduce the environmental footprint of the CEBC-EO process.},

Based on plant scale simulations, economic and environmental assessments of the CEBC-EO process were benchmarked against the conventional silver-catalyzed process.

  abstract      = {This paper presents a state of the art measurement and imaging systems used to determine the Gas Void Fraction (GVF) of two-phase flow through annuli. Several research works were conducted for GVF measurement of two and three-phase fluids flowing through full circular pipelines but only few of them targeted the annuli. The highly restricted access and the low volume within which the multiphase fluid flows through in annuli make the instrumentation design challenging. This is especially true if nonintrusive sensors are required to not disturb the flow, which is the case, for instance, if an accurate CFD modeling of annulus flow is sought out of these measurements. Motivated by the numerous industrial applications of annuli, several researchers have suggested various corresponding non-invasive GVF measurement devices to better understand the behavior of the annulus flow and also to determine the production rate. Many of these techniques are based on electrical conductivity measurements using one or several pairs of electrodes. Various configurations of the electrodes were suggested and this paper highlights that none of them can cope with all kinds of flow patterns. Imaging techniques using wire mesh and electrical resistance tomography were also suggested and the initial corresponding results were very encouraging. This paper provides a critical review of each of these techniques and highlights the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of each one. Hence, it can be a valuable research reference for either new scientists in the area of instrumentation to design a sensor targeting annulus flow or to experienced engineers and researchers to keep in touch with the most recent research advances in the area.},

The mixing efficiency of ethanol into water is analyzed for diffusion dominated flows. Apart from parametric variations, the Dean flow analysis at different locations of the channels showed higher capability of the curvature induced geometries. The aspect of layer mixing is also examined by the strength of the expansion or contraction along the flow path, which signifies the effect of curvature upon the extent of mixing. Mixing efficiency as high as 94\% has been achieved for the elliptical type of micromixer. Additionally, the influence of curvature toward the gradual increase and enhancement of mixing has been demonstrated with the gradual increase of the area of contact available in the split and recombine sections.},

This work develops an equation-oriented (EO) multiscale modeling framework using the open-source IDAES-PSE platform that tractably incorporates microkinetic detail in process design via reduced-order kinetic (ROK) models. Using multiobjective optimization with embedded heat integration and life-cycle analysis, we simultaneously minimize the minimum selling price of liquid hydrocarbons (e.g., liquid fuels/additives from shale gas) and process emissions (via a CO2 tax). Optimization reduces greenhouse gas emissions per MJ of fuel produced by over 35\% compared to the literature and achieves a carbon efficiency of 87\%. The optimizer changes the recycling rate, temperatures, and pressures to mitigate the effect of ROK model-form uncertainty on product portfolio predictions. Moreover, we show that the optimal process design is insensitive to changing CO2 tax rates. Finally, the EO framework enables a fast sensitivity analysis of shale gas composition variability across 12 regions of the Eagle Ford basin. These results highlight the benefits of the open-source EO framework: fast, scalable, customized, and reproducible system analysis and optimization for sustainable energy technologies beyond shale utilization.}

Ammonia can be used as an energy vector for an emissionless energy cycle in a variety of ways. Ammonia at the point of end use can be converted to hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles or alternatively utilized directly in solid oxide fuel cells, in an internal combustion engine or a gas turbine. One ton of ammonia production requires 9–15 MWh of energy. However, its conversion back to useful form or direct utilization can lead to substantial energy losses. In this paper, we present an overview of the current processes and technologies for ammonia synthesis and its utilization as an energy carrier. We have performed an estimation of the round-trip efficiency of different routes for ammonia utilization at the point of end use along with some sensitivity analysis, and we discuss the outcomes resulting from the best and worst case scenarios.},

Student experiences with the linear learning pathway were compared with a previously implemented non-linear learning pathway. In the linear pathway, students complete the virtual laboratory tour in a predetermined order, while in a non-linear pathway the students can complete the virtual laboratory tour in any order. Student feedback was collected from over 900 students and the experiences from the linearly structured virtual laboratory were highly positive. Compared to the previously implemented non-linear learning pathway, the student feedback related to the learning experience improved significantly. The feedback also showed a difference between preferred learning styles, highlighting the importance of choosing the learning pathway based on the intended learning outcomes and offering different types of learning materials for different learners. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the linearly structured virtual laboratory offers an effective and motivating learning environment for laboratory safety training.},

  abstract      = {The present work represents the first study focused on controlled hydrodynamic cavitation applied as gas transfer system to supply the methanogenic archaea with exogenous H2 and CO2. Starting from a generic mixed inoculum sampled from a thermophilic full-scale anaerobic digester, a bubble column bioreactor was coupled with a rotating hydrodynamic cavitator and fed with different H2/CO2 loading rates. Process efficiency and long-term effects on process stability and microbial population were evaluated. Gas sparging through the controlled hydrodynamic cavitation device is feasible under the operating conditions tested, resulting in almost 100\% efficiency in H2 utilization and recording a CH4 volumetric content more than 99\% in the gas leaving the reactor, without any gas recirculation from the headspace. The experimental trials lasted about 160~days and the behavior of the bioreactor showed a substantial stability over the time. Metagenomic and FISH analyses were carried out at the end of the experimental trials, revealing a remarkable increase of hydrogenotrophic methanogens species, related to the selection-effect of H2 on community composition. The findings provide previously unidentified insights into long-term effect on process stability and microbial community diversity in the biological hydrogenotrophic methanation process coupled with a gas–liquid mass transfer system based on controlled hydrodynamic cavitation technology.},

At high Reynolds numbers, corresponding to a particle diameter of about 2 mm at ambient air conditions, viscous effects can be neglected.

  abstract      = {Simplifications to the full set of scaling parameters for dynamic similarity of fluidized beds, Glicksman, Chemical Engineering Science, 39 (1984) 373, were explored. A new set of simplified scaling laws includes the Froude number based on column height, the solid to gas density ratio, the ratio of superficial to minimum fluidization velocity, bed geometric ratios, and particle sphericity and size distribution. When the gas to particle drag is represented by either the Ergun equation or a single particle drag equation, the new simplified laws hold exactly in both the viscous dominated and gas inertia dominated limits. For intermediate conditions, the gas to particle drag is well approximated in models based on the simplified scaling laws. The simplified scaling laws allow very small models to be constructed which properly simulate the hydrodynamics of a full size reactor or combustor. Experimental confirmation of the new simplified scaling laws and the viscous limit scaling parameters, where equality of the density ratio is omitted, were carried out in circulating fluidized beds. Within the viscous limit, the solid to gas density ratio is an important modeling parameter when the slugging regime is approached. In general, the solid to gas density must be matched to achieve good similarity. Using the new simplified scaling laws, good agreement was observed even when the length scale of the air fluidized model was as small as l/16 that of an atmospheric combustor.},

However, the circulating of bed material through the furnace, cyclone and loop-seal in an oxy-fuel circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor may trigger the particle size changes as a result of rapid collisions among particles and friction with the inner refractory wall. Rather than considering only the effect of initial particle size, it is significantly important to emphasize on the change in limestone particle size due to in-reactor attrition. In addition, the changes are further enhanced with calcination reaction that occurred under high-temperature conditions. Herein an investigative account of limestone in a lab-scale CFB process was presented by using two types of fluidizing media (Air, CO2) to determine its attrition and morphological changes under simulated operating conditions for riser and loop-seal. A significant difference in attrition index was observed as calcination of limestone occurred at high temperature under air atmosphere which was not observed under CO2 condition. With similar cross-sectional area observed for both the tested (CO2 condition) and re-carbonated limestone, it was concluded that re-carbonation of calcined lime at high CO2 concentration in the loop-seal resulted in a comparable abrasion resistance that further improved desulfurization performance by reducing the amount of ultra-fine particles generated from limestone.},

In this work, we have computationally investigated the influence of key design parameters such as the aspect ratio of the vortex chamber, the number of tangential inlets and the shape of the device on resulting flow characteristics and cavitation. Experiments were carried out to validate key findings from the computational studies. These investigations revealed that the aspect ratio of the vortex chamber as six may be considered as optimum. The performance of single and multiple inlet devices was found to be comparable at the same pressure drop (that is at same energy consumption per m3). Scale-up with a geometric similarity led to a reduction in the extent of cavitation for same energy consumption per m3. For facilitating scale-out option, an attempt was made to simplify the configuration of the vortex-based cavitation device. Computational results indicated that the cavitation performance of simplified configuration was not significantly inferior. A case of the formation of liquid–liquid emulsion was taken as a test case for evaluation of a modified cavitation device based on the present investigations. The droplet size distributions of emulsions generated by both the devices indicate that the proposed simplified configuration, which may facilitate fabrication and offer integrated scale-out options, performs almost at par with a complex configuration. The presented results will be useful for optimising designs of vortex-based hydrodynamic cavitation devices/ reactors.},

There is an increasing need for developing equipment and devices for producing emulsions with desired drop size distribution (DSD) in a continuous mode of operation to fulfil market demands. In this work, we experimentally investigated droplet size distributions of emulsions made using selected cavitation-based emulsion producing devices operated in a continuous mode. Emulsion production devices considered in this work are wet mill, Soldo cavitator, Dynaflow cavitator and different scales of vortex based hydrodynamic cavitation devices. The continuous emulsion production experiments were performed for generating 5 \% rapeseed oil-in-water emulsions using different devices. Performance of different emulsion production devices based on energy efficiency of emulsification (\ensuremath{\eta}), energy consumption per kilogram of emulsion (E), interfacial area created per unit energy consumption (Anet)P, Sauter mean diameter (d32), other characteristic diameters (D10, D50, D90), and drop size distribution (DSD) was compared. Among all the devices, vortex based hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) devices showed excellent performance in terms of lower d32 and DSD with low E and high \ensuremath{\eta}. The smallest scale of vortex-based HC device exhibited the highest efficiency (\textasciitilde 0.16 \% at E = 2.6 kJ/kg) over the entire range of E compared to the other devices considered in this study. The presented data and analysis will be useful for selection of emulsion producing devices for desired emulsion characteristics and production capacity.},

The economics of this process are compared with the direct oxidation of propane to acrylic acid in a fixed bed, turbulent fluidized bed (TFB) and circulating fluidized bed (CFB). Economies of scale are difficult to realize in fixed beds due to the limited heat transfer surface, and therefore, several reactors are required in parallel. A single reactor train is possible due to the excellent heat transfer characteristics of the TFB and CFB. The economics of the TFB are superior to either the CFB or multi-tubular fixed beds. However, both investment and operating costs are sensitive to selectivity. A CFB could become the reactor of choice if lattice oxygen can be shown to improve selectivity and conversion. In order for propane to replace propylene as the preferred feedstock, selectivity must be at least 65 \%, which has yet to be demonstrated in practice.},

  abstract      = {A novel technique to sample particle velocity distributions and collision characteristics from dynamic discrete particle simulations of intrinsically unsteady, non-homogeneous systems, such as those encountered in dense gas- uidised beds, is presented. The results are compared to the isotropic Maxwellian particle velocity distribution and the impact velocity distribution that constitute the zeroth-order Enskog approximation for the kinetic theory of granular ow. Excellent agreement with the kinetic theory is obtained for elastic particles. The individual particle velocity distribution function is isotropic and Maxwellian. A good \"{y}t of the collision velocity distribution and frequency is obtained, using the radial distribution function proposed by Carnahan and Starling (J. Chem. Phys. 51 (1969) 635). However, for inelastic and rough particles an anisotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution is obtained. It is concluded that the formation of dense particle clusters disturbs spatial homogeneity and results in collisional anisotropy. Analysis of the impact velocity shows that, in dense gas- uidised beds, not all impact angles are of equal likelihood. The observed anisotropy becomes more pronounced with increasing degree of inelasticity of the particles. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {A critical comparison of a hard-sphere discrete particle model, a two-fluid model with kinetic theory closure equations and experiments performed in a pseudo-two-dimensional gas-fluidised bed is made. Bubble patterns, time-averaged particle distributions and bed expansion dynamics measured with a nonintrusive digital image analysis technique are compared to simulation results obtained at three different fluidisation velocities. For both CFD models, the simulated flow fields and granular temperature profiles are compared. The effects of grid refinement, particle – wall interaction, long-term particle contacts, particle rotation and gas – particle drag are studied. The mechanical energy balance for the suspended particles is introduced, and the energy household for both CFD models is compared. The most critical comparison between experiments and model results is given by analysis of the bed expansion dynamics. Though both models predict the right fluidisation regime and trends in bubble sizes and bed expansion, the predicted bed expansion dynamics differ significantly from the experimental results. Alternative gas – particle drag models result in significantly different bed dynamics, but the gap between model and experimental results cannot be closed. In comparison with the experimental results, the discrete particle model gives superior resemblance. The main difference between both CFD models is caused by the neglect of particle rotation in the kinetic theory closure equations embedded in the two-fluid model. Energy balance analysis demonstrates that over 80\% of the total energy is dissipated by sliding friction. Introduction of an effective restitution coefficient that incorporates the additional dissipation due to frictional interactions significantly improves the agreement between both models.},

  abstract      = {Cavitation refers to the formation and collapse of vapor bubbles near solid boundaries in high-speed flows, such as ship propellers and pumps. During this process, cavitation bubbles focus fluid energy on the solid surface by forming high-speed jets, leading to damage and downtime of machinery. In response, numerous surface treatments to counteract this effect have been explored, including perfluorinated coatings and surface hardening, but they all succumb to cavitation erosion eventually. Here, we report on biomimetic gas-entrapping microtextured surfaces (GEMS) that robustly entrap air when immersed in water regardless of the wetting nature of the substrate. Crucially, the entrapment of air inside the cavities repels cavitation bubbles away from the surface, thereby preventing cavitation damage. We provide mechanistic insights by treating the system as a potential flow problem of a multi-bubble system. Our findings present a possible avenue for mitigating cavitation erosion through the application of inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials.},

However, the challenge is that many particular chemical reactions may require dedicated tuned photoreactors to achieve maximal efficiency. This is a critical stumbling block unless the possibility for reactor design becomes available directly in the laboratories. In this work, customized laboratory photoreactors were developed with temperature stabilization and the ability to adapt different LED light sources of various wavelengths. We explore two important concepts for the design of photoreactors: reactors for performing multiple parallel experiments and reactors suitable for scale-up synthesis, allowing a rapid increase in the product amount. Reactors of the first type were efficiently made of metal using metal laser sintering, and reactors of the second type were successfully manufactured from plastic using fused filament fabrication. Practical evaluation has shown good accuracy of the temperature stabilization in the range typically required for organic synthesis for both types of reactors. Synthetic application of 3D printed reactors has shown good utility in test reactions--furan C–H arylation and thiol-yne coupling. The critical effect of temperature stabilization was established for the furan arylation reaction: heating of the reaction mixture may lead to the total vanishing of photochemical effect.},

The second part is devoted to phenomenological models of primary atomization. Because earlier conventional models of breakup are well reported in the available literature, we highlight only two recent developments: (a) stochastic simulation of the liquid jet depletion in the framework of fragmentation under scaling symmetry and (b) primary atomization in terms of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) mixing with a strong variation of density.},

When the bubble collapses near the surface, violent fluid jets may be generated. Understanding whether these jets occur and predicting their directions -- departing or approaching the solid surface -- is crucial for assessing their potential impact on the solid phase. However, the criteria for classifying the onset and directions of the jets created by cavitation near a curved surface of a cylinder have not been established. In this research, we present models to predict the occurrence and directions of the jet in such scenarios. The onset criteria and the direction(s) of the jets are dictated by the bubble stand-off distance and the cylinder diameter. Our models are validated by comprehensive experiments. The results not only predict the jetting behaviour but can serve as guidelines for designing and controlling the jets when a cavitation bubble collapses near a cylinder, whether for protective or destructive purposes.},

Jet pumps readily induce cavitation owing to their tapering section structure and thus have the potential to be used as jet cavitation reactors (JCRs) to achieve hydrodynamic cavitation and algal removal under suitable pressure conditions. In this paper, we examine the cavitation characteristics of a JCR at different working fluid temperatures, using large eddy simulation. The vortex structure created by high-speed jets at the nozzle of the JCR is continuous and orderly, whereas the downstream vortex structure becomes chaotic and fragmented under the actions of flow mixing and bubble development. An increase in water temperature can reduce vorticity. As the water temperature rises, the cavitation number decreases, the total cavity volume increases, and cavitation changes from an unstable to a stable limit state. When cavitation is in its unstable limit state, the total bubble volume exhibits quasi-periodic changes and the cavitation cloud pulsates strongly, while when cavitation is in its stable limit state, cavitation cloud pulsation is seen only at the outlet.},

The wide size distribution usually gave the highest reactor efficiency, while the narrow blend gave the lowest. The differences are not solely a function of the '\textasteriskcenteredfines content". The reasons for the influence of particle size distribution were examined by testing the "bimodal" distribution with different fractions active. In the bubbling fluidisatfon regime and for Group A particles, this influence can be predicted using the 'Rro-Phase Bubbling Bed Reactor Model with modifications to allow for increased concentration of fine particles in the dilute phase.},

  abstract      = {Although they account for most of the important applications of gas–solid fluidization, the turbulent fluidization and dense suspension upflow \v{Z}DSU. regimes have received far less attention than less important gas–solid flow regimes like bubbling and fast fluidization. This has arisen for various historical and practical reasons, but it is important that the balance now be redressed. The term turbulent fluidization covers two different types of transitional behaviour for voidages of approximately 0.65 to 0.8, one following a relatively sharp breakdown of bubbling and the other involving intermittency. The DSU regime has only recently been identified as being distinct from turbulent and fast fluidization, even though it has been applied extensively in fluid catalytic cracking for many years. Early approaches to the study and modelling of these two flow regimes tend to be empirical or oversimplified. More promising approaches are now under development based on a statistical probability approach, dissipative structures and computational fluid dynamics \v{Z}CFD.. The difficulties and prospects are discussed in this paper. Such features as turbulence, energy dissipation, intermittency, chaos and computational modelling need to be studied to improve the mechanistic understanding of these flow regimes. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

  abstract      = {Claims and suggestions in the literature that verification or validation of CFD numerical models has been achieved for fluidized beds are shown to be inconsistent with objective criteria and accepted usage of terminology. Verification involves confirming the accuracy of the computational aspect of the model, for example by comparing results against known solutions, something that is virtually impossible in dense multiphase systems, except for trivial cases. Validation requires objective consideration of computational and numerical error, as well as comparison of model predictions and experimental data over broad ranges of conditions. More care is required in applying these terms, and in planning and conducting experiments to test the validity of fluidized bed numerical codes. Similar considerations apply to experimental attempts to confirm the completeness of sets of matched dimensionless groups used for dynamic scaling of multiphase systems.},

Besides simpler cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, phenomena addressed by these techniques include precursor assisted nucleation, nucleation in eutectic and phase separating systems, phase selection via competing nucleation processes, growth front nucleation (a process, in which grains of new orientations form at the solidification front) yielding crystal sheaves and spherulites, and transition between the growth controlled cellular and the nucleation dominated equiaxial solidification morphologies.},

To determine data of solids concentration with high spatial resolution an X-ray computer tomography system is used. This system mainly consists of a 60 keV X-ray source and an X-ray linear detector with 1024 sensitive elements, which gives eight bit-values representing integral solids concentrations between the X-ray source and the detector. A number of experiments have been carried out both at the upflow and at the downflow of two different circulating fluidized beds containing glass beads of 70 ␮m at superficial gas velocities from 2 to 7 m/s. Results show that the X-ray computer tomography system is applicable to average solids concentrations from 1 up to 20 vol\% of solids concentration in a tube with 0.19 m inner diameter. \textcopyright{}2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Its feasibility has been demonstrated in numerous pilot campaigns, including tests validating advanced features such as indirectly heating the sorbent regenerator. However, some issues, such as the role of reactor hydrodynamics, need to be discussed more thoroughly to reliably scale up CaL plants for commercial operation. In this work, we present a novel carbonator model based on a systematic literature review and experimental data from pilot tests, including a rigorous analysis of carbonator fluidization regimes. We highlight that modeling assumptions commonly found in the literature can result in a significant overestimation of carbonator performance. Additionally, we offer guidelines for the appropriate selection of these assumptions. Our carbonator model provides an effective tool for the next scale-up step of CaL technology.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the viscosity reduction of whey protein concentrate as result of hydrodynamic cavitation. A whey protein concentrate (31\% dry matter) was subjected to different hydrodynamic cavitation treatments and the viscosity was monitored during 14 days of storage, denaturation enthalpy was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and particle size by dynamic light scattering. Results showed that hydrodynamic cavitation treatment decreased viscosity by 7–8\%, and this effect remained constant during the 14 days of storage. Based on the analysis of particle size distribution, the viscosity reduction was suggested to be linked to a reduction in the presence of large particles, possibly due to disruption of aggregates.},

A model has been developed and validated against experimental data obtained from a 0.1 m id, 6 m high CFB using a group B powder. The equations proposed by, Jones and Davidson [D.R.M. Jones, J.F.

The solid circulation loop has been divided into many sections, where the pressure drop was calculated independently: riser, cyclone, standpipe, control device and return duct. A new theoretical model, that is able to predict the pressure losses in the return path of the solid from the standpipe to the riser, has been built. A new correlation for cyclone pressure loss with very high solid loads has been found on the basis of experimental data. The pressure loss in the riser has been calculated by imposing the closure of the pressure balance, P = 0. Once the riser pressure drop had been calculated, the holdup distribution along the riser was obtained by imposing a particular shape of the profile, according to the different fluid-dynamics regimes (fast fluidization or pneumatic transport). In the first case, an exponential decay was imposed and the bottom holdup was adjusted to fit the total pressure drop, in the second case, the height of the dense zone was instead varied.},

  abstract      = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in the mathematical modelling of many processes and systems in physical, biological and other sciences. To simulate such processes and systems, the solutions of PDEs often need to be approximated numerically. The finite element method, for instance, is a usual standard methodology to do so. The recent success of deep neural networks at various approximation tasks has motivated their use in the numerical solution of PDEs. These so-called physics-informed neural networks and their variants have shown to be able to successfully approximate a large range of PDEs. So far, physics-informed neural networks and the finite element method have mainly been studied in isolation of each other. In this work, we compare the methodologies in a systematic computational study. Indeed, we employ both methods to numerically solve various linear and nonlinear PDEs: Poisson in 1D, 2D and 3D, Allen–Cahn in 1D, semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger in 1D and 2D. We then compare computational costs and approximation accuracies. In terms of solution time and accuracy, physics-informed neural networks have not been able to outperform the finite element method in our study. In some experiments, they were faster at evaluating the solved PDE.},

  abstract      = {Counterfeit or substandard medicines adversely affect the health of millions of people and cost an estimated \$200 billion USD annually. Their burden is greatest in developing countries, where the World Health Organization estimates that one in ten medical products are fake. In this work, I describe a simple addition to the existing drug manufacturing process that imparts an edible universally unique physical identifier to each pill, tablet, capsule, caplet, etc. This technique uses nonpareils (also called sprinkles and “hundreds and thousands”), tiny inexpensive multicolor candy spheres that are normally added to other candies or desserts as decorations. If nonpareils are applied at random to a pill immediately after manufacture, the specific pattern they form is unlikely to ever be repeated by random chance; this means that the pattern (or “CandyCode”) can be used to uniquely identify the pill and distinguish it from all other pills. By taking a photograph of each CandyCoded pill after manufacture and recording the location and color of each nonpareil, a manufacturer can construct a database containing the CandyCodes of all known-authentic pills they produce. A consumer can then simply use a cellphone to photograph a pill and transfer its image to the manufacturer’s server, which determines whether the pill’s CandyCode matches a known-good CandyCode in their database (meaning that the pill is authentic) or does not have a match in the database (in which case the consumer is warned that the pill may be counterfeit and should not be consumed). To demonstrate the feasibility of using random particles as universal identifiers, I performed a series of experiments using both real CandyCodes (on commercially produced chocolate candies) and simulated CandyCodes (generated by software). I also developed a simple method for converting a CandyCode photo to a set of strings for convenient storage and retrieval in a database. Even after subjecting CandyCodes to rough handling to simulate shipping conditions, the CandyCodes were still easily verifiable using a cellphone camera. A manufacturer could produce at least \$\$10\textasciicircum\{17\}\$\$CandyCoded pills--41 million for each person on Earth--and still be able to uniquely identify each CandyCode. By providing universally-unique IDs that are easy to manufacture but hard to counterfeit, require no alteration of the existing drug formulation and minimal alteration of the manufacturing process, and need only a cameraphone for verification, CandyCodes could play an important role in the fight against fraud in pharmaceuticals and many other products.},

  abstract      = {We demonstrate how incorporating physics constraints into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enables learning subgrid-scale (SGS) closures for stable and accurate large-eddy simulations (LES) in the small-data regime (i.e., when the availability of high-quality training data is limited). Using several setups of forced 2D turbulence as the testbeds, we examine the a priori and a posteriori performance of three methods for incorporating physics: (1) data augmentation (DA), (2) CNN with group convolutions (GCNN), and (3) loss functions that enforce a global enstrophy-transfer conservation (EnsCon). While the data-driven closures from physics-agnostic CNNs trained in the big-data regime are accurate and stable, and outperform dynamic Smagorinsky (DSMAG) closures, their performances substantially deteriorate when these CNNs are trained with 40x fewer samples (the small-data regime). An example based on a vortex dipole demonstrates that the physics-agnostic CNN cannot account for never-seen-before samples' rotational equivariance (symmetry), an important property of the SGS term. This shows a major shortcoming of the physics-agnostic CNN in the small-data regime. We show that CNN with DA and GCNN address this issue and each produce accurate and stable data-driven closures in the small-data regime. Despite its simplicity, DA, which adds appropriately rotated samples to the training set, performs as well or in some cases even better than GCNN, which uses a sophisticated equivariance-preserving architecture. EnsCon, which combines structural modeling with aspect of functional modeling, also produces accurate and stable closures in the small-data regime. Overall, GCNN+EnsCon, which combines these two physics constraints, shows the best a posteriori performance in this regime. These results illustrate the power of physics-constrained learning in the small-data regime for accurate and stable LES.},

  abstract      = {The application of forward light scattering methods for estimating the particle size distribution (PSD) is usually limited by the occurrence of multiple scattering, which affects the angular distribution of light in highly concentrated suspensions, thus resulting in false calculations by the conventionally adopted algorithms. In this paper, a previously proposed neural network-based method is tested with different particle systems, in order to evaluate its applicability. In the first step of the study, experiments were carried out with solid – liquid suspensions having different characteristics of particle shape and size distribution, under varying solid concentrations. The experimental results, consisting of the angular distribution of light intensity, particle shape and suspension concentration, were used as input data in the fitting of neural network models (NN) that replaced the optical model to provide the PSD. The reference values of particle shape and PSD for the NN fitting were based on image analysis. Comparisons between the PSD values computed by the NN model and the reference values indicate that the method can be used in monitoring the PSD of particles with different shapes in highly concentrated suspensions, thus extending the range of application of forward laser diffraction to a number of systems with industrial interest.

  abstract      = {In accordance with the changes in the free energies of formation of hydrocarbons as a function of temperature, methane is unstable in terms of its elements from 530\textdegree{}C, but remains the most stable of hydrocarbons up to 1030\textdegree{}C. Using methane, it is necessary to reach temperatures of 1200 and 1300\textdegree{}C to produce, respectively, acetylene and ethylene. However, since acetylene becomes the most stable hydrocarbon from 1230\textdegree{}C, it is acetylene that predominates at this temperature. According to the variation in the enthalpies of formation as a function of temperature, the pyrolysis of methane demands a very high energy input to form primarily acetylene. We calculated the composition of a mixture CH4, C2H4, C2H2, C6H6 and H2 at thermodynamic equilibrium by minimizing the Gibbs energy of this system. This method does not require prior knowledge of the chemical reactions taking place at equilibrium. The calculation parameters are the initial HC ratio, the temperature, the pressure and the Gibbs energies of each substance. The analysis of the complex chemical equilibria helps to identify temperature zones corresponding to stability domains of certain molecules. Below 1200\textdegree{}C, the disappearance of methane is slight, and the main hydrocarbon produced is benzene, followed by ethylene, without any significant formation of acetylene. Species with acetylenic structures (like C2H2) appear above 1200\textdegree{}C, as well as C2H, C3H and radicals such as H and CH3. This means that the CC and CH bonds split above 1200\textdegree{}C. The species present have an increasingly small HC ratio, and the initial hydrogen is found virtually in molecular form. The presence of hydrogen in the reaction medium has the effect of increasing the proportion of the hydrogen-rich species, chiefly CH4 and C2H4, and of decreasing the conversion of methane.},

  abstract      = {Packed bed reactors (PBRs) are extensively used in chemical process industries to perform solid-catalyzed gas–liquid reactions. Their performance is significantly influenced by liquid distribution which is a strong function of particle shape and size. In the present work, we simulated the steady-state local liquid distribution, pressure drop (\ensuremath{\Delta}P/L), and overall liquid holdup (〈\ensuremath{\epsilon}L〉) for the beds packed with spherical and cylindrical particles using a three-dimensional (3D) Eulerian multifluid model and validated the predictions using corresponding high-speed imaging measurements performed in pseudo-2D packed beds. We showed that the Eulerian model with existing closures significantly underpredicts the liquid distribution for the bed randomly packed with cylindrical particles. To address this, we proposed a modification in existing mechanical dispersion force (F\rightarrow{}D) model as a function of average particle orientation angle (\texttheta{}). The modification significantly improved agreement between the predictions and the corresponding measurements. Using the modified model, we showed that the increased magnitude of F\rightarrow{}D in the lateral direction leads to higher lateral liquid spreading for cylindrical particles as compared to that for the spherical particles. Importantly, the modified model also predicted the local liquid distribution and \ensuremath{\Delta}P/L for beds packed manually with cylindrical particles oriented at different \texttheta{} in a satisfactory agreement with the corresponding measurements. On increasing \texttheta{}, the F\rightarrow{}D in lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to flow) as well as liquid–solid interaction force (F\rightarrow{}LS) in axial direction (i.e., parallel to flow) found to increase significantly. As a result, the lateral liquid spreading as well as \ensuremath{\Delta}P/L decrease substantially on increasing \texttheta{}.},

  abstract      = {Hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in defining the performance of circulating fluidized beds (CFB). The numerical simulation of CFBs is very important in the prediction of its flow behavior. From this point of view, in the present study a dynamic two dimensional model is developed considering the hydrodynamic behavior of CFB. In the modeling, the CFB riser is analyzed in two regions: The bottom zone in turbulent fluidization regime is modeled in detail as two-phase flow which is subdivided into a solid-free bubble phase and a solid-laden emulsion phase. In the upper zone core–annulus solids flow structure is established. Simulation model takes into account the axial and radial distribution of voidage, velocity and pressure drop for gas and solid phase, and solids volume fraction and particle size distribution for solid phase. The model results are compared with and validated against atmospheric cold bed CFB units' experimental data given in the literature for axial and radial distribution of void fraction, solids volume fraction and particle velocity, total pressure drop along the bed height and radial solids flux. Ranges of experimental data used in comparisons are as follows: bed diameter from 0.05–0.418 m, bed height from 5–18 m, mean particle diameter from 67–520 \ensuremath{\mu}m, particle density from 1398 to 2620 kg/m3, mass fluxes from 21.3 to 300 kg/m2s and gas superficial velocities from 2.52–9.1 m/s.},

  abstract      = {The numerical simulation of CFBs is an important tool in the prediction of its flow behavior. Predicting the axial pressure profile is one of the major difficulties in modeling a CFB. A model using a Particle Based Approach (PBA) is developed to accurately predict the axial pressure profile in CFBs. The simulation model accounts for the axial and radial distribution of voidage and velocity of the gas and solid phases, and for the solids volume fraction and particle size distribution of the solid phase. The model results are compared with and validated against atmospheric cold CFB experimental literature data. Ranges of experimental data used in comparisons are as follows: bed diameter from 0.05 to 0.305 m, bed height between 5 and 15.45 m, mean particle diameter from 76 to 812 ␮m, particle density from 189 to 2600 kg/m3, solid circulation fluxes from 10.03 to 489 kg/m2 s and gas superficial velocities from 2.71 to 10.68 m/s. The computational results agreed reasonably well with the experimental data. Moreover, both experimental data and model predictions show that the pressure drop profile is affected by the solid circulation flux and superficial velocity values in the riser. The pressure drop increases along the acceleration region as solid circulation flux increases and superficial velocity decreases.},

Hydrodynamic model used in this study has been developed in our previous studies. Simulation model calculates the axial and radial distribution of voidage, velocity, particle size distribution, pressure drop, gas emissions and temperature at each time interval for gas and solid phase both for dense bed and for riser. The model has been validated against the data from a pilot-scale 50 kW CFB combustor and an industrial-scale 160 MW CFB combustor. A sensitivity analysis is carried out using the model to examine the effect of different operational parameters and coal properties on bed temperature and the overall CO, NOx and SO2 emissions from the combustor. As a result of parametric study, it is observed that by increasing bed operational velocity or excess air ratio, bed temperature decreases and CO emission increases. Bed operational velocity has a more significant effect on CO emission than to bed temperature. Another effect of increasing excess air is the decrease of SO2 and NOx emissions. However, NOx emission increases with the operational bed velocity while SO2 emission decreases.},

Based on a previously developed 2D CFB model, a modified cluster renewal model is used in this investigation. The model uses the particle-based approach (PBA) and integrates the hydrodynamics and combustion aspects. The study is also validated with experimental data. As a result of this study, it is observed that the bed-to-wall heat transfer coefficients are strongly dependent on particle diameter and solids concentration at the riser wall. The smaller particles result in higher heat transfer coefficients than larger particles for the same solids volume fraction values. The heat transfer coefficient increases with suspension density. However, at a constant suspension density, the superficial velocity does not have a significant influence on the heat transfer coefficient. PBA is satisfactorily adapted to cluster renewal model so that to define the bed-to-wall heat transfer mechanisms for the upper zone.},

In the modeling, the CFB combustor is analyzed in two regions: bottom zone considering as a bubbling fluidized bed in turbulent fluidization regime and upper zone core-annulus solids flow structure is established. In the bottom zone, a single-phase back-flow cell model is used to represent the solid mixing. Solids exchange, between the bubble phase and emulsion phase is a function of the bubble diameter and varies along the axis of the combustor. In the upper zone, particles move upward in the core and downward in the annulus. Thickness of the annulus varies according to the combustor height. Using the developed simulation program, the effects of operational parameters which are the particle diameter, superficial velocity and air-to-fuel ratio on net solids flux, oxygen and carbon dioxide mole ratios along the bed height and carbon content and bed temperature on the top of the riser are investigated. Simulation results are compared with test results obtained from the 50 kW Gazi University Heat Power Laboratory pilot scale unit and good agreement is observed.},

Furthermore, solids volume concentration at high-pressure drop of a bubble cap is lower than that at low-pressure drop of a bubble cap at all lateral positions. The pressure drop of the distributor has little influence on the profiles of solids volume concentrations and on the profiles of solids velocities in CFB upper dilute region.

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are widely employed for investigating dense gas–solid flows. However, conducting numerical simulations covering varying geometries and operating conditions is prohibitively expensive. In recent years, neural network-based methods have shown immense potential for accelerating flow field simulation. Still, forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of gas–solid flow fields remains an open challenge for surrogate models. This study presents a physics-encoded neural network model to predict gas–solid dynamics in bubbling fluidized beds with different geometry sizes. With a novel module to estimate the particle migration distribution, the model overcomes the limitation present in pure data-driven approaches and intrinsically ensures the conservation of solid mass in the system. Additionally, it not only utilizes grid-scale information but also learns particle-scale details, thereby enhancing the forecasting performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, the physics-encoded model demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy of predicting instantaneous distributions, time-averaged and fluctuating fields, as well as bubble characteristics, in comparison to traditional data-driven models. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robust generalization capabilities, enabling it to handle previously unseen conditions with varied particle number. In contrast, data-driven models tend to memorize flow patterns seen during training, resulting in drastic deviations. In summary, the proposed method offers for a thousand-fold speedup and provides reasonable predictions for gas–solid systems with varying geometrical dimensions.},

Existing hydrodynamic models fail to properly and reliably describe the flow characteristics typical of CFB catalytic reactors operating at high superficial gas velocities and solids mass fluxes. In the present work, we have compiled an extensive experimental database to encompass published laboratory, pilot, and available industrial scale hydrodynamic data in a concise and useable form. Thorough analysis of the database followed by an in-depth multiple regression analysis yielded a new correlation for calculating the ``slip factor'', defined as the ratio of the interstitial gas velocity to the particle velocity, to describe Geldart Group A powder systems in the fully developed flow \v{Z}FDF. region of the riser. The correlation allows the evaluation of the gas–solid suspension density in the riser in both the fast fluidization \v{Z}FF. and pneumatic transport \v{Z}PTR. flow regimes. In addition, a comparative study has been carried out on the database to investigate the effects of the geometrical configuration of the top exit of the riser on the suspension density and flow structure. Two reflection coefficient correlations are proposed to account for exit effects for both Groups A and B solids systems. The slip factor and reflection coefficient correlations have been further compared to existing correlations available in the literature for discussion and validation and shown to successfully characterize the large majority of data available in the literature. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

The correlation proposed for the kinetic parameters' estimation contains four parameters that depend on the feed characteristics, catalyst activity, and coke forming tendency of the feed. This approach eliminates the need of determining a large number of rate constants required for conventional lumped models. The model seems to be more versatile than existing models and opens up a new dimension for making generic models suitable for the analysis and control studies of FCC units.

  abstract      = {Evaporation is a unit operation that separates a liquid from solids by means of heat transfer via vaporization or boiling. The purpose of evaporation is to concentrate a solution of a nonvolatile solute (i.e., solids) and a solvent (i.e., liquid), which is typically water. Evaporating a portion of the solvent concentrates the solute into a more-viscous liquid product. Evaporation is regularly used in the food processing, chemical, kraft paper, and pharmaceutical industries to produce liquid concentrates. Evaporation differs from distillation in that the concentrated solution, rather than the condensed evaporate, is typically the valuable product. A common exception is the evaporation of solutions with a high mineral content, where the vapor is condensed as the product and the concentrated brine is discarded. This process is commonly referred to as water distillation, although the process is more akin to a thermally driven Liquid-solids separation operation.},

  abstract      = {Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion systems are increasingly used as superior coal burning systems in power generation due to their higher efficiency and lower emissions. However, because of their non-linearity and complex behavior, it is difficult to build a comprehensive model that incorporates all the system dynamics. In this paper, a mathematical model of the circulating fluidized bed combustion system based on mass and energy conservation equations was successfully extracted. Using these correlations, a state space dynamical model oriented to bed temperature has been obtained based on subspace method. Bed temperature, which influences boiler overall efficiency and the rate of pollutants emission, is one of the most significant parameters in the operation of these types of systems. Having dynamic and parametric uncertainties in the model, a robust control algorithm based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) have been applied to control the bed temperature by input parameters, i.e. coal feed rate and fluidization velocity. The controller proposed properly sets the temperature to our desired range with a minimum tracking error and minimizes the sensitivity of the closed-loop system to disturbances caused by uncertainties such as change in feeding coal, while the settling time of the system is significantly decreased.},

Two particle sizes of 70 and 200 lm are considered in the present work. For the 70 lm particles, the presence of the particles dampens the gas-phase turbulence intensity at the lowest value of Re investigated (8300) compared with the single-phase flow at the same Re. As Re increases, the gas turbulence increases, and for Re {\$>\$} 13,800 the gas turbulence is enhanced compared with the single-phase flow at the same Re. For the 200 lm particles, the intensity also increases with Re and is enhanced for all values of Re investigated, except at the lowest value of Re investigated (6400). At this value, the gas turbulence is equal to that of single-phase flow at the same Re. The observed trend in the gas-phase turbulence modulation with Re is proposed to be due to the change in the segregation patterns and in the average volume fractions of the particles with increasing Re. More importantly, the present experimental results suggest that, consideration of either the gas and particle characteristic length scales or the particle Reynolds number solely is insufficient to predict gas-phase turbulence modulation in gas–particle flows.},

The effect of the geometrical parameters and the flow parameters on the gas=particle temperature, the convection heat transfer coefficient between the wall and the gas-particle mixture, and the thermal entry length were studied. An increase in particle diameter (loading ratio \% 0.5) extended the thermal entry length and decreased the bulk mixed temperature, particle temperature, and convection heat transfer coefficient. Increasing the pipe diameter led to a significant reduction in bulk mixed temperature and thermal entry length, in addition to a decrease in particle temperature and Nusselt number. Increasing the loading ratio up to 2.36 led to a reduction in wall temperature and bulk mixed temperature, in addition to an increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient and thermal entry length.},

The reactor consists of two regions, i.e., a lower dense region and an upper dilute region. The dynamic two-phase structure was used for modeling the lower dense bed hydrodynamics. The upper region hydrodynamics was modeled by a cluster based approach. This allows the porosity distribution to be calculated for plug flow reactor model assumed for the gas phase in this region. The basic assumption in the cluster based approach is that the solid particles move only as clusters and the amount of single particles in the upper region is negligible. The mathematical model was obtained from coupling the kinetic sub-model, obtained from the literature, with this hydrodynamics sub-model. Comparing the results of the model with the experimental data available in the literature showed close agreement. Two other methods (i.e., particle based approach and short-cut) were also tested in this work. However, it was found that the cluster based approach modeling is quite suitable for the fluidized bed reactor used in this study. The short-cut method seems reasonably applicable for the prediction of the overall conversion but does not provide any local information (such as concentration profiles, yield, etc.) within the fluidized bed reactor.},

Account is taken of the fact that flow conditions in low porosity parts of a bed can be viewed as flow between particles. At high porosities the bed resembles flow past the particles of a dilute assemblage and for that the current model is complemented with results from other models. The new drag model, as well as other models found in literature, was tested in the numerical simulations.

  abstract      = {Aeration in Venturi tubes for microbubbles production has become popular in recent years as it enhanced the transportation of oxygen and other gases in wastewater treatment and mineral engineering. In an aerated Venturi, air/gas was injected upstream into the flowing liquid inside the Venturi tube. The air, flows inside the Venturi tube as bubbles, before breakup occurs downstream after the throat area. This method promoted the transportation of particular gases or substances in microbubbles. To further increase the generation of microbubbles, flowing liquid velocity was increased by decreasing the throat diameter, but cavitation started to emerge inside the tube as velocity increased. This present study aims to investigate the effect of reducing the throat diameter on the cavitation number of the aerated Venturi tube and how it affects the breakup characteristics of bubbles. Activities involved in the investigation were; visualization of flow and generated microbubbles, image processing of the images captured, pressure and void fraction measurement, and calculating the cavitation number. The result showed that reducing the throat diameter initiated the cavitation occurrence earlier, and in aerated cases, cavitation exists in the form of cavitated bubbles. Aeration also affects the cavitation number in a non-cavitated flow but does not significantly affect the existing cavitated flow. Reducing the throat diameter also successfully increased the generation of bubbles less than 0.2 mm but the overall SMD did not show a straightforward relationship with cavitation number.},

Hydrodynamic descriptions for the crucial parts of the unit are incorporated into the model. Special attention has been paid to the reactor riser to predict the velocity distributions of the catalyst and gas phases, the molar concentrations of IO-lump species, and the temperature profile by utilizing momentum, mass, and energy balances. The regenerator is modeled in such detail that the two-regime (dense bed and freeboard), two-phase (emulsion and bubble) behavior of typical fluidized beds can be described. The models for cyclones, valves, and several auxiliary units of the FCC unit are also applied to investigate their dynamic effects on the overall system. The resulting model equations are grouped into 14 modules each of which corresponds to a specific part of the unit and type of equations, and then an efficient iterative scheme is employed for convergence of all the modules. The model solver is constructed on the basis of a modular approach and then implemented by a Fortran code. Finally, to validate the developed simulator, the steady-state simulation results are compared with those in the literature and the dynamic responses of the process are predicted and analyzed. 0 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract      = {A process optimization system, which consists of a steady-state process model, a model parameter estimator and a process optimizer for a fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process under full and partial combustion modes, is presented in this paper. First, mathematical modeling was carried out for the reactor, regenerator, main-fractionator, and most of auxiliary units including the feed pre-heater, catalyst cooler, air blower, wet gas compressor, stack gas expander, boilers, and valves. Then, the resulting steady-state model was utilized to develop the model parameter estimator and the process optimizer both of which adopt a successive quadratic programming algorithm to efficiently locate the optimum solutions. The parameter estimator can estimate up to 52 model parameters in order to validate the process model by reducing process–model mismatch. The process optimizer maximizes the economic objective function defined as the difference between the total value of products and the cost of feedstock and utility under 30 operating constraints. The developed optimization system was applied to several optimization cases to maximize the economic profit of the FCC process operated in the full and partial combustion modes and the optimization results were extensively compared and analyzed between the combustion modes. It is expected that the proposed steady-state model, parameter estimation and optimization methods can be utilized to optimize and design modem-type FCC processes under full and partial combustion modes.},

Flow structure and solid flux of dilute phase regime were investigated along both vertical direction and horizontal direction under different boiler loads. Particle-size distribution and carbon content of oil shale combustion residues were obtained. Experimental investigation shows that SO2 concentration decreases with increasing the furnace height, and NOX emission can be reduced by adopting staged combustion technology, low-temperature combustion and circulating combustion. Experimental results are valuable for adjusting the 65 t/h boiler and designing largescale oil shale-fired CFB boiler. At the same time, the experiment lays a foundation for modeling the flow structure, combustion, heat transfer and abrasion of oil shale-fired CFB dilute phase regime.},

  abstract      = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is one of the modeling approaches essential to identifying the parameters that affect Containment Thermal Hydraulics (CTH) phenomena. While the CFD approach can capture the multidimensional behavior of CTH phenomena, its computational cost is high when modeling complex accident scenarios. To mitigate this expense, we propose reliance on coarse-grid CFD (CG-CFD). Coarsening the computational grid increases the grid-induced error thus requiring a novel approach that will produce a surrogate model predicting the distribution of the CG-CFD local error and correcting the fluid-flow variables. Given sufficiently fine-mesh simulations, a surrogate model can be trained to predict the CG-CFD local errors as a function of the coarse-grid local flow features. The surrogate model is constructed using Machine Learning (ML) regression algorithms. Two of the widely used ML regression algorithms were tested: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF). The proposed CG-CFD method is illustrated with a three-dimensional turbulent flow inside a lid-driven cavity. We studied a set of scenarios to investigate the capability of the surrogate model to interpolate and extrapolate outside the training data range. The proposed method has proven capable of correcting the coarse-grid results and obtaining reasonable predictions for new cases (of different Reynolds number, different grid sizes, or larger geometries). Based on the investigated cases, we found this novel method maximizes the benefit of the available data and shows potential for a good predictive capability.},

  abstract      = {Three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of Circulating Fluidized Beds (CFB's) have been performed. The computations are performed using a 3D multiphase computational fluid dynamics code with an Eulerian description of both gas and particle phases. The turbulent motion of the particulate phase is modeled using the kinetic theory for granular flow, and the gas phase turbulence is modeled using a Sub-Grid-Scale model. A computational study of a cold flowing CFB riser has been performed. The results have been compared to experimental findings of particle volume fraction, particle axial velocity, and pressure drop provided as a blind test in connection with the 10th International Workshop on Two-Phase Flow Prediction held in Merseburg, Germany, 2002. The simulated profiles are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments, but the extend of the radial solid segregation is under predicted in the lower part of the riser. In the upper dilute part of the riser there is good agreement between simulated and measured values both for the solid volume fraction and the pressure profile. A cold flowing riser fluidized with FCC catalysts has been studied. The results were submitted to a blind-test in connection to the 10th international workshop on two-phase flow prediction held in Merseburg, Germany, 2002. The results are validated against experimental findings of particle mass flux across the riser and pressure profile along the riser. The calculations show good agreement with experimental findings of both mass flux and pressure profile, but further improvements are proposed and investigated. A parameter study shows that mesh refinement, choice of particle diameter and choice of drag model are crucial when simulating FCC riser flow. The isothermal decomposition of ozone has been implemented in the CFD code FLOTRACS-MP-3D. The decomposition reaction is studied in a 3D representation of a 0.254 m i.d. riser, which has been studied experimentally by Ouyang et al. (1993). Comparison between measured and simulated time-averaged ozone concentration at different elevations in the riser shows good agreement. The 3D representation of the reactor geometry gives better predictions of the radial variation in concentration than in a similar 2D simulation, Samuelsberg and Hjertager (1995). A parameter study is performed to investigate improvements in the predicted pressure drop profile. When using two-fluid modeling to predict riser flows there have been difficulties in predicting the solids hold up in risers represented by the correct pressure drop profile. Mesh refinement has shown to improve the axial segregation of particles in the riser, but when simulating a riser with a large L/D like an FCC riser in 3D, one is still limited to using rather coarse grids. Another way to get better results would be to use more than one solids phase to represent the actual particle size distribution. The introduction of more particle phases and use of a fine mesh resolution leads to an increase in CPU time. To reduce the wall-clock time for the simulations, the in-house code, FLOTRACS-MP-3D, has been parallelized using domain decomposition. In order to study the influence of mesh resolution and the addition of Eulerian phases, two test cases are investigated. Flow in a lab-scale CFB of the boiler type with a low L/D of 8 and flow in a FCC riser with a larger L/D of 48. For both risers comparison between measured and simulated pressure profile along the riser is performed. For the CFB riser comparisons are made for solids velocities and for the FCC riser measured and simulated solids fluxes are compared. In both cases the simulations compare well to the experiments. For the FCC riser it is concluded that the introduction of more particle phases only give minor improvements in the predictions. For the CFB riser the use of a very fine mesh gives indications of a dense bottom zone that has been almost absent in previous simulations of the case. The simulations have been performed using a parallelized CFD code. It is demonstrated that the number of partitions has no effect in the time averaged results obtained from simulations.},

The catalytic performances of the catalysts in methane reforming with CO2 were investigated in a quartz micro-reactor. The results indicated that the aerogel catalyst showed higher specific surface area and higher dispersivity of nickel species than those of impregnation catalyst. The excellent catalytic performances and stabilities were achieved over the aerogel catalysts in the fluidized bed reactor. Comprehensive characterization with TG, XRD and FESEM revealed that the aerogel catalyst in the fluidized bed had much lower carbon deposition than that in the fixed bed. The fluidization of the aerogel catalyst greatly improved the contact efficiency of gas–solid phase, which accelerated the gasification of the deposited carbon. In contrast, the deactivation of the aerogel catalyst was caused by the carbon deposition due to the catalyst without moving in the fixed bed. Moreover, decreasing activity of the impregnation catalyst in the fluidized bed resulted from the poor fluidization state of catalyst particles and low effective active sites on surface of catalyst.},

  abstract      = {The slot flow meter (SFM) is a device for measuring continuously a flow of granular material. The meter is a hopper, open at the top and closed at the bottom, with vertical sides containing vertical slots. The hopper is fed continuously from above with granular material which flows out through the slots; because the flow through a slot depends upon the depth of powder upstream of the slot, the inventory of granular material in the hopper is uniquely determined by the flow rate. Hence by mounting the hopper on a load cell to measure the inventory, the flow can be inferred: the cell reading gives a continuous measure of flow rate. Experimental and theoretical work on the flow of granular material through vertical slots is described. Calibration was by an in situ technique based on the dynamic response to change of input flow. This technique was tested against direct calibration (bucket-and-stopwatch) for a pilot-scale unit installed in the particle circulation loop of a fast fluidised bed.},

In this work, we have developed a 2D, steady state model of a rotary desiccant wheel. Mass and energy balance equations for the air streams and the desiccant wheels were developed. The hydraulic diameter and surface area for heat and mass transfer were calculated based on knowledge of the flute geometry. Appropriate correlations for the Sherwood number and Nusselt number were used to estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients. The model is capable of predicting steady state behavior of desiccant wheels having at the most three sections (process, purge, and regeneration). The mathematical model was validated using a real desiccant wheel, and the calculation results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Based on this model, the temperature and humidity profiles in the wheel during both the dehumidification and the regeneration processes are analyzed. The simulated results were used to gain an insight into the operation of desiccant wheels. The model and the presented results will be useful for optimizing dehumidification and energy recovery applications.           ,              A 2D steady state model of a rotary desiccant wheel is developed.

  abstract      = {Atomization of liquid jets in gaseous crossflows has many natural and industrial applications, for example, in fuel atomization in gas turbine engines, rocket engines, film cooling, and, recently, suspension and solution precursor plasma spraying processes for the development of advanced coatings. Viscosity and density of the gaseous medium may significantly vary in applications such as plasma spraying, which can affect the instability waves on the liquid jet column, resulting in a major change in the mechanism of primary and secondary breakups. In this study, a numerical model is used to investigate the impact of gas viscosity on breakup mechanisms for a wide range of density ratios and Weber numbers. Due to many challenges, only a few comprehensive atomization measurements have been performed on this subject. However, novel computational models could provide the atomization process with a thorough picture in the last two decades. The incompressible variable-density Navier–Stokes equations are solved by using finite volume schemes, and a geometric volume-of-fluid technique is used to track the gas–liquid interface. In our parametric study, three sets of density ratios and Weber numbers are chosen. In each set, four cases with different orders of magnitude of gaseous Reynolds number are simulated. Different characteristics of jet atomization are analyzed, such as the jet trajectory, breakup location, and surface instabilities generated along the jet column. Ultimately, the effects of gaseous Reynolds number, density ratio, and Weber number on jet deformation and breakup mechanisms are discussed.},

  abstract      = {The physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) method offers a mesh-free approach for solving partial differential equations, converting the task into an optimization problem based on loss functions. By utilizing the physical governing equations, this study explores the development of a physics-driven PINNs model in solving coupled fluid flow and heat transfer problems. This approach eliminates the need for additional simulation or experimental training data, so it obviates the extra effort and computational cost associated with generating training data. The methodology is exemplified through the analysis of natural convection in a confined cavity, a challenging benchmark problem for coupled fluid flow and heat transfer scenarios. Moreover, the study examines key aspects of the PINNs, including the hyperparameter performance, convergence and accuracy analysis. We investigate in detail the accuracy and convergence behavior concerning variables such as the collocation point size, neural network size, loss functions, optimizers, network architecture, and activation functions. This comprehensive analysis aims to emphasize the importance of achieving higher predictive accuracy, which contributes significantly to enhancing the performance of the physics-driven PINNs model in predicting coupled fluid flow and heat transfer problems. Remarkably, the study introduces a novel technique to improve prediction accuracy without the need for sampling more points, consequently reducing computational costs. This is achieved through the integration of high-resolution regions within the domain. PINNs demonstrate promising performance, accurately capturing complex interactions between fluid flow and heat transfer. Further improvements are also observed when coupling the model with nondimensionalized governing equations and introducing a continuous weighting scheme for boundary loss functions to avoid sharp discontinuities at corners. It is also observed that at high Rayleigh numbers with significant gradients, variations in the efficacy of the training procedure may occur between different simulation runs due to the random generation of collocation points if an insufficient number of samples are used.},

  abstract      = {Particle entrainment is investigated by measuring the velocity required to pick up particles from rest, also known as pickup velocity. Pickup velocity is a function of individual particle characteristics and interparticle forces. Although 5 – 200 Am particles are investigated, the work presented here focuses on the pickup of particles in a pile in the size range of 5 – 35 Am. These smaller particle sizes are more typical for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, such as dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Pickup velocities varied from 3.9 to 16.9 m/s for the range of particle sizes investigated.},

It reveals that all previous models on the hydrodynamics of the riser in a circulating fluidized bed system are either incomplete or theoretically flawed. A new approach to the modelling of solids distribution in the riser is proposed. The approach identifies that the volume-average voidage in a riser is determined by two independent process variables, e.g. the gas velocity and the pressure drop across the riser. It also indicates that the pattern of solids distribution in a riser is related to the mechanism by which the solids are circulated.},

The complete growth and collapse processes during an interaction are successfully reproduced, and interaction regimes of double cavitation bubbles are systematically studied, including strong and weak interactions. The critical distances to distinguish different interaction modes between two equal-sized bubbles are also proposed. For the weak interaction regime of two unequal-sized bubbles, the pressure wave generated by the smaller cavitation bubble leads to less distortion of the larger bubble in the final collapse stage. Moreover, a modified inertia model is proposed, which can be used to predict the liquid film thickness evolution of the unequal-sized bubbles under strong interaction regimes. Unbalanced forces act on the liquid film for two unequal-sized bubbles, making the film more difficult to rupture than for equal-sized bubbles, and the coalescence regime needs a smaller initial distance between them. Finally, the ``shield effect'' of the outer layer cavitation bubble and the ``wall effect'' of inner layer cavitation bubbles have been accurately reproduced in a cavitation bubble cluster, and the toroidal bubble shape in the final collapse stage is successfully simulated.},

A fluidized bed of rod-like particles was chosen as a typical case to investigate the effect of different fluid grid scales on various fluidized bed characteristic parameters. The calculation performance of the semi-resolved and unresolved CFD-DEM coupling algorithm on key fluidized bed characteristic parameters such as average pressure drop, particle frequency distribution with bed height, and particle orientation distribution were compared. It was found that the semi-resolved CFD-DEM coupling algorithm gradually obtained results with higher consistency with decreasing fluid grid scale for key parameters such as particle frequency distribution with bed height, particle orientation distribution, and time-history mixing index, exhibiting a phenomenon similar to grid independence in fluid simulation. By comparing with experimental results, it was verified that the semi-resolved CFD-DEM coupling algorithm can be applied to simulate multi-granular gas-solid systems with fluid grid scales equivalent to particle scales. This algorithm solves the limitation of fluid grid scale in the unresolved CFD-DEM coupling framework and improves the grid adaptability of the CFD-DEM coupling simulation algorithm.},

Due to the temporal mismatch between the production and demand of renewables, seasonal energy storage is proposed as a way to bridge the gap and ensure reliable power supply throughout the year. In this article, we demonstrate a seasonal energy storage process based on the redox pair iron/iron oxide, where energy is stored in the form of fine iron powder produced on-site by reducing iron oxide with electrolytic hydrogen, and released by oxidizing iron with steam. We prove its feasibility at a technically relevant scale, in a 1 : 10 scaled-down pilot reactor representing the electricity need of a typical European household. The operating data of the reactor, together with physico-chemical analysis of the iron/iron oxide during this process, and calculated estimation of its investment cost, provide a solid foundation for its future application in the field of energy storage.},

To address mass transport limitations structured internals can be used in trickle bed reactors (TBRs) as the most frequently used reactor for heterogeneously catalyzed multiphase reactions. However, reactions in TBRs are frequently limited by gas–liquid mass transfer. As periodic open cellular structures (POCS) as reactor internals were not addressed regarding g–l mass transfer yet, this contribution provides first data on gas–liquid mass transfer for different types of POCS. Therefore, desorption of dissolved oxygen in water with nitrogen gas and the two-phase pressure drop were measured. Strut-based Kelvin and diamond unit cell POCS were compared to a sphere random packed bed as a benchmark. A novel sheet-based unit cell was developed realizing meandering channels demonstrating a fivefold increase in volumetric mass transfer coefficient compared to the benchmark. To compare the performance of the setup with literature data, state of the art neural network correlations were used for comparison. This proof of concept highlights the potential of additively manufactured POCS for intensified processes in trickle bed reactors, and demonstrates their versatility in application.},

The motion of particles is treated by a Lagrangian approach, and particles are assumed to interact through binary, instantaneous, non-frontal, and inelastic collisions with friction. The model for the interstitial gas phase is based on the Navier–Stokes equations for two-phase flow with fluid turbulence calculated by using LES. Several porosity functions exist in the literature relating the drag force for a particle in a cloud to the drag force on an isolated particle. We have studied the influences of this porosity function, observing large differences in the local flow structure. The fluctuating gas–solid motion has been investigated showing a strong anisotropic flow behaviour, which is similar to experimental findings. The instabilities in these flows are strongly linked to the non-linear drag function due to the group effect of particles in a cloud. The collision parameters have been found to have an important influence on the cluster structures. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Gas–particle flows in a vertical two-dimensional configuration appropriate for circulating fluidised bed applications were investigated numerically. In the computational study presented herein the motion of particles was calculated based on a Lagrangian approach and particles were assumed to interact through binary, instantaneous, non-frontal, inelastic collisions including friction. The model for the interstitial gas phase is based on the Navier–Stokes equations for two-phase flows. The numerical study of cluster structures has been validated with experimental results from literature in a previous investigation. Numerical experiments were performed in order to study the effects of different cluster and particle rebound characteristics on the gas–particle flow behaviour.},

FCC catalyst particles with a Sauter mean diameter of 68 pm and sand particles with mean diameters of 125 pm and 276 pm were used in the tests. The results showed the local time-average solid mass flux to vary with radial position, elevation, total solid mass flow, superficial gas velocity and mean particle diameter. Based on the solid mass flux and local solid concentration measurements, and on video studies, a physical description of the solid flow phenomena in CFBs is presented.},

After a discussion of how to define the wall location and roughness height in the most reasonable way, a numerical approach based on the determination of entropy production in rough pipes and channels is presented. As test cases, three different two-dimensional roughness types have been chosen which are representative of regular roughnesses on machined surfaces. In the turbulent range, skin friction results with these test roughnesses can be linked to Nikuradse's sand roughness results by a constant factor. For laminar flows, a significant effect of wall roughness is identified which in most other studies is neglected completely. The dissipation model of this study is validated with experimental data for laminar and turbulent flows.},

We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

Biogas has beneficial environmental aspects such as waste treatment, production of energy from waste and general substrates and a better way to spread the fermented residues through improved nutrient and flow abilities. The objective of this study was to assess the status of biogas production and its effects on the environment due to greenhouse gases (GHG) and other environmental impacts. In this work, 15 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of biogas systems from around Europe were reviewed. Biogas scenarios in all the studies had lower GHG intensities than their reference systems. The study shows that the type of feedstock, e.g., maize, grass or animal manure is a determining factor for the environmental impacts of biogas systems. Improving biogas plant technology and management by collecting the biogas during the storage of digested residues or installing a gas flare will improve the greenhouse gas balance of biogas systems. In comparison with traditional manure storage, anaerobic digestion of animal manure avoids methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and adds to the substitution of artificial mineral fertilizer. Apart from the impacts resulting from the production of energy crops, acidification (AC) and eutrophication (EP) from biogas systems could be reduced by using combined heat and power units (CHPU) with catalytic converters and high efficiency.},

  abstract      = {A geometrical modification of the well-known Sulzer SMXTM static mixer, the new SMX plus (patent pending), is found to lead to significant improvement of the mixing performance. Using a reduced number of bars, and gaps between the bars, the pressure drop of the mixer can be reduced to less than 50\% while the mixing quality after a given number of elements remains nearly equivalent with the original SMX. CFD simulations are being relied upon to show the performance of the SMX plus both with regard to pressure drop, mixing quality and residence time distribution. These results are confirmed by LIF measurements. The mixing performance for streams with strongly different viscosities is investigated using a decolorization technique. Finally the dispersion behavior of this new mixer is measured.},

  abstract      = {Always, oil spills do cause serious and dire consequences for the environment, nature, and society that it consumes much time and socio-economic resources to overcome such consequences. Oil spills, hence, posed a big challenge in searching the advanced technologies and devices to recover spilled oil rapidly and efficiently. Indeed, sorbents have been found to play an extremely critical role in the spilled-oil remediation processes. Recently, a large number of various advanced sorbents and sorbent-based oil-collecting devices/technologies have been developed to enhance the oil-recovery capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to have a comprehensive assessment of the application of sorbent-based oil-collecting devices/technologies in recovering spilled oil. Due to this reason, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the advanced technologies of the combination of sorbents and oil-collecting devices in the oil cleanup strategies. Two main oil-collecting devices such as booms and skimmers that could conjunct with sorbents were critically evaluated on the basis of the applicability and technological features, indicating that the capacity of oil spill recovery could achieve 90\%. Moreover, oil-storage and oil-collecting devices were also completely mentioned. Last but not least, technical directions, concerns over the application of sorbents in oil recovery, and existing challenges relating to storage, transport, and disposal of used sorbents were discussed in detail. In the future, the automatic process of spilled oil recovery with the conjunction between advanced devices and environmentally friendly high-efficiency sorbents should be further investigated to minimize the environmental impacts, reduce the cost, as well as maximize the collected oil spill.},

  abstract      = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology demonstrate considerable potential to complement human capital intensive activities. While an emerging literature documents wide-ranging productivity effects of AI, relatively little attention has been paid to how AI might change the nature of work itself. How do individuals, especially those in the knowledge economy, adjust how they work when they start using AI? Using the setting of open source software, we study individual level effects that AI has on task allocation. We exploit a natural experiment arising from the deployment of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI code completion tool for software developers. Leveraging millions of work activities over a two year period, we use a program eligibility threshold to investigate the impact of AI technology on the task allocation of software developers within a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design. We find that having access to Copilot induces such individuals to shift task allocation towards their core work of coding activities and away from non-core project management activities. We identify two underlying mechanisms driving this shift - an increase in autonomous rather than collaborative work, and an increase in exploration activities rather than exploitation. The main effects are greater for individuals with relatively lower ability. Overall, our estimates point towards a large potential for AI to transform work processes and to potentially flatten organizational hierarchies in the knowledge economy.},

Measurements were performed over a range of motion encoding times to confirm that the experiments were in the ballistic regime. The results confirm that the granular temperature arises from shear induced by the bubble motion. It was found that the hydrodynamics in the 2D and 3D geometries were significantly different with lower bubble velocities but a higher bubble temperature in the 2D bed than in the 3D bed. The granular temperature was also found to be highly anisotropic, with Tz up to 10 times greater than Tx or Ty.},

  abstract      = {Digital Twins (DTs) are computational models that simulate the states and temporal dynamics of real-world systems, playing a crucial role in prediction, understanding, and decision-making across diverse domains. However, existing approaches to DTs often struggle to generalize to unseen conditions in data-scarce settings, a crucial requirement for such models. To address these limitations, our work begins by establishing the essential desiderata for effective DTs. Hybrid Digital Twins (\$\textbackslash textbf\{HDTwins\}\$) represent a promising approach to address these requirements, modeling systems using a composition of both mechanistic and neural components. This hybrid architecture simultaneously leverages (partial) domain knowledge and neural network expressiveness to enhance generalization, with its modular design facilitating improved evolvability. While existing hybrid models rely on expert-specified architectures with only parameters optimized on data, \$\textbackslash textit\{automatically\}\$ specifying and optimizing HDTwins remains intractable due to the complex search space and the need for flexible integration of domain priors. To overcome this complexity, we propose an evolutionary algorithm (\$\textbackslash textbf\{HDTwinGen\}\$) that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously propose, evaluate, and optimize HDTwins. Specifically, LLMs iteratively generate novel model specifications, while offline tools are employed to optimize emitted parameters. Correspondingly, proposed models are evaluated and evolved based on targeted feedback, enabling the discovery of increasingly effective hybrid models. Our empirical results reveal that HDTwinGen produces generalizable, sample-efficient, and evolvable models, significantly advancing DTs' efficacy in real-world applications.},

In this paper, we present a cheap and robust segmentation procedure to identify bubbles from bubble swarm images. This is done in three steps. First, individual, nonoverlapping bubbles are detected and isolated from true experimental images. In the second step, these bubble images are combined to generate synthetic ground truth images. In the third and final step, the synthetic images are used as training data for a machine learning script. The trained model can now be used to segment the data of experimental bubble swarms.

A novel design approach based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS11Triply periodic minimal surfaces.), an interesting class of smoothened curved surfaces, led to the conception of new periodic structures with complex geometrical features. The present study aims to assess the applicability of these new TPMS-based geometries as packing for gas–liquid contactors and the effect of their topology on performance. Liquid holdup, pressure drop, flooding and mass transfer efficiency were evaluated for three TPMS-based prototypes, with distinct characteristic dimensions. A new experimental setup was developed for the estimation of liquid holdup based on the measure of the liquid weight during operation by a set of load cells. Results show good repeatability and precision, allowing to distinguish liquid holdup between the prototypes for various gas and liquid flow rates. Two of the studied prototypes presented higher holdup than the 5 ppi ceramic foam and the 15~mm Raschig rings for lower liquid rates. Prototypes also showed good results for pressure drop, with flooding reached at gas load factors above 3Pa0.5. In terms of mass transfer efficiency, HETP results for the new prototypes remained between 0.35m and 0.45m, comparable to Mellapak 250Y.},

By embracing the generalized Onsager principle, a coupled hydrodynamics and phase field system is introduced that can describe the fluid-structure interactions with moving contact lines in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The resulting partial differential equation (PDE) model consists of the Navier-Stokes equation and a nonlinear Allen-Cahn type equation. Volume conservation is enforced through an additional penalty term. A fully-discrete structure-preserving numerical scheme is proposed by combining several techniques to solve this coupled PDE system effectively and accurately. For the temporal discretization, we utilize the supplementary variable method for preserving the thermodynamic structure and the projection approach for reducing the problem size. Then, we use the finite difference method on the staggered grid for spatial discretization. Furthermore, we have rigorously proved that the proposed numerical scheme based on the second-order backward difference formula respects the original energy stability, i.e., the scheme is energy stable. Additionally, with the aid of the supplementary variable method, the resultant scheme can be transformed into a constrained optimization problem, where the solutions of the supplementary variables are the arguments of the objective function that reaches the optimality. Then the augmented Lagrangian method is introduced in part to bring robustness and efficiency to solving such a constrained optimization problem. Finally, various numerical simulations verify the model's capability and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness, accuracy, and stability.},

  abstract      = {A discrete particle model of a gas-fluidised bed has been developed and in this the twodimensional motion of the individual, spherical particles was directly calculated from the forces acting on them, accounting for the interaction betweenthe particles and the interstitial gas phase. Our collisionmodel is based on conservation laws for linear and angular momentum and requires, apart from geometrical factors, two empirical parameters: a restitution coefficientand a friction coefficient.A sequenceof collisions is processed using techniques whichfind their application in hard-sphere simulations which are commonly encountered in the field of molecular dynamics.The hydrodynamic model of the gas phase is based on the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Simulations of bubble and slug formation in a small twodimensional bed (height 0.50m, width 0.15m) with 2400 particles (dp = 4 mm, material: aluminium, p = 2700 kg m- 3) showed a strong dependencyof the flowbehaviour with respectto the restitution and friction coefficient.A preliminary experimental validation of our model was performed using a small scale "two-dimensional" gas-fluidisedbed (height 0.30m, width 0.15m, depth 0.015m) with 850/\textasciitilde m ballotini glass particles (p = 2930kgm -3) as the bed material. Results compared fairly well with the results of a simulation which was performedwith 40,000particles using realisticvaluesfor the restitution and friction coefficientswhich were obtained from simple independent experiments.},

Special focus was placed on the concepts of turbulent and fast fluidization regimes. Based on careful measurements of flow structure and cluster behavior, it is demonstrated that the turbulent fluidization regime is a transition regime between bubbling and fast fluidization. Experimental evidence supports the postulate that in fast fluidization the clusters adjust their size so that the gas drag force acting on them compensates with their gravity.},

Furthermore, by applying mdtiple laser sheets the threedimensional structure of the suspension can be investigated. In the dilute suspension above a bubbling fluidized bed, the so called ``ghost bubbles'' were clearly visualized. In the dilute phase transportation regime the existence of clusters was confirmed. The average shape of a cluster was a paraboloid heading downward and enclosing a gas wake. in the upper side. From a cluster, particles were shed to the dilute phase continuously and these were again absorbed by other clusters. Cluster sizes and their velocity distributions were determined from the video Image analysis.

Some of the models are counterintuitive, and figuring out how and why they work will both entertain and give insights.

  abstract      = {Trigonometry has 2000-year-old roots in everyday useful endeavors, like finding the size of an object too big or far away to measure directly, or navigating from Point A to Point B. However, it is often taught very theoretically, with an emphasis on abstractions. Make: Trigonometry uses 3D printable models and readily-available physical objects like wire and cardboard tubes to develop intuition about concepts in trigonometry and basic analytic geometry. Readers will imagine the thought process of the people who invented these mathematical concepts, and can try out "math experiments" to see for themselves how ingenious ancient navigators and surveyors really were. The analytic geometry part of the book links equations to many of these intuitive concepts, which we explore through in-depth explanations of manipulative models of conic sections. This book is aimed at high school students who might be in Algebra II or Pre-Calculus. It shows the geometrical and practical sides of these topics that otherwise can drown in their own algebra. Make: Trigonometry builds on the basics of the authors' earlier book, Make: Geometry, and is intended as a bridge from that book to their Make: Calculus book. The user can read this book and understand the concepts from the photographs of 3D printable models alone. However, since many models are puzzle-like, we encourage the reader to print the models on any consumer-grade filament based 3D printer. The models are available for download in a freely-available open source repository. They were created in the free program OpenSCAD, and can be 3D printed or modified by the student in OpenSCAD to learn a little coding along the way},

Analyses of mixing and flow fields have been carried out for a wide range – 0.267–267 – of the Reynolds number. Mixing in the channels has been analyzed by using Navier–Stokes equations with two working fluids, water and ethanol. The results show that the squarewave microchannel yields the best mixing performance, and the curved and the zig-zag microchannels show nearly the same performance for most Reynolds number. For all three cases, the pressure drop has been calculated for channels with equal streamwise lengths. The curved channel exhibits the smallest pressure drop among the microchannels, while the pressure drops in the square-wave and zig-zag channels are approximately the same.},

The experiments demonstrated that both CO and CO2 are formed as primary products, and the rate of methane disappearance is proportional to the partial pressure of methane at low product concentrations. The effect of total pressure on initial reaction rates indicated that the rate controlling steps of steam reforming are surface reactions between adsorbed species. Six possible reaction mechanisms were considered in detail, and intrinsic rate equations were derived by using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LH–HW) approach and Freundlich's adsorption concept. Applying the method of parameter estimation and model discrimination, a satisfactory model of intrinsic kinetics for methane steam reforming over the catalyst used was determined. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental data and results predicted from the kinetic model.},

The basic model of the solid oxide electrolysis cell was accomplished in Simulink and experiments were performed under a diversified input/output operating environment. The experimental results of the solid oxide electrolysis cell basic parameter system generated 15 datasets. The system identification process involved the utilization of these datasets with the application of nonlinear autoregressive-exogenous models. Initially, data identification came from the Matlab mechanism model. Then, the nonlinear autoregressive-exogenous structures were estimated and selected exploratively through an individual operating condition. In terms of fitness, we conclude that the solid oxide electrolysis cell parameter system cannot be satisfied by a solitary autoregressive-exogenous model for all datasets. Nevertheless, the nonlinear autoregressive-exogenous model utilized S-type nonlinearities to fit a total of 2 validation datasets and 15 estimated datasets. The obtained results were compared with the basic parameter system of a solid oxide electrolysis cell, and the nonlinear autoregressive-exogenous projected output demonstrated an accuracy of over 93\% across diverse operational circumstances--regardless of whether there was noise interference. This result has positive significance for the future use of the solid oxide electrolysis cell to achieve the dual carbon goal in China.},

Good and uniform contact of the liquid droplets with the solid particles is required to provide heat for the cracking reactions while minimizing mass transfer effects. Experiments in a pilot plant coker have suggested that the initial particle/liquid mixing, in the spray jet, is rather poor.

The wall-bounded turbulent particle-laden flows in which the experimental data are available are chosen as the test problems for demonstration. Results obtained with the deterministic method accounting for interparticle collisions are used as a basis for validating the proposed stochastic Lagrangian model. Good agreement between the predictions obtained separately with the deterministic and DSMC methods is achieved. The benefit of saving computational expenditure when using the DSMC method becomes more remarkable than the deterministic method as the number of particles loaded in the flow is increased. In addition, the study demonstrates that \ensuremath{\tau}P/\ensuremath{\tau}C is a proper parameter to monitor the role of inter-particle collisions in the physical processes of particle-laden flows.},

  abstract      = {Propylene production via nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) holds great promise in meeting growing global demand for propylene. Effective adsorptive purification of a low concentration of propylene from quinary PDH byproducts comprising methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), propylene (C3H6), and propane (C3H8) has been an unsolved academic bottleneck. Herein, we now report an ultramicroporous zinc metal-organic framework (Zn-MOF, termed as 1) underlying a rigid one-dimensional channel, enabling trace C3H6 capture and effective separation from quinary PDH byproducts. Adsorption isotherms of 1 suggest a record-high C3H6 uptake of 34.0/92.4 cm3 cm-3 (0.01/0.1 bar) at 298 K. In situ spectroscopies, crystallographic experiments, and modeling have jointly elucidated that the outstanding propylene uptakes at lower pressure are dominated by multiple binding interactions and swift diffusion behavior, yielding quasi-orthogonal configuration of propylene in adaptive channels. Breakthrough tests demonstrate that 30.8 L of propylene with a serviceable purity of 95.0-99.4\% can be accomplished from equimolar C3H6/C3H8 mixtures for 1 kg of activated 1. Such an excellent property is also validated by the breakthrough tests of quinary mixtures containing CH4/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8 (3/5/6/ 42/44, v/v/v/v/v). Particularly, structurally stable 1 can be easily synthesized on the kilogram scale using cheap materials (only \$167 for per kilogram of 1), which is important in industrial applications.},

Through the deployment of SHapley Additive exPlanations values, critical features relevant to coalescence processes are consistently identified. Comprehensive feature ablation tests further delineate the robustness and susceptibility of each model. Furthermore, the incorporation of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations for local interpretability offers an elucidative perspective, clarifying the intricate decision-making mechanisms inherent to each model's predictions. As a result, this research provides the relative importance of the features for the outcome of drop interactions.

  abstract      = {Heavy feed cracking is certain to play an increasingly important role in oil refining. Against this backdrop, this work aims to gain some understanding of how thermolysis affects the manner in which a heavy Arabian vacuum resid droplet vaporizes in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Specifically, we study the vaporization history of the droplet under two limiting conditions that bracket the actual vaporization process. One is a high-temperature environment in which the catalyst heats up only the resid droplet. Another is a low-temperature environment in which the catalyst vaporizes a gas oil before heating the resid droplet. Key findings are as follows: (1) Droplet life can go through one, two, or three stages, depending on the drop size and environment. A large droplet in the high-temperature environment goes through the heat-up, thermolysis and evaporation stages. A small droplet at low temperatures goes through only the heat-up stage. (2) The effect of thermolysis increases with temperature and the initial drop size. (3) Thermolysis can significantly lower the drop's steady-state temperature--the larger the drop, the greater the effect and, hence, the longer the drop lifetime and (4). During the evaporation stage, the drop's surface area decrease can be approximated by the classical D2-law.},

A more feasible method is proposed to determine the acceleration length from the measured axial profiles of pressure gradient (or apparent solids holdup). With this new method and large amounts of experimental results, a clear picture of the variation of the acceleration length with both solids circulating rate and superficial gas velocity is obtained. It is found that the acceleration length increases generally with increasing solids flow rate and/or decreasing gas velocity. However, the particular variation patterns of the acceleration length with operating conditions are quite different in different operation ranges. Especially under the conditions near or at the accumulative choking, the acceleration length extends rapidly with increasing solids flow rate and/or decreasing gas velocity, and sometimes takes up the whole riser height. Reasonable explanations are provided for the observed variation patterns of the acceleration length.},

The present work focuses on modeling the transient behavior of large CFB units, whose flow characteristics were shown to yield C-shaped voidage profiles using cork as the fluidizing material and air at ambient conditions. The riser is modeled in two ways: 1) as a set of well-mixed tanks connected in series; 2) as a 1-D axisymetric cluster flow. The tanks-in-series model visualizes the riser as consisting of a series of well-mixed vessels. When the gas flow rate is constant and solids flow rate changes as a sine wave function, the voidages along the riser indicate a family of sine waves with significant phase shifts. Using this method, the dynamic response time at different locations along the riser was estimated successfully. The cluster flow model assumes that gas and solids flows are unidirectional with no mixing in the axial direction, and the solids move upward in the riser as clusters. This model can be used to predict the smooth changes in voidage profiles for transient processes.},

  abstract      = {Hydrodynamics and flow development are studied in a long riser circulating fluidized bed reactor (15.1 m). Optic fiber probes were used for the measurement of local solids distribution. Pressure drops were also measured with pressure transducers along the riser. The flow development in the riser center is almost instant with solids holdup remaining constant and low, and particle velocity remaining high along the riser. The particle flow is firstly developed from center, and then towards the wall. The riser height is an important factor for the design of circulating fluidized bed reactors. Increasing the solid circulating rate significantly slows down the flow development process, while increases in the superficial gas velocity accelerate it.},

  abstract      = {There is a growing interest in the role that LLMs play in chemistry which lead to an increased focus on the development of LLMs benchmarks tailored to chemical domains to assess the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of chemical tasks varying in type and complexity. However, existing benchmarks in this domain fail to adequately meet the specific requirements of chemical research professionals. To this end, we propose \textbackslash textbf\{\textbackslash textit\{ChemEval\}\}, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4 crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across 42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on ChemEval under zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, which included carefully selected demonstration examples and carefully designed prompts. The results show that while general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 excel in literature understanding and instruction following, they fall short in tasks demanding advanced chemical knowledge. Conversely, specialized LLMs exhibit enhanced chemical competencies, albeit with reduced literary comprehension. This suggests that LLMs have significant potential for enhancement when tackling sophisticated tasks in the field of chemistry. We believe our work will facilitate the exploration of their potential to drive progress in chemistry.

Then a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is further developed to simulate solid-liquid phase change phenomena in multiphase systems. We test the developed LB method by the problem of conduction-induced freezing in a semi-infinite space, the three-phase Stefan problem, and the droplet solidification on a cold surface, and the numerical results are in agreement with the analytical and experimental solutions. In addition, the LB method is also used to study the rising bubbles with solidification. The results of the present method not only accurately capture the effect of bubbles on the solidification process, but also are in agreement with the previous work. Finally, a parametric study is carried out to examine the influences of some physical parameters on the sessile droplet solidification, and it is found that the time of droplet solidification increases with the increase of droplet volume and contact angle.},

  abstract      = {The interaction between cavitation bubbles and plastrons on superhydrophobic surfaces was investigated using a low-voltage discharge device and high-speed photography techniques. The plastron adhered to the superhydrophobic surface acts as a liquid–gas interface, giving the boundary the ability to repel cavitation bubbles. The direction of bubble collapse is determined by the vector synthesis of the Bjerknes repulsive force from the plastron and the Bjerknes attractive force from the rigid wall when the bubble collapses for the first time. Various collapse behaviors were observed, including bubbles moving away from the plastron, bubbles orienting towards the plastron, and bubbles splitting into sub-bubbles in opposite directions. During the subsequent evolution of the bubbles, the expansion of the plastron led to the reversal of the downward jet or reduced the impact velocity of the jet. Seven jet patterns were identified based on the evolution of the cavitation bubble. Starting from the impact velocity of the jet, three jet patterns, namely, the jet away from the plastron (JA), the funnel-shaped jet away from the plastron (JAF), and the funnel-shaped jet away from the plastron with vortex shedding (JAFV), were found to have a weaker effect on the boundary. Three criteria for the design of plastrons on superhydrophobic surfaces were established: VP{$>$}0.25Vmax, HP{\$>\$}0.55Rmax, DP{\$>\$}1.2Rmax. Passive pulsation of the plastron in response to the cavitation bubble exhibited similar behaviors across seven jet patterns except for the JAF pattern: torus-shaped, dish-shaped, and skirt-shaped. The dimensionless wall distance, volume ratio, and plastron morphology parameters were identified as significant factors influencing the interaction between cavitation bubbles and the plastron.},

  abstract      = {The development of the cross-sectional distribution of the concentration of fine powders in dilute phase pneumatic conveying through different pipe elements was examined in detail in order to characterize the degree of segregation. The pipe system considered involved horizontal and vertical pipes connected by pipe bends of different bend radii. Additionally, it was possible to change the configuration into a combination of horizontal pipe, pipe bend, and horizontal pipe. Measurements were performed using smooth glass pipes and stainless steel pipes with a known degree of roughness. The average conveying velocity was varied between 10 and 30 m/s, and particle mass loadings between 0.2 and 1.0 (kg dust/kg air) were considered. The particles used in the study were spherical glass beads with a number mean diameter of 40 pm. The laser-light sheet method combined with digital image processing was applied to characterize the degree of non-uniformity of the particle concentration distribution in the different pipe elements. With the light sheet intersecting the pipe cross-section at an angle of about 45'', it was possible to obtain an entire field picture of the intensity of the light scattered by the particles. Using a simplified theory, the power of the scattered light could be related to the particle concentration distribution in the cross-section of different pipe elements (e.g. horizontal and vertical pipes). Additionally, information on the particle velocity and the spatial development of the particle size distribution were obtained by phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) which allowed single point measurements along a line through the pipe cross-section. Moreover, accurate particle concentration measurements were performed by PDA with a recently developed method. The results revealed the influence of the different flow conditions, i.e. conveying velocity and particle mass loading, on the cross-sectional distribution of the particle concentration in different pipe elements. It was furthermore found that the wall roughness has a considerable influence on the development of the particle concentration distribution.},

Predicted time-averaged particle concentrations and velocities reflect the classical core-annular flow structure in agreement with experimental measurements, in particular, with those reported by Miller and Gidaspow [AIChE J. 38 (1992) 1801]. Predicted instantaneous solids concentration frequencies compared well with the experimental data for various regions of the riser. Computed total granular temperature distributions in the riser qualitatively agree with experimental data. High thermal conductivities of fluidized powders (about 50 times that of the fluidizing gas) were estimated from the kinetic theory without adjusted parameters. Effects of initial conditions, inlet geometry, riser diameter and riser vertical inclination were assessed. Unexpected strong distortions of solids concentrations and vertical fluxes were predicted for small inclination angles of the order of 2◦. Analysis of experimental data should, therefore, be carefully conducted to ensure that riser inclination is not too important over the length of the riser in order to eliminate potential artifacts due to this geometric parameter.},

The multi-fluid model with gas phase and two particle phases of either different particle sizes or densities is used to simulate flows in bubbling gas-solids fluidized beds. The flow behavior of particle mixing or separation in bubbling fluidized beds was numerically predicted. Details of particle collision information were obtained through tracing particle motions based on Eulerian-Largarian approach coupled with the discrete hard-sphere t model. The distributions of volume fraction, velocity and granular temperature of particles of two different ip sizes or densities were obtained. The discrete hard-sphere modeling results quantified the granular r temperatures, particle fluctuating velocities, particle phase stresses, as well as the particle shear viscosities. sc The simulations using both the multi-fluid model and the discrete hard-sphere model clearly indicate u particle separation phenomenon in the fluidized beds, where relatively larger or heavier particles are n observed near the bed bottom than at the bed top region while relatively smaller or lighter particles were a found at bed top than at the bed bottom.

The numerical predictions from the discrete particle code are found to be in better agreement with the experimental findings, but the multifluid code is by far the most efficient. To evaluate the modelling of collisions in the multifluid model, discrete particle simulations which only take into account of energy loss caused by head-on collisions are compared with discrete particle simulations, which take nonfrontal collisions into account.},

  abstract      = {To mitigate climate change, it is of utmost importance to develop innovative, energy-efficient technologies to capture CO2. In this context, this study is envisioned as an exploration of opportunities by proposing an intensified CO2 capture process in a novel immobilized enzyme structured packed-bed microreactor (IE-SPB\ensuremath{\mu}R) with human carbonic anhydrase II (hCA II) enzyme attached on open-cell foam packings, which constitutes a promising alternative for mass-transfer-limited reactions. Enzyme-mediated CO2 uptake and fluid dynamics in IE-SPB\ensuremath{\mu}R were analyzed for different microreactor operating conditions and enzyme loadings, and using different buffer systems, via a 3D two-phase flow model coupled with governing equations of mass transport in gas/liquid phases and diffusion/reaction within the enzymatic catalyst layer. The results showed that IE-SPB\ensuremath{\mu}R generates a remarkable intensification of CO2 uptake at low hCA II enzyme loadings due to enhanced mass transfer over large interfacial areas that allow greater use of the large hCA II enzyme turnover while, at the same time, maintaining low pressure losses. The performance of IE-SPB\ensuremath{\mu}R is significantly enhanced by increasing liquid flow rate, decreasing pore diameter of foam packing, operating with buffers with low dissociation constant of protonated form and widening packed bed height while preserving pressure drop at low levels. An important advantage is that the pressure drop in IE-SPB\ensuremath{\mu}R with selected open-cell foam packings is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower, compared to packed-bed microreactors of similar specific surface area, thus allowing the process volume to be easily scaled-up by increasing the height of packed bed. The significant process intensification highlights the attractiveness of IE-SPB\ensuremath{\mu}Rs, connected in modular units, especially for capturing CO2 from dispersed sources.},

Flame stand-off distances for liquid interfaces near wet-bulb temperatures are predicted more accurately with variable properties.

  abstract      = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

The core behaves as a relatively uniform dilute flow, interspersed with infrequent particle structures. The number and density of these structures increases with radius. Maximum heterogeneity for high-density conditions occurs at some distance from the wall, unlike dilute risers where the flow is least uniform at the wall.

  abstract      = {Fluidized bed strippers play a significant role in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and fluid coking hydrocarbon processing operations. In the FCC process, the catalyst particles retained by the reactor cyclones contain substantial product hydrocarbon vapors. Failure to remove these vapors from the catalyst results in the loss of valuable products and undesirably high temperatures in the regenerator. In FCC applications, entrained and adsorbed hydrocarbon vapors are typically removed from the catalyst in a fluidized bed stripper using steam. In a fluid coker stripper, steam is propelled upwards to remove entrained and adsorbed hydrocarbons from the coke particles downflowing from the fluid coker reactor, thereby minimizing the carry-under of valuable hydrocarbon product. For both applications, several different proprietary and standard baffles have been used in these fluidized bed strippers. The most prevalent types of baffles are disk and donut trays, grating trays, horizontal sheds, and structured packings. This review summarizes studies available in the open literature on fluidized bed strippers as applied to the FCC and fluid coker unit operations. Overall, fluid catalytic cracking strippers, in particular disk and donut strippers, have received the most attention due to their much wider industrial usage. In past studies, experimental efforts have been dedicated to stripping efficiencies of various internals as a function of solids mass flux and stripping gas velocity, as well as stripper flooding and other flow dynamics issues. Typical commercial stripper operating problems have been pointed out, and methods to diagnose the problems have been identified. Fundamental theories on mass transfer in strippers are lacking.},

The amounts of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the foam on the surface of the fluid tank were measured. TAG increased during the first 20\,min after the start of circulation without additional coagulants and pH adjustment. The disruption of cells was achieved simultaneously. The amounts of TAG in the culture fluids at weeks 2 and 3 were higher than those at week 1.

However, as the number of X increases, many more simulations are required to search for the optimal X values. Furthermore, multiple objective variables Y, such as yields, make the optimization problem difficult. We propose a process design method based on adaptive design of experiments and Bayesian optimization. Selection of X values that satisfy the target values of multiple Y variables are searched, and simulations for the selected X values are then repeated. Therefore, the X will be selected by a small number of simulations. We verify the effectiveness of this method by simulating an ethylene oxide production plant.},

To enhance the process of methanol production from CO2 and H2 and reduce its cost, a particle-resolved numerical simulation tool is presented. A global surface reaction model based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson kinetics is utilized. The approach is first validated against standard benchmark problems for non-reacting and reacting cases. Next, the method is applied to study the performance of methanol production in a 2D fixed-bed reactor under a range of parameters. It is found that methanol yield enhances with pressure, catalyst loading, reactant ratio, and packing density. The yield diminishes with temperature at adiabatic conditions, while it shows non-monotonic change for the studied isothermal cases. Overall, the staggered and the random catalyst configurations are found to outperform the in-line system.},

A fluidized bed calciner offers a high heat transfer coefficient and requires low gas flow rates for operation. The design of such a reactor is studied in this work. It is not possible to fluidize raw meal directly, so a binary mixture of coarse lime particles and fine raw meal is used. The commercial Barracuda CPFD software is applied. The model was first validated against experimental results and then used to find an optimized design. The results indicate that the suggested pilot-scale fluidized bed calciner can operate between 10 and 16~t/h of raw meal feeding with a calcination degree above 90\% and with negligible coarse particle entrainment. The calciner needs 0.05–0.09~kg-CO2/kg-raw-meal for the operation, so the required gas recycling is low. Overall the calciner operation is smooth, and such a design could be used for electrification combined with CCUS.},

The technology may be described now as mature and competitive to common pulverized fuel firing systems. The fluidized-bed combustion development has reached a crucial phase which can be characterized by the following key points: (1)Technical problems could be solved by exchange of experience. (2)The electricity and heat requirement is stagnating in some industrialised countries. (3)The requirement of an additional flue gas cleaning system may offset an essential FBC advantage. (4)Economic comparison between FBC and pulverized fuel firing systems show advantages for the former in most cases.

(6)The state-of-the-art unit size is some 800 MWth. In future more power plants within the medium size of 200–500MWe will be needed.

This work focuses on the optimization of major emulsification process variables including sonication time, applied power and surfactant concentration. The effects of these variables were investigated on the basis of mean droplet diameter and stability of the prepared emulsion. It was found that the stable emulsion with droplet diameters about 160.9nm could be formed with the surfactant concentration of 10mg/ml and treated at 40\% of applied power (power density: 0.61W/ml) for 15min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of the emulsion droplets. The droplets were solid at room temperature, showing bright spots under polarized light and a spherical shape under SEM. The electrophoretic properties of emulsion droplets showed a negative zeta potential due to the adsorption of head sulfate groups of the SDS surfactant. For the sake of comparison, paraffin wax emulsion was prepared via emulsion inversion point method and was checked its intrinsic stability. Visually, it was found that the emulsion get separated/creamed within 30min. while the emulsion prepared via ultrasonically is stable for more than 3 months. From this study, it was found that the ultrasound-assisted emulsification process could be successfully used for the preparation of stable paraffin wax nanoemulsions.},

Just consider how sand can stream through the orifice of an hourglass  yet support one's weight on the beach; how it can form patterns  strikingly similar to a liquid when vibrated, yet respond to stirring  by ``unmixing'' of large and small grains. Despite much effort,  there still is no comprehensive understanding of other forms of matter,  like ordinary fluids or solids. In what way, therefore, is granular  matter special, and what makes it so difficult to understand?

  abstract      = {The present study investigates the effects of the geometric properties of porous media on fluid flows and uses a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning (ML) methods to develop new models for predicting the coefficients in the Forchheimer equation (\ensuremath{\Delta}P/L\,=\,\ensuremath{\alpha}v\,+\,\ensuremath{\beta}v2). For this purpose, CFD simulations are performed to assess the effects of foam structural properties on fluid flows for each of the 217 foam types tested. In this research, the Voronoi tessellation method is used to investigate such foam physical properties as porosity, pore diameter, strut diameter, and specific surface area. In all the simulations, air is used as the fluid entering the metallic foams at different superficial velocities but at a constant temperature of 300~K. Pressure gradient as well as Darcy (\ensuremath{\alpha}) and non-Darcy (\ensuremath{\beta}) flow coefficients are then calculated for each foam using the equation and the simulation results. It is shown that the values thus obtained strongly depend on the geometric properties of the porous medium. A second aspect of the study involves resolving the problems of the computation cost due to the complex geometries of foams that result in too many computational grids in the proposed method. This was addressed via machine learning (ML) regression models to develop a continuous model based on foam intrinsic properties. In this approach, models are proposed for estimating \ensuremath{\alpha} and \ensuremath{\beta} coefficients to be used in calculating pressure drop in different metallic foams. The results show that the ridge regularization regression and ordinary least squares are robust models for predicting the coefficients based on foam geometric properties. Moreover, the model is capable of calculating both the values for Reynolds number and friction factor in the continuous range, whereby the flow type can also be determined. Finally, the results obtained from the models indicate the efficacy of the proposed approach for the study of fluid flows in large-scale porous media with minimum errors and satisfactory accuracy.},

The work represents a novel step in the development of PINNs for phase change scenarios where surface tension effects dominate, and acts as a necessary validation stage before PINN techniques can be applied to complex boiling analysis. Initially, a forward analysis was performed using water and R-134a as working fluids. For each of these investigations, the PINN algorithm was trained on 50 \% of the available CFD data. The proposed algorithm was able to accurately infer velocity fields, particularly in the near-interfacial region. The resultant circulatory flow was found to maintain the desired circular shape of the growing bubbles. As a result, when predicting the evolution of a water vapour bubble, the developed PINN algorithm produced a reduction in peak error by 0.87 \% compared to CFD reference data, and 3.42 \% reduction in peak error for prediction of the evolution of the R-134a vapour bubble. To test and optimise the transfer learning capabilities of the developed methodology, the evolution of an FC-72 vapour bubble in superheated FC-72 was predicted without supplying supporting observational data. For this scenario, the PINN algorithm produced a peak error within 1.3 \% of the unobserved CFD reference data. The proposed approach confirms the robustness of PINN methodologies as a method of solving phase-change problems where surface tension plays a pivotal, promising to expedite parametric studies in practice. This study represents a pioneering effort in the development of PINNs for phase change by applying the current algorithm to investigate bubble growth within superheated liquid domains, serving as a basis for the application of PINNs for boiling problems and as a benchmark for inverse training strategy.},

  abstract      = {Microfluidic devices often contain several phases. Their design can be supported by interface-resolving numerical simulations, requiring accurate methods and validated computer codes. Especially challenging are submillimetre air bubbles in water due to their large density contrast and dominance of surface tension. Here, we evaluate two numerical methods implemented in OpenFOAM⃝R , namely the standard solver interFoam with an algebraic volume-of-fluid method relying on a sharp interface representation and phaseFieldFoam relying on the phase-field method with diffuse interface representation. For a circular bubble in static equilibrium, we explore the impacts of uniform grid resolution and bubble size on bubble shape, mass conservation, pressure jump and spurious currents. While the standard interFoam solver exhibits excellent mass conservation with errors below 0.1\% on fine grids, it lacks the accuracy to predict reasonable physics for a bubble in microfluidic systems. At higher resolution, large spurious currents significantly displace and deform the bubble, which is oscillating with resolution dependent mode and frequency. Furthermore, the pressure jump is consistently underestimated by more than 10\%. The solver phaseFieldFoam suffers from much larger mass losses of up to 2\%, which decrease as the ratio between interface thickness and bubble diameter decreases provided the diffuse interface region is adequately resolved. Spurious currents are very low and the bubble remains circular preserving its initial position with an error in pressure jump below 1\%.},

This shift is driven by technological advances, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, sensor networks and Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and the availability of large amounts of data that can be exploited by these technologies. However, the adoption of AI technologies for I4.0 varies considerably among industry sectors. This article complements broader reviews of I4.0 by examining the specific applications of IAI in several industry sectors, highlighting the issues and concerns encountered in and across different industry sectors, and discussing potential solutions that have been introduced along with opportunities and challenges for adoption. In this article, we review the literature to identify common themes and concerns related to the adoption of AI technologies in the context of I4.0 in several industry sectors. AI solutions are discussed in the context of an AI adoption pipeline that spans data collection, processing, model construction, and interpretation of results. Our findings indicate that although different industries share common issues, the adopted solutions are often specific to a particular industry sector, which may be difficult to transfer to other sectors. Moreover, industry sectors may pursue different adoption strategies due to varying experience and maturity of AI practices. These findings may inform managers, practitioners, and decision-makers who are involved in the adaptation of Industry 4.0 transformation in their respective industry sectors.},

  abstract      = {This study explores the implementation of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to analyze turbulent flow in composite porous-fluid systems. These systems are composed of a fluid-saturated porous medium and an adjacent fluid, where the flow properties are exchanged across the porous-fluid interface. The segregated PINN model employs a novel approach combining supervised learning and enforces fidelity to flow physics through penalization by the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Two cases were simulated for this purpose: solid block, i.e. porous media with zero porosity, and porous block with a defined porosity. The effect of providing internal training data on the accuracy of the PINN predictions for prominent flow features, including flow leakage, channeling effect and wake recirculation was investigated. Additionally, L2 norm error, which evaluates the prediction accuracy for flow variables was studied. Furthermore, PINN training time in both cases with internal training data was considered in this study. Results showed that the PINN model predictions with second-order internal training data achieved high accuracy for the prominent flow features compared to the RANS data, within a 20\% L2 norm error of second-order statistics in the solid block case. In addition, for the porous block case, providing training data at the porous-fluid interface showed errors of 18.04\% and 19.94\% for second-order statistics, representing an increase in prediction accuracy by 7\% compared to without interface training data. The study elucidates the impact of the internal training data distribution on the PINN training in complex turbulent flow dynamics, underscoring the necessity of turbulent second-order statistics variables in PINN training and an additional velocity gradient treatment to enhance PINN prediction.},

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

It permits a characterization of the initial states for which the Boltzmann H theorem is violated. In particular, it is shown that: (a) Any monatomic system for which the equilibrium potential energy exceeds the minimum possible value possesses a continuum of initial states for which the approach to equilibrium takes place through an increase, rather than a decrease, in Boltzmann's H. (b) If the initial distribution of particles is spatially homogeneous and Maxwellian, the approach to equilibrium will take place through an increase (decrease) in the Boltzmann H, according as the initial potential energy is less (greater) than the equilibrium value. (c) A necessary condition for the H-theorem-violating phenomenon is that the approach to equilibrium takes place through a conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy; a sufficient condition requires also that the initial velocity distribution be sufficiently close to Maxwellian. (d) These H-theorem-violating conditions are readily attained experimentally; for example, the free expansion of oxygen gas at 160 \textdegree{}K and 45-atm pressure produces an experimentally realizable violation of the Boltzmann H theorem.},

Additionally, the progress of the numerical investigation of hot and vital issues is discussed, including cavitation inception, cloud cavitation inner structure and its formation mechanism, cavitation erosion, and cavitation noise. It is indicated that the Euler-Lagrange method can determine cavitation inception point better. For cloud cavitation, the Euler-Lagrange method can reveal the source of microbubbles and their distribution law inside the shedding cloud. This method also has advantages and great potential in assessing cloud cavitation-induced erosion and noise. With the ever-growing demands of cavitation simulation accuracy in basic research and engineering applications, how to improve the Euler-Lagrange method's stability and applicability is still an open problem. To further promote the application of this advanced CFD simulation technology in cavitation research, some key issues are to be solved and feasible suggestions are put forward for further work.},

The linear MV schemes rely on linearized model around an operating point and therefore, it is difficult to obtain high quality control. This paper uses a singular value decomposition method (N4SID) to obtain a state space model which is then reduced to a step model required by the MPC algorithm. Simulations on a detailed model [Chem.

In the current paper, the full life circle of MNBs was reviewed, from emerging MNBs generation approaches to the advanced characterization techniques, and finally to their recently booming applications. The MNBs generation techniques were classified into two categories: the chemical approaches (e.g., electrolysis and chemical reaction, etc.) and the physical approaches (e.g., cavitation, dispersion of gas, solution mixing, temperature alteration, EHD effect, etc.). As to MNBs characterization, both the static and dynamic characterization techniques were discussed, e.g., optical microscope, high-speed photography, rheology, AFM, DLS, NTA, optical flow cytometry, electron microscope, etc., depending on their operating principles. Merits and demerits of those generation and characterization techniques for MNBs were compared and highlighted, as well as their own characteristics and application scopes. The burgeoning applications of MNBs in functional material preparation were subsequently reviewed in details, including material preparation mechanism, properties and application scenarios. While, the MNBs-based surface cleaning, hydrogen production and carbon neutrality were also emphasized. With the development of basic MNBs theory and the booming scientific and industrial demands, the MNBs-related science and technology will flourish, and MNBs will certainly exhibit broader application prospects in the near future.},

  abstract      = {Rechargeable lithium–ion batteries (LIBs) have improved significantly over the past 20 years; however, the micro-scale working mechanism of these batteries, especially the influence of electrode microstructures on battery performance, still requires further study. The relationship between the electrode microstructure and battery performance is studied in detail by developing a two-dimensional (2D) lattice Boltzmann model to reveal the ion and electron transport within an LIB porous electrode. The present model is established by using randomly reconstructed electrode geometry and the coupling of the electrochemical reaction and ion and electron transport under complex boundary conditions. The influences of the micro-scale morphological features of the battery electrode on the local lithium concentration distribution, electric potential and macroscopic discharge performance are revealed. The randomness of the particle distribution and particle shape result in a heterogeneous distribution of the lithium concentration and electrode potential. In electrode particles, lithium exchanges are enhanced for small particles and improved at the edges and corners for large irregular particles. Regions with low lithium concentration produce a high electric potential. A large particle size and low porosity in an anode improve battery performance. Likewise, a small particle size and high porosity in a cathode also improve battery performance.},

The reaction kinetic model was constructed with the equation oriented method, using the orthogonal collocation method to transform the differential equations of the kinetic model into algebraic equations with variables. The sequential quadratic programming method is used to solve the equation oriented model in this study. The validation results showed that the good agreement of material compositions and catalyst coke content at the exit of the fourth reactor, as well as the temperature and pressure at the exit of each reactor, was obtained between simulated values and industrial values. Moreover, the reactor kinetic model is also used to predict the influence of process parameters which is consistent with the trend in actual industrial production.

  abstract      = {Chromatography is a significant separation and analysis method widely used in analytical chemistry and biochemistry. A chromatographic system contains a mobile phase and a stationary phase, where the commonly utilized stationary phase is constructed by randomly packed particles. It has been verified by experiments that the usage of ordered structure for the stationary phase, would improve separation performance. However, due to the long time required for experiments and simulation procedures, there were only a few types of ordered structures evaluated for the chromatography system. This work is to investigate the correlation between column separation performance and ordered morphologies, for figuring out ordered structures with optimal chromatographic performance. Machine learning (ML) technology was applied in this work for finding optimal structures. This method was firstly employed for packing quality analysis of around 25000 experiments of pre-packed columns manufactured for a period of over 10 years. The capability of the ML model was validated to offer predictions of column performance with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) equal to around 10\% for reduced height equivalent to a theoretical plate (ℎ) and 7\% for peak asymmetry (Aₛ).Also, the model quantitatively indicated that column backbones were the most influential factor for pre-packed column quality. This work proved the capability of ML to evaluate and predict column performance. To generate large amounts of ordered structures, an algorithm was developed in two-dimensional (2D) chromatography. 2D morphologies were considered as a combination of discrete elements, where each element can be defined as a portion of the mobile phase or the stationary phase. Then these discrete elements were transformed into numbers 0 and 1 (corresponding to the mobile phase and stationary phase) in the matrix, in which case they can be controlled and altered easily. The total number of possible topologies as well as the demand for computing resources increase exponentially. Thus three types of constraints (principal pathway, symmetry constraint, and porosity constraint) were implemented into the algorithm to reduce the number of generated topologies. The reduction capability of constraints was evaluated and 97\% of possible topologies were reduced. These constraints served as a strong method to reduce the time and required computing resources to examine the possible ordered morphologies. The column separation performance was investigated by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. A large amount of 2D ordered pillar arrays and some discrete unit cells generated by algorithm and constraints were simulated. Based on the simulations of discrete unit cells, it was proven that the chromatographic performance was strongly affected by the homogeneity velocity profiles within the chromatography system. Structures, such as square and hexagon pillar arrays, having homogenous fluid profiles tended to provide high separation efficiency. In such case, pore-throat ratio, a commonly used parameter in stratigraphy analysis, was proposed for the homogeneity analysis of chromatographic bed due to the strong correlation with column performance and easiness in the determination by experiments. The practicality of pore-throat ratio was proven by the analysis of 2-dimensional (2D) pillar arrays and 3-dimensional (3D) triply periodic minimum surface (TPMS) monoliths. ML methods were then applied to the data set of 2D pillar arrays. The accuracy of the ML model was validated for the prediction of van Deemter curves (smaller than 10\% MAPE in general). For seeking the optimal morphologies of 2D pillar arrays, a reinforcement learning system was developed. The particle shape, particle size, and particle radial stretching were selected as the design freedom parameters of optimal pillar arrays. Six example morphologies were suggested by the reinforcement learning system, whose performances were all verified by CFD simulations. The CFD model was further developed with film diffusion, pore diffusion, and adsorption/desorption models considered, to investigate the solute behavior in the porous stationary phase. Considering pore diffusion and adsorption/desorption equilibrium, a comprehensive version of governing equations for different conditions is established with a definition of effective Peclet number. For different model conditions, the corresponding effective Peclet number can be written as a combination of three parts, the original Peclet number Pₑ,  the length scale of solid phase and fluid phase (L/Lₛ)\ensuremath{^2} and the system coefficient yₐ. With the definition of yₐ, , the model considering pore diffusion can also be utilized for simulations of pore diffusion and adsorption isotherms. Based on the simulations, it is confirmed that the optimized structures, suggested by machine learning, still maintain the performance superiority for the beds with the porous stationary phase. Overall, this work demonstrates, for the first time, the seeking process of optimal morphologies in chromatography by CFD simulations and ML. The 2D morphologies suggested by the ML tool were validated to have high purification performance. This method is required to be further developed for the 3D morphologies and porous stationary systems in the future. Nevertheless, the presented approach proves that it is possible to search optimal structures of chromatography columns by CFD modeling and ML. It is expected in the future, the purification performance of chromatography will be further enhanced with optimized ordered structures found by ML.},

However, inherent turbulence and multiphase interactions challenges the simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. In response, increasing attention has been paid to machine learning algorithms to enhance fluid dynamics simulations. This work develops a reduced-order model (ROM) to simulate solid-liquid flows in a stirred tank, which uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to learn the flow patterns from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The study investigates the impact of mode numbers and design points. The results show that the use of the ROM can result in a reduction of computation time of up to three orders of magnitude with reasonable accuracy. This study contributes by offering an exploration into extending ROM to multiphase flows, with a particular focus on solid-liquid mixing processes.},

Accordingly, the deep neural network was trained to accurately predict local bubble properties, where the inputs were determined by performing correlation analysis and a random forest algorithm. We found Reynolds number, voidage, and relative coordinates are the dominant factors, and a four-variable choice was demonstrated to output satisfactory performance for predicting local bubble diameter and velocity.

The computed energy spectrum captures the observed gravity wave and the Kolmogorov -5/3 law at high frequencies. The computed turbulent kinetic energy is close to the measurements for FCC particles. The CFD simulations compared reasonably well with the measured core-annular flow experiments at very high solid fluxes. The computed granular temperatures, solids pressures, FCC viscosities and frequencies of oscillations were close to measurements reported in the literature. The computations suggest that unlike for the flow of group B particles, the oscillations for the FCC particles in the center of the riser are primarily due to the oscillations of clusters and not due to oscillations of individual particles. Hence mixing is not on the level of individual particles.},

  abstract      = {The storage silo of a sugar refinery was designed by its manufacturer for a plug-flow pattern of sugar ingots in order to ensure effective drying of the sugar introduced at the top of the silo. Because of the excessive moisture content of the extracted ingots, the quality of flow within the silo was called into question. The silo flow-pattern was thus studied by introducing sugar lumps as a tracer at the top of the silo filled with ingots. The tracer weight percentage was measured at the outlet. Results show that the silo flow-pattern is not of the plug-flow type in its whole volume: after formation of a crater, only the central volume flows, while the outer residual volume remains motionless. The tracer test also enabled the detection of preferential flow patterns. The tracer method was found to be quite useful as a diagnosis method for such a device in normal functioning.},

  abstract      = {In chemical-looping combustion (CLC) a gaseous fuel is burnt with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The oxygen is transported from the combustion air to the fuel by means of metal oxide particles acting as oxygen carriers. A CLC system can be designed similar to a circulating fluidized bed, but with the addition of a bubbling fluidized bed on the return side. Thus, the system consists of a riser (fast fluidized bed) acting as the air reactor. This is connected to a cyclone, where the particles and the gas from the air reactor are separated. The particles fall down into a second fluidized bed, the fuel reactor, and are via a fluidized pot-seal transported back into the riser. The gas leaving the air reactor consists of nitrogen and unreacted oxygen, while the reaction products, carbon dioxide and water, come out from the fuel reactor. The water can easily be condensed and removed, and the remaining carbon dioxide can be liquefied for subsequent sequestration. The gas leakage between the reactors must be minimized to prevent the carbon dioxide from being diluted with nitrogen, or to prevent carbon dioxide from leaking to the air reactor decreasing the efficiency of carbon dioxide capture. In this system, the possible gas leakages are: (i) from the fuel reactor to the cyclone and to the pot-seal, (ii) from the cyclone down to the fuel reactor, (iii) from the pot-seal to the fuel reactor. These gas leakages were investigated in a scaled cold model. A typical leakage from the fuel reactor was 2\%, i.e. a CO2 capture efficiency of 98\%. No leakage was detected from the cyclone to the fuel reactor. Thus, all product gas from the air reactor leaves the system from the cyclone. A typical leakage from the pot-seal into the fuel reactor was 6\%, which corresponds to 0.3\% of the total air added to the system, and would give a dilution of the CO2 produced by approximately 6\% air. However, this gas leakage can be avoided by using steam, instead of air, to fluidize the whole, or part of, the pot-seal. The disadvantages of diluting the CO2 are likely to motivate the use of steam. D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The numerical results are compared to experiments by means of power spectral density distributions of fluctuating pressure signals and bubble statistics obtained from capacitance probe measurements. Two different particle rheology models are tested in combination with two different values of the maximum particle volume fraction. The first particle model predicts the particle pressure by an exponential power law and assumes a constant particle viscosity (CPV), and the second model predicts the stresses using the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). Furthermore, two model approaches for the air inflow are evaluated. The first inflow model includes the coupling between the air-feed system and the fluidized bed in the simulation, and the second model assumes a constant mass flow of gas into the fluidized bed. Finally, the influence of the compressibility of the gas phase on the numerical predictions is investigated. The numerical simulations are made using the CFX-4.4 commercial flow solver.},

A continuously operated laboratory reactor system for chemical-looping combustion with two interconnected fluidized beds was designed and built. This chemical-looping combustor was designed to operate with a fuel flow corresponding to 100–300 W. The CLC system was operated successfully using a highly reactive nickel-based oxygen-carrier. Furthermore, tests were carried out to determine the degree of gas leakage between the reactors. Although there was some leakage between the fuel and air reactors, it is low enough to enable evaluation of the combustion results. The combustion tests showed a high conversion of the natural gas to carbon dioxide, indicating that the particles are suitable for chemical-looping combustion. No methane was detected in the gas from the fuel reactor, and the fraction of carbon monoxide was in the range 0.5–3\%.},

  abstract      = {This work compares time, frequency and state-space analyses of pressure measurements from fluidized beds. The experiments were carried out in a circulating fluidized bed, operated under ambient conditions and under different fluidization regimes. Interpretation of results in time domain, such as standard deviation of the pressure fluctuations, may lead to erroneous conclusions about the flow regime. The results from the frequency domain (power spectra) and state-space analyses (correlation dimension, DML, and Kolmogorov entropy, KML, together with a non-linearity test) of the pressure fluctuations are generally in agreement and can be used complementary to each other. The power spectra can be divided into three regions, a region corresponding to the macro-structure (due to the bubble flow) and, at higher frequencies, two regions representing finer structures that are not predominantly governed by the macro structure of the flow. In all fluidization regimes, the measured pressure fluctuations exhibited an intermittent structure, which is not revealed by power spectral analysis of the original signals. Fluctuations with pronounced peaks in the power spectrum and in the auto-correlation function, corresponding to passage of single bubbles through the bed, are non-linear with a low dimension (DML{$<$}5.5). For DML{\$<\$}5.5, the Kolmogorov entropy is proportional to the amount of energy in the spectral range of the intermittent structures observed, whereas for DML{\$>\$}5.5 both KML (bits/cycle) and DML are insensitive to changes in the distribution of energy in power spectra. Thus, the state-space analysis reflects that non-linearity is mostly found in the macro-structure of the flow.

This contribution highlights the additional feature that hydrogenation of the LOHC compound dibenzyltoluene with technical relevant H2/CO2 gas mixtures (up to 30 \% CO2) gives access to hydrogen purification and hydrogen storage in one single process step. Alumina supported Rh and Pd catalysts proved to be especially suitable for this task. The rhodium catalysts enabled efficient aromatics hydrogenation in the temperature range of 120 \textdegree{}C to 150 \textdegree{}C with moderate methane formation (CH4/CO2{$<$}0.1 at 150 \textdegree{}C). The palladium catalyst showed the lowest selectivity to methane formation (CH4/CO2{\$<\$}0.1 at 270 \textdegree{}C) and promising hydrogenation activity at temperatures above 200 \textdegree{}C even in the presence of CO and CO2.},

The process is composed of two interconnected fluidized bed reactors. The air reactor which is a conventional circulating fluidized bed and the fuel reactor which is a bubbling fluidized bed. The basic principle is to avoid the direct contact of air and fuel during the combustion by introducing a highly-reactive metal particle, referred to as oxygen carrier, to transport oxygen from the air to the fuel. In the process, the products from combustion are kept separated from the rest of the flue gases namely nitrogen and excess oxygen. This process eliminates the energy intensive step to separate the CO2 from nitrogen-rich flue gas that reduce the thermal efficiency.},

The advantage of the presented fluid bed calcination technology is the possibility of the continuous operation of the reactor and the short time of the material in the bed, compared to the previously used methods of calcination in a shaft and rotary kiln, which lasts less than twenty minutes in the temperature range of 650–850 \textdegree{}C. During the experimental studies of calcination in the fluidized bed layer, the influence of the type of coal, its particle size and the mass share of coal in the feed mixture on the calcination process and the final product obtained was analysed. As a result of the conducted research, it was proven that solid fuels such as anthracite and steam coal type 31.2 (flaming) can be successfully used in the fluidized bed calcination process of clay materials. The key parameter determining the fluidized bed calcination process is the fuel particle distribution.},

For hydrogen release on board of heavy-duty vehicles, however, the limited volumetric power density of the hydrogen release units was so far seen as a critical factor. Herein, we show that the power density achieved in perhydro benzyltoluene dehydrogenation in a classical fixed-bed dehydrogenation reactor can be doubled by applying an inverted multi-tubular reactor with upstream LOHC flow and hydrogen release in the reactor housing and crossflow heating through perpendicular heating tubes. The resulting power densities of up to 0.76kWH2-LHV L-1reactor-outside (with respect to the total reactor housing), and 2.34kWH2-LHV L-1reactor-inside (with respect to inner reactor volume) bring on-board hydrogen release of LOHC-bound hydrogen much closer to technical reality. This very impressive increase in power density is mainly due to the fact, that the inverted arrangement of catalyst bed and heat transfer tubes offers a much higher catalyst volume per reactor volume compared to a classical fixed-bed reactor.},

A favourable feature of EDAC is the purely parabolic type of governing equations resulting from the introduction of a damping term to the pressure evolution equation. This significantly reduces noise in the velocity divergence field when central schemes are applied for the spatial discretisation. The method of lines is used for the solution of the EDAC equations. A conservative finite difference method of purely 2nd- and mixed 4th/2nd-order is applied. The explicit 4th-order, six-stage lowstorage Runge–Kutta method is used for time advancement. As expected, the mixed scheme is superior to the 2nd-order one in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

The purpose of this paper is to show how the threshold velocities can be used to design of particle--fluid systems for particle size distribution. The analysis provides practical guides for various engineering scenarios, such as selecting the appropriate fluidization velocity for maximum fluidization and minimum entrainment and determining the conveying velocity in pneumatic systems. In addition, the analysis provides a guide to determine whether the deposited layer of particles at the pipe bottom is stationary or moving, for cases where the superficial velocity is smaller than the saltation velocity.},

The DSMC algorithm has been modified and extended to account for bubble-bubble interactions arising due to uncorrelated and correlated bubble velocities. The algorithm is fully coupled with an in-house CFD code and parallelized using the MPI framework. The model is verified and validated on multiple cores with different test cases, ranging from impinging particle streams to laboratory-scale bubble columns. The parallel performance is shown using two different large scale systems: with an uniform and a non-uniform distribution of bubbles. The hydrodynamics of a pilot-scale bubble column is analyzed and the effect of the column scale is reported via the comparison of bubble columns at three different scales.},

Low-temperature plasmas are often used for surface processes like cleaning, activating or coating. A circulating fluidised bed (CFB) for plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) on powders is introduced here. A low-temperature plasma is generated in a riser tube by coupling microwaves. As a model application, NaCl crystals were coated with a thin silicon oxide film and the deposition rate was measured. Since a similar treatment time for each particle is crucial for a homogeneous coating, the residence time distribution (RTD) in the reactor is estimated. It is shown that the process temperature can be easily adjusted to very low values. The data presented allows the design of industrial plasma processes on powders with similar electromagnetic properties. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

In recent years, use of inexpensive and abundantly available biosorbents generated from fibrous plant-based food-waste materials to remove heavy metals has garnered considerable research attention. The aim of this review is to investigate the applicability of using fibrous plant-based food waste, which comprises different components such as pectin, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, to remove heavy metals from wastewater. This contribution confirms that plant-fiber-based food waste has the potential to bind heavy metals from wastewater and aqueous solutions. The binding capacities of these biosorbents vary depending on the source, chemical structure, type of metal, modification technology applied, and process conditions used to improve functionalities. This review concludes with a discussion of arguments and prospects, as well as future research directions, to support valorization of fibrous plant-based food waste as an efficient and promising strategy for water purification.},

In the case of partial heat penetration, the heat flux applied to the wall side of the clusters has not reached its bed-side, while in the case of total heat penetration the heat flux has completely crossed the cluster, and the temperature of its bed-side would differ from the bed temperature. Based on the heat balance equation inside the cluster, two different expressions were derived for heat transfer coefficient for each penetration period.

  abstract      = {The primary method of large scale hydrogen production is steam methane reforming (SMR) in the packed bed reactors filled with the catalysts. In these reactors, heat is mostly supplied through the reactor wall to compensate for the endothermic effect of SMR reactions. In this paper, an alternative route of steam methane reforming process over a preheated packed bed filled with Ni-based catalyst particles was studied. Consequent packed bed heating with hot flue gas and cooling with H2O - CH4 endothermically reacting mixture was investigated. Numerical model has been developed for the cooling and heating processes and realized via Ansys Fluent. The analyses were performed for various steam-to-methane ratios and different initial temperature distributions. Results are indicating that the packed bed volume averaged temperature increases by 98 \textdegree{}C after 15 s of heating with flue gas. Packed bed cools down by more than 125 \textdegree{}C after 15 s of the SMR process. Mixture species distribution was also analysed along the reformer length. Hydrogen outlet molar fraction constantly decreases from 0.38 to 0.25 at the process beginning and end, respectively. The highest hydrogen production was observed on the half of the packed bed closer to the reformer outlet.},

  abstract      = {Data-driven synthesis planning with machine learning is a key step in the design and discovery of novel inorganic compounds with desirable properties. Inorganic materials synthesis is often guided by heuristics and chemists' prior knowledge and experience, built upon experimental trial-and-error that can be both time and resource consuming. Recent developments in natural language processing have enabled large-scale text mining of scientific literature, providing open-source databases of synthesis information on realized compounds, material precursors, and reaction conditions (temperatures, times). We employ supervised classification machine learning (ML) models to distinguish between solid-state, sol–gel, and solution (hydrothermal, precipitation) synthesis routes based on specified reaction target material and/or precursor materials. We demonstrate regression ML models that are able to predict suitable temperatures and times for the crucial inorganic synthesis steps of calcination and sintering given the reaction target and precursor materials. We contrast this regression-based condition modeling with a conditional variational autoencoder neural network that can generate appropriate distributions for the synthesis conditions of interest. We evaluate model interpretability using the Shapley additive explanations approach to gain insight into factors influencing suitability of synthesis route and reaction conditions. We find that the aforementioned models are capable of learning subtle differences in target material composition, precursor compound identities, and choice of synthesis route that are present in the inorganic synthesis space. Moreover, they generalize well to unseen chemical entities, outperform common heuristics in the field, and show promise for predicting appropriate reaction routes and conditions for previously unsynthesized compounds of interest.},

These two approaches are supplemented with appropriate closure equations that take into account all the pertinent forces and interaction effects on the solid particles, such as: particleturbulence interactions; turbulence modulation; particle-particle interactions; particle-wall interactions; gravitation, drag and lift forces. The two methods have been used in order to simulate the turbulent particulate flow in upward pipes. The flow domain in all cases was a cylindrical pipe and the computations were carried for upward pipe flow. Monodisperse as well as polydisperse mixtures of particles have been considered. In general, the average velocity results obtained from the two methods are in close agreement, because the methods predict well the average velocity distribution of the carrier fluid as well as the solids. Thus, the differences in the average axial velocities predicted by the methods are not substantial. Differences in the turbulence intensity are more significant. A comparison of the numerical results obtained shows the relative importance of retaining the diffusion terms in both the axial and radial directions in the RANS method. Also the comparisons of the results show the relative effect of the lift forces in the distribution of solid particles.},

In these experiments, a light diode assembly was utilized to infer the local solids volume fractions within a rectangular bed of 10 nm silica particles. These experimental measurements yielded a two dimensional solids volume fraction distribution within the rectangular bed. The experimental results provided some new insights into the distribution of solids within the bed. The agglomerate diameters were computed using a momentum balance with the drag given by the Ergun equation and the empirical Richardson–Zaki method. Both methods yielded agglomerate diameters of the order of 100 \ensuremath{\mu}m and showed dependence on the strength of the electric field.

When gas flow is more than the minimum fluidization velocity, the top of the fluidized bed may fluctuate vigorously leading to unstable operation. Bed fluctuation and fluidization quality are interrelated. The quality of fluidization can largely be improved by introducing baffles in bubbling and turbulent fluidized beds. In the present work three baffle geometries, i.e., circular, triangular and square are used to determine different hydrodynamic parameters such as minimum fluidization velocity, bed expansion, pressure drop across the bed, fluctuation ratio, expansion ratio, etc. in a bubbling fluidized bed. A new parameter blockage ratio is introduced to analyze the behaviour of baffled fluidized beds. It is found from the current experimental studies that the blockage ratio mainly influences the hydrodynamics of the bed rather than the shape of the baffle.},

In this work, two concepts for a technical implementation of the electron beam plasma pyrolysis in a large-scale hydrogen production plant are presented and evaluated in regards of efficiency, economics and carbon footprint. The potential of this technology is identified by an assessment of the results with the benchmark technologies steam methane reforming, steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage as well as water electrolysis. The techno-economic analysis shows levelized costs of hydrogen for the plasma pyrolysis between 2.55~\mbox{\texteuro}{}/kg H2 and 5.00~\mbox{\texteuro}{}/kg H2 under the current economic framework. Projections for future price developments reveal a significant reduction potential for the hydrogen production costs, which support the profitability of plasma pyrolysis under certain scenarios. In particular, water electrolysis as direct competitor with renewable electricity as energy supply shows a considerably higher specific energy consumption leading to economic advantages of plasma pyrolysis for cost-intensive energy sources and a high degree of utilization. Finally, the carbon footprint assessment indicates the high potential for a reduction of life cycle emissions by electron beam plasma methane pyrolysis (1.9~kg CO2 eq./kg H2 – 6.4~kg CO2 eq./kg H2, depending on the electricity source) compared to state-of-the-art hydrogen production technology (10.8~kg CO2 eq./kg H2).},

We show that a chemistry-aware model, NERF, which mimics the bonding changes that occur during reactions, allows for highly accurate predictions of the outcomes of Diels–Alder reactions using a relatively small training set, with no pretraining and no additional features. We establish a diverse data set of 9537 intramolecular, hetero-, aromatic, and inverse electron demand Diels–Alder reactions. This data set is used to train a NERF model, and the performance is compared against state-of-the-art classification and generative machine learning models across low- and high-data regimes, with and without pretraining. The predictive accuracy (regio- and site selectivity in the major product) achieved by NERF exceeds 90\% when as little as 40\% of the data set is used for training. Another high-performing model, Chemformer, requires a larger training data set ({$>$}45\%) and pretraining to reach 90\% Top-1 accuracy. Accurate predictions of less-represented reaction subclasses, such as those involving heteroatomic or aromatic substrates, require higher percentages of training data. We also show how NERF can use small amounts of additional training data to quickly learn new systems and improve its overall understanding of reactivity. Synthetic chemists stand to benefit as this model can be rapidly expanded and tailored to areas of chemistry corresponding to the low-data regime.},

Various configurations of photocatalytic membrane reactors are described and characterized, including PMRs with photocatalysts immobilized on or in the membrane as well as reactors with suspended catalysts. Several types of photocatalysis-membrane reactor configurations are compared with respect to their permeate flux, membrane fouling, and permeate quality. The numerous variables that influence the performance of PMRs are described, such as the photocatalyst, wavelength, light intensity, temperature, pH, flow velocity, retention time, aeration, inorganic ions, initial pollutant concentration, reactor geometry and design, and membranes. Moreover, this work provides a short introduction to photocatalysis and membrane processes as unit operations. The integrative type of suspension PMR configuration was found to be the optimal configuration for treating industrial wastewater due to its high contaminant removal efficiency and low operation and design costs compared to other configurations.},

  abstract      = {Enhancing the efficiency of industrial water electrolysis for hydrogen production is important for the energy transition. In electrolysis, hydrogen is produced at the cathode, which forms bubbles due to the diffusion of dissolved hydrogen in the surrounding supersaturated electrolyte. Hydrogen (and oxygen) bubbles play an important role in the achievable electrolysis efficiency. The growth of the bubbles is determined by diffusive and convective mass transfer. In turn, the presence and the growth of the hydrogen bubbles affect the electrolysis process at the cathode. In the present study, we simulate the growth of a single hydrogen bubble attached to a vertical cathode in a 30 wt\% KOH solution in a cathodic compartment represented by a narrow channel. We solve the Navier–Stokes equations, mass transport equations and potential equation for a tertiary current distribution. A sharp interface immersed boundary method with an artificial compressibility method for the pressure is employed. To verify the numerical accuracy of the method, we performed a grid refinement study and checked the global momentum and hydrogen mass balances. We investigate the effects of flow rate and operation pressure upon bubble growth behaviour, species concentrations, potential and current density. We compare different cases in two ways: for the same time and for the same bubble radius. We observe that increasing the flow velocity leads to a small increase in efficiency. Increasing the operation pressure causes higher hydrogen density which slows down the bubble growth. For a given bubble radius, increasing the pressure leads to a small decrease in efficiency.},

We develop and use a sharp interface method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, the species transport equations, and the potential equation for a tertiary current distribution. To investigate the role of the mobility of the bubble interface, three different boundary conditions are used: the no-slip, the free-slip, and the Marangoni stress condition. The surface tension depends on the local electrolyte concentration. The simulation results show that different boundary conditions lead to minor changes in electrochemical quantities but significantly affect the force on the bubble. The Marangoni boundary condition leads to a relatively large force on the bubble, which is expected to accelerate bubble detachment. This result makes plausible why the hydrogen bubbles in alkaline electrolysis are relatively small.},

  abstract      = {Fibre suspensions in the fluid medium are common in industry, biology, and the environment. Industrial examples of concentrated suspensions include fresh concrete, uncured solid rocket fuel, and biomass slurries; natural examples include silt transfer in rivers and red blood cells in the blood. These suspensions often include a Newtonian fluid as their suspending medium; still, these suspensions exhibit a plethora of non-Newtonian properties, such as yield stresses, rate-dependent rheology, and normal stresses, to name a few. Other than volume fraction, the type of fiber material, the presence of fluid-fiber or fiberfiber interactions such as hydrodynamic, Brownian, colloidal, frictional, chemical, and/or electrostatic determine the rheological behavior of suspension. The average inter-fiber gaps between the neighboring fibers decrease significantly as the suspension volume fraction move towards a concentrated regime. As a result, in this regime, inter-fiber interactions become dominant. Moreover, the surface asperities are present on the fiber surface even in the case of so-called smooth fibers, as fibers in real suspensions are not perfectly smooth. Hence, contact forces arising from the direct touching of the fibers become one of the essential factors in determining the rheology of suspensions.We first describe the causes of yield stress, shear thinning, and normal stress differences in fibre suspensions. We model the fibers as inextensible continuous flexible slender bodies with the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation governing their dynamics suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid. The fiber dynamics and fluid flow coupling is achieved using the immersed boundary method (IBM). In addition, the fiber surface roughness lead to inter-fiber contacts resulting in normal and tangential forces between the fibers, which follow Coulomb's law of friction. The surface roughness is modeled as hemispherical protrusions on the fiber surfaces. In addition to the comparison of the computational model to the experimental results, we demonstrate that attractive interactions lead to yield stress and shear thinning rheology.Furthermore, we investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and volume fraction on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We find that the suspension viscosity increases with increasing the volume fraction, roughness, fiber rigidity, and aspect ratio. The increase in relative viscosity is the macroscopic manifestation of a similar increase in the microscopic contact contribution with these parameters. In addition, we observe positive and negative first and second normal stress differences, respectively, in agreement with previous experiments. Lastly, we propose a modified Maron-Pierce law to quantify the the jamming volume fraction with varying fiber aspect ratio and roughness. Additionally, we provide a constitutive model to calculate the viscosity at various volume fractions, aspect ratios, and shear rates.},

  abstract      = {We propose a constitutive model to predict the viscosity of fiber suspensions, which undergoes shear thinning, at various volume fractions, aspect ratios, and shear stresses/rates. We calibrate the model using the data from direct numerical simulation and prove the accuracy by predicting experimental measurements from the literature. We use a friction coefficient decreasing with the normal load between the fibers to quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed shear thinning in fiber suspensions. In this model, the effective normal contact force, which is directly proportional to the bulk shear stress, determines the effective friction coefficient. A rise in the shear stress reduces the effective friction coefficient in the suspension. As a result, the jamming volume fraction increases with the shear stress, resulting in a shear thinning in the suspension viscosity. Moreover, we extend the model to quantify the effects of fiber volume fraction and aspect ratio in the suspension. We calibrate this model using the data from numerical simulations for the rate-controlled shear flow. Once calibrated, we show that the model can be used to predict the relative viscosity for different volume fractions, shear stresses, and aspect ratios. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with the available experimental measurements from the literature. The findings of this study can potentially be used to tune the fiber size and volume fraction for designing the suspension rheology in various applications.},

Its primary aim is to uncover the CAD process behind a physical object given its 3D scan. We propose CAD-SIGNet, an end-to-end trainable and auto-regressive architecture to recover the design history of a CAD model represented as a sequence of sketch-and-extrusion from an input point cloud. Our model learns visual-language representations by layer-wise cross-attention between point cloud and CAD language embedding. In particular, a new Sketch instance Guided Attention (SGA) module is proposed in order to reconstruct the fine-grained details of the sketches. Thanks to its auto-regressive nature, CAD-SIGNet not only reconstructs a unique full design history of the corresponding CAD model given an input point cloud but also provides multiple plausible design choices. This allows for an interactive reverse engineering scenario by providing designers with multiple next-step choices along with the design process. Extensive experiments on publicly available CAD datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach against existing baseline models in two settings, namely, full design history recovery and conditional auto-completion from point clouds.},

Can J Chem Eng, 86(4): 622–634]: turbulent engulfment and mean drag. Baffling suppresses stable surface vortex formation and increases the intensity of mean drag and turbulence at the surface. Strong top to bottom liquid circulation is also promoted by baffling, however; this circulation rapidly brings particles back to the surface. In this paper, two alternate baffle configurations are proposed: half baffles and surface baffles. The objective is to maintain a high level of turbulence at the surface while reducing the return circulation from the bottom of the tank. The performance of the baffle configurations is compared using the just drawn down speed, Njd, and cloud depth, CD, for the PBTD, PBTU and A340 impellers. CFD simulations and measurements of the power number for the fully baffled and the surface baffled configurations are also reported. It is found that half baffles are very similar to full baffles in performance, but surface baffles offer several advantages: a significant reduction in Njd, more robust performance at large submergences, and a better distribution of solids.},

Achieving prolonged emulsion stability is challenging and depends on various factors, with particular emphasis on droplet size, shape, and spatial distribution. Addressing this issue necessitates an effective investigation of these parameters and finding solutions to enhance emulsion stability. Image analysis offers a powerful tool for researchers to explore these characteristics and advance our understanding of emulsion instability in different industries. In this review, we highlight the potential of state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches in computer vision and image analysis to extract relevant features from emulsion micrographs. A comprehensive summary of classic and cutting-edge techniques employed for characterizing spherical objects, including droplets and bubbles observed in micrographs of industrial emulsions, has been provided. This review reveals significant deficiencies in the existing literature regarding the investigation of highly concentrated emulsions. Despite the practical importance of these systems, limited research has been conducted to understand their unique characteristics and stability challenges. It has also been identified that there is a scarcity of publications in multimodal analysis and a lack of a complete automated in-line emulsion characterization system. This review critically evaluates the existing challenges and presents prospective directions for future advancements in the field, aiming to address the current gaps and contribute to the scientific progression in this area.},

  abstract      = {Flow behavior and flow regime transitions were determined in a circulating fluidized bed riser (0.203 m i.d. \texttimes{} 5.9 m high) of FCC particles (dp = 70 m, p = 1700 kg/m3). A momentum probe was used to measure radial profiles of solids momentum flux at several heights and to distinguish between local net upward and downward flow. In the experimental range covered (Ug = 5.8 m/s; Gs = 22.345 kg/m2 s), the fast fluidization flow regime was observed to coexist with dense suspension upflow (DSU). At a constant gas velocity, net downflow of solids near the wall disappeared towards the bottom of the riser with increasing solids mass flux, with dense suspension upflow achieved where there was no refluxing of solids near the riser wall on a time-average basis. The transition to DSU conditions could be distinguished by means of variations of net solids flow direction at the wall, annulus thickness approaching zero and flattening of the solids holdup versus Gs trend. A new flow regime map is proposed distinguishing the fast fluidization, DSU and dilute pneumatic transport flow regimes. ᭧ 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The thickness of the annular downflow layer based on DPm=0 reaches a maximum with increasing height. The annular downflow layer disappears locally with increasing solids mass flux ( Gs) at a constant gas velocity, with achievement of the dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime. A new correlation is developed to predict the time – mean thickness of solids down-flowing layer based on solids mass flux and momentum flux. It successfully accounts for the variation of the annular layer thickness with height and Gs, and covers a wide Gs range right up to near the onset of the DSU regime.},

The wake behind a particle, a particle size, the loading ratio and the density difference between two phases of a particle-laden flow were considered as significant parameters, which have an influence on the turbulence of a particle-laden flow, and the relative velocity of the laden particles was calculated by using a terminal velocity. The frictional pressure drop was formulated by using the force balance in the control volume by considering the shear stresses due to the presence of particles and an analogy of the shear stresses in the solid surfaces. The numerical results show a good agreement with the available experimental data and the model successfully predicted the mechanism of the pressure drop in the particle-laden flows.},

  abstract      = {Influences of configurations of solids feeding device and riser exit on the flow behaviors of gas–solid in a solids circulation system were studied in order to investigate a highly dense solids circulation at high velocity. Experiments were carried out in a lab-scale circulating fluidized bed (0.05 mID \texttimes{} 4.5 m-H) cold model with FCC particles (dp = 70 \ensuremath{\mu}m, \ensuremath{\rho}s = 1740 kg/m3) as a bed material. Three kinds of solids feeders (Loop-seal, J-valve and Lvalve type) and three different shapes of riser exits (C, L and T-shape) were employed. It was found that the solids mass flux (Gs) increased with increasing the primary gas velocity (U1) in all configurations, and the level of Gs with the L-valve was much higher than the other feeders and the high Gs enabled solids holdup (\ensuremath{\epsilon}s) in the riser to be relatively dense at high U1. Among the three riser exit configurations investigated (C, L and T-shape), on the other hand, C-shape exit provided high Gs and \ensuremath{\epsilon}s at high U1. In this study, a highly dense solids circulation was observed under conditions such as LV solids feeder and C-shape riser exit with sufficient solids inventory (Is). The effects of the inlet and exit configurations on the gas–solid flow behaviors from a dilute to a dense-phase were discussed based on correlation dimension (Dc) and Kolmogorov entropy (K) obtained by chaos analysis of pressure fluctuations.},

A geometry-grid template toolkit is developed to address the need to produce a large number of grids in a timely manner for the parametric design study. An objectoriented optimization toolkit that allows a flexible and extensible interfacing with user-specific codes is used. An in-house full Navier–Stokes flow solver is developed and used in the framework. Code integration is achieved using a black-box interface with script files.

The emulsions used for coating were produced by mixing a carnauba wax-based solution (18\%, w/w) with LO at various concentrations (0.5\% to 4.0\%, w/w) using dynamic high pressure processing at 172 MPa. The coatings were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 and their ability to preserve various physicochemical qualities of plums. Uniform and continuous coatings on plums, formed with stable emulsions, initially inhibited S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 by 0.2 to 2.8 and 0.8 to 2.7 log CFU/g, respectively, depending on the concentration of LO and the sequence of coating. The coatings did not significantly alter the flavor, fracturability, or glossiness of the plums. The antimicrobial effects of the coatings against S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 were demonstrated during storage at 4 and 25 \textdegree{}C. The coatings reduced weight loss and ethylene production by approximately 2 to 3 and 1.4 to 4.0 fold, respectively, and also retarded the changes in lightness and the concentration of phenolic compounds in plums during storage. The firmness of coated plums was generally higher than uncoated plums when stored at 4 \textdegree{}C and plum respiration rates were reduced during storage. Coatings containing nanoemulsions of LO have the potential to inhibit Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 contamination of plums and may extend plum shelf life.},

  abstract      = {Auto-generative high pressure digestion (AHPD) and hydrogen-injecting digestion (HID) have been introduced to directly produce high CH4-content biogas from anaerobic digester. However, each approach has its own technical difficulties (pH changes), and practical issues (high cost of H2) to obtain {$>$} 90\% CH4 containing biogas, particularly, from the high-strength waste like food waste (FW). To overcome this problem, in this study, AHPD and HID were integrated, which can offset each drawback but maximize its benefit. Substrate concentration of FW tested here was 200~g COD/L, the highest ever applied in AHPD and HID studies. At first, the reactor was operated by elevating the autogenerative pressure from 1 to 3, 5, and 7~bar without H2 injection. With the pressure increase, the CH4 content in the biogas gradually increased from 52.4\% at 1~bar to 77.4\% at 7~bar. However, a drop of CH4 production yield (MPY) was observed at 7~bar, due to the pH drop down to 6.7 by excess CO2 dissolution. At further operation, H2 injection began at 5~bar, with increasing its amount. The injection was effective to increase the CH4 content to 82.8\%, 87.2\%, and 90.6\% at 0.09, 0.13, and 0.18~L H2/g CODFW.fed of H2 injection amount, respectively. At 0.25~L H2/g CODFW.fed, there was a further increase of CH4 content to 92.1\%, but the MPY was dropped with pH increase to 8.7 with residual H2 being detected (4\% in the biogas). Microbial community analysis showed the increased abundance of piezo-tolerant microbe with pressure increase, and direct interspecies electron transfer contributors after H2 injection. In conclusion, the integration of two approaches enabled to directly produce high calorific biogas (90\% {\$>\$} CH4, 180~MJ/m3 biogas) from high-strength FW at the lowest requirement of H2 (0.18~L H2/g CODFW.fed) ever reported.},

Written with the practicing control engineer in mind, the book:  Brings together proven design methods, many of which have never been published before Focuses on techniques that have an immediate practical application Minimizes the use of daunting mathematics – but for the more demanding reader, complex mathematical derivations are included at the end of each chapter  Covers the use of all the algorithms, common to most distributed control systems  This book raises the standard of what might be expected of even basic controls. In addition to the design methods it describes any shortcuts that can be taken and how to avoid common pitfalls. Proper application will result in significant improvements to process performance. Myke King's practical approach addresses the needs of the process industry, and will improve the working practices of many control engineers. ``This book would be of value to process control engineers in any country.'' – Mr Andrew Ogden-Swift, Chairmain, Process Management and Control Subject Group, Institution of Chemical Engineers, UK ``This book should take the process-control world by storm.'' – Edward Dilley, Lecturer in Process Control, ESD Simulation Training},

  abstract      = {Distillation has historically been the main method for separating mixtures in the chemical process industry. However, despite the flexibility and widespread use of distillation processes, they still remain extremely energy inefficient. Increased optimization and novel distillation concepts can deliver substantial benefits, not just in terms of significantly lower energy use, but also in reducing capital investment and improving eco-efficiency. While likely to remain the separation technology of choice for the next few decades, there is no doubt that distillation technologies need to make radical changes in order to meet the demands of the energy-conscious society. Advanced Distillation Technologies: Design, Control and Applications gives a deep and broad insight into integrated separations using non-conventional arrangements, including both current and upcoming process intensification technologies.  It includes:  Key concepts in distillation technology Principles of design, control, sizing and economics of distillation Dividing-wall column (DWC) – design, configurations, optimal operation and energy efficient and advanced control DWC applications in ternary separations, azeotropic, extractive and reactive distillation Heat integrated distillation column (HIDiC) – design, equipment and configurations Heat-pump assisted applications (MVR, TVR, AHP, CHRP, TAHP and others) Cyclic distillation technology – concepts, modeling approach, design and control issues Reactive distillation – fundamentals, equipment, applications, feasibility scheme Results of rigorous simulations in Mathworks Matlab \& Simulink, Aspen Plus, Dynamics and Custom Modeler  Containing abundant examples and industrial case studies, this is a unique resource that tackles the most advanced distillation technologies – all the way from the conceptual design to practical implementation.

Yet that's exactly what we do. Why?In a world where information refreshes endlessly and the workday feels like a race to react to other people's priorities faster, frazzled and distracted has become our default position. But what if the exhaustion of constant busyness wasn't mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel and start taking control of your time and attention? That's what this book is about.As creators of Google Ventures' renowned "design sprint," Jake and John have helped hundreds of teams solve important problems by changing how they work. Building on the success of these sprints and their experience designing ubiquitous tech products from Gmail to YouTube, they spent years experimenting with their own habits and routines, looking for ways to help people optimize their energy, focus, and time. Now they've packaged the most effective tactics into a four-step daily framework that anyone can use to systematically design their days. Make Time is not a one-size-fits-all formula. Instead, it offers a customizable menu of bite-size tips and strategies that can be tailored to individual habits and lifestyles. Make Time isn't about productivity, or checking off more to-dos. Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like throwing out your smartphone or swearing off social media. Making time isn't about radically overhauling your lifestyle; it's about making small shifts in your environment to liberate yourself from constant busyness and distraction.A must-read for anyone who has ever thought, If only there were more hours in the day..., Make Time will help you stop passively reacting to the demands of the modern world and start intentionally making time for the things that matter.},

However, using proven techniques based on experience and mathematical and/or design models can minimize risk and uncertainty when scaling up fluidized beds. Scaling, which maintains that certain dimensionless groups be matched in different sized units for hydrodynamic similarity to be achieved, is different than scale-up, and generally can not be applied to pilot plants used for scale-up. Scaling is typically more useful to be applied to cold model studies that can be used to improve the operation of an existing plant. Deep fluidized beds of Group A materials can cause significant gas bypassing leading to poor gas-solids contacting. Because commercial beds are generally deeper than beds used in pilot plants, care must be taken to ensure that beds that do not exhibit gas bypassing in smaller units, do not have gas bypassing in commercial systems.},

The second section is Aestimation of solid flow pattern in rectangular fluidized bedsB. This section is divided into two parts. In the first part, we apply the simulation model to bubbling rectangular fluidized bed, which is expressed by the rectangular coordinate system in place of the cylindrical coordinate. In the second part, we compute the solid behavior in beds equipped with immersed vertical tubes. Third section is Asolid mixing in bubbling fluidized bedsB.

Fluids are well described by the Navier-Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8-10x finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40-80x fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations, and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black box machine learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework's ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and the Allen–Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.},

  abstract      = {Wet air oxidation is one of the available technologies for the treatment of aqueous wastewaters. In wet air oxidation aqueous waste is oxidized in the liquid phase at high temperatures (400–573K) and pressures (0.5–20MPa) in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas (usually air). The advantages of the process include low operating costs and minimal air pollution discharges, while the main limitations are the high capital costs and safety implications associated with a system operating at such severe operating conditions. As a consequence, significant development in wet air oxidation technology has concentrated on methods of reducing the prohibitive capital costs. In the design of the process a balance must therefore be made between the enhancement of overall reaction rates with temperature and pressure against their effect on capital cost and operational difficulties such as corrosion and scaling of equipment. In this paper the wet air oxidation process is introduced and a number of commercial and emerging technologies presented. These technologies employ a variety of methods to ameliorate the limitations of the technology whilst maintaining acceptable overall reaction rates. These include methods to improve mass transfer as well as the use of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts to enhance reaction rate.},

The reactor is designed to operate with a Ni-based oxygen carrier and is fueled with either natural gas or designed mixtures of CH4, CO, H2, and higher hydrocarbons at 120-kW fuel power. The main design parameters are determined and the DCFB system, which promises large scale applicability, is introduced. The DCFB reactor system features effective control of the solid circulation rate via the primary fast fluidized bed (air reactor) without changing the fluidization regime in the secondary reactor (fuel reactor). Therefore, the secondary reactor can be optimized on fuel conversion without affecting the global solid circulation rates. The air reactor design can focus on the transportation of the solids to the fuel reactor. Besides a short introduction of the auxiliary units of the reactor system, a pressure profile of the pilot rig in hot operation is presented.},

The DSDs determined by the model at different locations in a two-phase flow are evaluated by comparing them to experimental observations obtained in an icing wind tunnel. The satisfactory coincidence between simulation and experimental results proves that the model is reliable when modeling two-phase flows under icing conditions.

  abstract      = {Delivering inherently stable lithium-ion batteries is a key challenge. Electrochemical lithium insertion and extraction often severely alters the electrode crystal chemistry, and this contributes to degradation with electrochemical cycling. Moreover, electrodes do not act in isolation, and this can be difficult to manage, especially in all-solid-state batteries. Therefore, discovering materials that can reversibly insert and extract large quantities of the charge carrier (Li+), that is, high capacity, with inherent stability during electrochemical cycles is necessary. Here lithium-excess vanadium oxides with a disordered rocksalt structure are examined as high-capacity and long-life positive electrode materials. Nanosized Li8/7Ti2/7V4/7O2 in optimized liquid electrolytes deliver a large reversible capacity of over 300\,mAh\,g-1 with two-electron V3+/V5+ cationic redox, reaching 750\,Wh\,kg-1 versus metallic lithium. Critically, highly reversible Li storage and no capacity fading for 400\,cycles were observed in all-solid-state batteries with a sulfide-based solid electrolyte. Operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with high-precision dilatometry reveals excellent reversibility and a near dimensionally invariable character during electrochemical cycling, which is associated with reversible vanadium migration on lithiation and delithiation. This work demonstrates an example of an electrode/electrolyte couple that produces high-capacity and long-life batteries enabled by multi-electron transition metal redox with a structure that is near invariant during cycling.},

A descriptive overview is given of the technology and the market penetration is discussed. To make further analysis possible a database is constructed. This database comprises technological and economical data on 491 FBC projects. Analysis of these projects shows that the technology variants (CFB and BFB) diffused differently over time. Drivers, which influenced the market diffusion and technological development are market regulation, environmental legislation and RD\&D programs. Important drivers for FBC technology are fuel availability, required applications in the market, innovation spill over and competing technologies. In this article technical characteristics are charted, which show improvements in fuel diversification, technical availability, efficiency and emissions. In terms of economical performance the results show a decline in specific investment cost. Finally, the effect of technological learning and experience on the economical performance of FBC technology is analysed using the experience curve method and theory on economies of scale. A problem with applying the experience curve method is that it is not used often for large power plants like FBC plants and with it lacking a methodological standard. A method is therefore suggested. The analyses yielded progress ratios (PR) from 0.42 to 0.93 for different groups of projects (new plant, repower, retrofit, add-on and conversion) and different parts of the capital breakdown (total project price, engineering, procurement and construction price and boiler price). This means that the specific investment prices (in \$/kWe) decline with, respectively, 58\% and 7\% with every doubling of cumulative installed capacity (in MWe). The progress ratio found for new FBC plants lies between 0.90 and 0.93. These values correspond with the average PR of 0.90 found for power plants in the literature. Further results show that economies of scale have a significant influence on the investment price. Scale factors are found in the range of 0.62–0.81 for different groups of projects. According to these scale factors specific investment price decreases, respectively, between 25\% and 12\% with every doubling of plant capacity (in MWe).},

Thermal pyrolysis is conducted at higher temperatures, but catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) is a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. CDM is generally carried out over four types of catalyst: nickel, carbon, noble metal and iron. The applied reactors can be fixed bed, fluidized bed, plasma bed or molten-metal reactors. Two main advantages of CDM are that (i) carbon-oxide free hydrogen, ideal for fuel cell applications, is formed and (ii) the by-product can be tailored into carbon with advanced morphology (e.g., nanofibers, nanotubes). The aim of this review is to reveal the very recent research advances of the last two years achieved in the field of this promising prospective technology.},

High-intensity ultrasound is an effective technology to generate different bio-based structures in sub-micron or nanometer scale. This technique owing to some intrinsic advantages such as safety, straightforward operation, energy efficiency, and scale-up potential, as well as, ability to control over size and morpHology has stood out among various nanosynthetic routes. Ultrasonically-provided energy is mainly transferred to the droplets and particles via acoustic cavitation (which is formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in solvent). This review provides an outlook on the fundamentals of ultrasonication and some applicable setups in nanoencapsulation. Different kinds of nanostructures based on surfactants, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates formed by sonication, along with their advantages and disadvantages are assessed from the viewpoint of stability, particle size, and process impacts on some functionalities. The gastrointestinal fate and safety issues of ultrasonically prepared nanostructures are also discussed. Sonication, itself or in combination with other encapsulation approaches, alongside biopolymers generate nano-engineered carriers with enough stability, small particle sizes, and a low polydispersity. The nano-sized systems improve techno-functional activities of encapsulated bioactive agents including stability, solubility, dissolution, availability, controlled and targeted release profile in vitro and in vivo plus other bioactive properties such as antioxidant and antimicrobial capacities. Ultrasonically prepared nanocarriers show a great potential in fortifying food products with desired bioactive components, especially for the industrial applications.},

Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.},

  abstract      = {Background: Ultrasonic cleaners are used for fine cleaning of medical devices, removing soil from joints, crevices, lumens, and other areas that are difficult to clean using other methods. To accomplish this fine cleaning, ultrasonic cleaners use a process known as cavitation. To understand the function of the cavitation process on items that require enhanced cleaning, a study was conducted to determine whether four commercially available products claiming to test for cavitation actually detect cavitation activity.Methods: Each of the products selected for the study were placed into a Mason jar containing cleaning solution at temperatures of 77\textdegree{}F (25\textdegree{}C) and 100\textdegree{}F (38\textdegree{}C), with no cavitation energy generated. The jars were agitated by vigorous manual shaking for five seconds (one time per minute for 15 minutes) by the same operator. The results of the commercial testing products were interpreted according to manufacturers' instructions for use and recorded following the 15-minute agitation process. Each test was repeated three times.Results: Three of the four commercially available tests claiming to detect cavitation were demonstrated to not be specific to cavitation. Each of the three tests satisfied the criteria for passing when in the absence of cavitation.Conclusion: Cavitation is an important and necessary function of all ultrasonic cleaners. The results of the study clearly demonstrate that even when no cavitation is being produced, certain tests will still provide results indicating the presence of cavitation. Those tests do not distinguish between cavitation energy and the other parameters in an ultrasonic cleaner.},

  abstract      = {In the present work a thermal Lattice-Boltzmann method (TLBM) is applied to study convection-diffusion problems and to determine averaged Nusselt numbers for particles being part of differently dense random packings. For the carried out numerical investigations a 3D TLBM framework is derived. Therein the hydrodynamic side is solved with a D3Q19 multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator and interpolated bounce back schemes. For the thermal side two different collision operators namely Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) and MRT are applied and compared against each other. Furthermore, the impact of the LBM mesh structure is examined by comparing a D3Q7 and a D3Q19 model for the thermal side. Thermal diffusion and convection-diffusion problems for plane and curved boundaries are then studied and the results are validated against analytical solutions, when available or compared to established closure correlations. Furthermore, the best collision operator and boundary conditions - regarding numerical accuracy and stability - are selected to investigate convective-diffusive interphase heat transfer inside different static, random particle/fluid systems for varying porosities, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Obtained results are compared against published correlations. In addition a new closure correlation for drag forces and particle averaged Nusselt numbers in random particle packings in the range of \ensuremath{\epsilon} = 0.6 - 1, Rep = 20 - 500 and Pr = 0.5 - 1.5 is proposed.},

  abstract      = {Discrete element methods are extremely helpful in understanding the complex behaviors of granular media, as they give valuable insight into all internal variables of the system. In this paper, a novel discrete element method for performing simulations of granular media is presented, based on the minimization of the potential energy in the system. Contrary to most discrete element methods (i.e., soft-particle method, event-driven method, and non-smooth contact dynamics), the system does not evolve by (approximately) integrating Newtons equations of motion in time, but rather by searching for mechanical equilibrium solutions for the positions of all particles in the system, which is mathematically equivalent to locally minimizing the potential energy. The new method allows for the rapid creation of jammed initial conditions (to be used for further studies) and for the simulation of quasi-static deformation problems. The major advantage of the new method is that it allows for truly static deformations. The system does not evolve with time, but rather with the externally applied strain or load, so that there is no kinetic energy in the system, in contrast to other quasi-static methods. The performance of the algorithm for both types of applications of the method is tested. Therefore we look at the required number of iterations, for the system to converge to a stable solution. For each single iteration, the required computational effort scales linearly with the number of particles. During the process of creating initial conditions, the required number of iterations for two-dimensional systems scales with the square root of the number of particles in the system. The required number of iterations increases for systems closer to the jamming packing fraction. For a quasi-static pure shear deformation simulation, the results of the new method are validated by regular soft-particle dynamics simulations. The energy minimization algorithm is able to capture the evolution of the isotropic and deviatoric stress and fabric of the system. Both methods converge in the limit of quasi-static deformations, but show interestingly different results otherwise. For a shear amplitude of \\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$\$, as little as 100 sampling points seems to be a good compromise between accuracy and computational time needed.},

  abstract      = {"In the recent decades, the emerging new molecular measurement techniques and their subsequent availability in chemical database has allowed easier retrieval of the associated data by the chemical analyst. Before the data revolution, most books focused either on mathematical modeling of chemical processes or exploratory chemometrics. Computational and Statistical Methods for Chemical Engineering aims to combine these two approaches and provide aspiring chemical engineers a single, comprehensive account of computational and statistical methods. The book consists of four parts: Part I discusses the necessary calculus, linear algebra, and probability background that the student may or may not have encountered before. Part II provides an overview on standard computational methods and approximation techniques useful for chemical engineering systems. Part III covers the most important statistical models, starting from simple measurement models, via linear models all the way to multivariate, non-linear stochiometric models. Part IV focuses on the importance of designed experiments and robust analyses. Each chapter is accompanied by an extensive selection of theoretical and practical exercises. The book can be used in combination with any modern computational environment, such as R, Python and MATLAB. Given its easy and free availability, the book includes a bonus chapter giving a simple introduction to R programming. This book is particularly suited for undergraduate students in Chemical Engineering who require a semester course in computational and statistical methods. The background chapters on calculus, linear algebra and probability make the book entirely self-contained. The book takes its examples from the field of chemistry and chemical engineering. In this way, it motivates the student to engage actively with the material and to master the techniques that have become crucial for the modern chemical engineer"--},

  abstract      = {The separation of CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 mixtures is of practical importance for CO2 capture and other applications in the processing industries. Use of membranes with microporous layers of zeolites, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) offer considerable promise for use in such separations. In view of the extremely wide variety of available microporous structures, there is a need for a systematic screening of potential candidates in order to obtain the best permeation selectivities, Sperm. The permeation selectivity is a product of the adsorption selectivity, Sads, and the diffusion selectivity, Sdiff, i.e. Sperm=Sads\texttimes{}Sdiff. For maximizing Sperm, we need to choose materials for which Sads and Sdiff complement each other. For a wide variety of zeolites, we have used Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations of mixture adsorption isotherms, along with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of diffusivities for three binary mixtures, CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2, to calculate Sads, Sdiff, and Sperm. These simulation results provide insights into the influence of pore size, pore topology and pore connectivity that influences each of the three selectivities. In particular, we emphasize the important role of correlations in the diffusion behaviors within microporous materials. Furthermore, we have constructed Robeson plots for each of the separations in order to provide generic guidelines to the choice of materials that offer the appropriate compromise between Sperm and the membrane permeability.},

  abstract      = {The efficacy of nanoporous crystalline materials in separation applications is often influenced to a significant extent by diffusion of guest molecules within the pores of the structural frameworks. The Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) equations provide a fundamental and convenient description of mixture diffusion. The M–S formulation highlights two separate factors that cause mixture diffusion to be intrinsically coupled: correlation effects, and thermodynamic coupling. By careful and detailed analyses of a variety of published experimental data on (a) mixture permeation across nanoporous membranes, (b) transient uptake of mixtures within crystals, and (c) transient breakthrough characteristics of fixed bed adsorbers, we identify conditions that require the use of M–S equations including both correlation effects and thermodynamic coupling. Situations are also identified in which either of the coupling effects can be ignored. Correlation effects cause slowing-down of more-mobile-less-strongly-adsorbed molecules by tardier-more-strongly-adsorbed-partner species; such slowing-down effects are often essential for modeling mixture permeation across nanoporous membranes. Overshoots in the transient uptake of the more mobile partners in single crystals are essentially the consequence of thermodynamic coupling, originating from sizable off-diagonal elements of thermodynamic correction factors \ensuremath{\Gamma}ij. In the case of transient breakthrough of hexane isomers in a fixed bed of MFI zeolite, we show that thermodynamic coupling effects lead to a significant improvement in the separation performance.},

Towards this end, we performed Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations of mixture adsorption equilibrium, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of guest diffusivities in unary (CO2, CH4, N2, and H2), binary (CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, CH4/N2, CO2/H2), and ternary (CO2/CH4/N2, CO2/CH4/H2, CO2/N2/H2) mixtures in four zeolites: CHA, DDR, MFI, and FAU. The combined CBMC and MD data are used to obtain fundamental insights into the adsorption, diffusion, and permeation characteristics of the variety of guest/host combinations. Application of the Myers-Prausnitz theory shows that the adsorption selectivity for the i-j pair, Sads,ij, in ternary mixtures has practically the same value as for the binary i-j mixture, provided the comparison is made as the same surface potential \ensuremath{\Phi}, a convenient and practical proxy for the spreading pressure \ensuremath{\pi}, that is calculable on the basis of the data on the unary isotherms of the constituent guests. For the mixtures investigated, departures from thermodynamic idealities do not cause deviations from the uniqueness of the Sads,ij~vs~\ensuremath{\Phi} dependence because the ratios of the activity coefficients \ensuremath{\gamma}i/\ensuremath{\gamma}j also appear to uniquely depend on \ensuremath{\Phi}. The surface potential \ensuremath{\Phi} is also the thermodynamically correct metric to describe the loading dependence of diffusivities. Compared at the same \ensuremath{\Phi}, the diffusion selectivity for the i-j pair, Sdiff,ij, in ternary mixtures has practically the same value as for the binary i-j mixture. Consequently, the permeation selectivity, Sperm,ij=Sads,ij\texttimes{}Sdiff,ij is also uniquely dependent on \ensuremath{\Phi}. When compared at the same \ensuremath{\Phi}, the component permeabilities, \ensuremath{\Pi}i for CO2, CH4, and N2 are found to be independent of the partners in the binary and ternary mixtures investigated and have practically the same as the values for the corresponding unary permeabilities.},

  abstract      = {This article has the objective of elucidating the variety of factors that quantify influences of intracrystalline diffusion on mixture separations in fixed bed devices packed with microporous crystalline adsorbents such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolites. Such diffusional influences may act either synergistically or anti-synergistically to the mixture adsorption equilibrium, providing the ratio of the diffusivities \DJ{}1/\DJ{}2 \gg{}1. Experimental data on transient mixture uptake inside single crystals display overshoots in the loadings of the more mobile guest species; this overshoot can be quantitatively captured by use of the Maxwell–Stefan (M-S) diffusion formulation that takes proper account of thermodynamic coupling influences; if such thermodynamic influences are ignored, as is done in the Linear Driving Force (LDF) model, overshoots are not realizable. The use of the M-S formulation to simulate transient breakthroughs in fixed bed adsorbers provides a quantitative match with experiments; the match is significantly poorer if thermodynamic coupling effects are ignored. For a fixed bed of length L, packed with adsorbent particles of radius rc and operating with an interstitial gas velocity, v, the diffusional influences are quantified by two separate parameters: (a) diffusional time constant, \DJ{}1/rc2, and gas–particle contact time L/v. The transient breakthroughs are uniquely dependent on the product (\DJ{}1/rc2)(L/v); this result is of practical importance for scaling up from small scale laboratory units to large scale industrial units that use different particle sizes, bed dimensions, and gas velocities.},

  abstract      = {With increasing computer power simulation methods addressing discrete problems in a broad range of scientific fields become more and more available. The discrete element method is one of these discontinuous approaches used for modeling granular assemblies. Within this method the dynamics of a system of particles is modeled by tracking the motion of individual particles and their interaction with their adjacencies over time. For the interaction of particles, force models need to be specified. The resulting equations of motion are of coupled ordinary differential configuration, which are usually solved by explicit numerical schemes. In large-scale systems like avalanches, planetary rings, hoppers or chemical reactors vast numbers of particles need to be addressed. Therefore, integration schemes need to be accurate on the one hand, but also numerically efficient on the other hand. This numerical efficiency is characterized by the method's demand for memory and CPU-time. In this paper a number of mostly explicit numerical integration schemes are reviewed and applied to the benchmark problem of a particle impacting a fixed wall as investigated experimentally by Gorham and Kharaz [Gorham, D. A., \& Kharaz, A. H. (2000). The measurement of particle rebound characteristics. Powder Technology, 112(3), 193–202]. The accurate modeling which includes the correct integration of the equations of motion is essential. In discrete simulation methods the accuracy of properties on the single particle level directly influence the global properties of the granular assembly like velocity distributions, porosities or flow rates, whereas their correct knowledge is often of key interest in engineering applications. The impact experiment is modeled with simple force displacement approaches which allow an analytical solution of the problem. Aspects discussed are the dependency of the step size on the accuracy of certain collision properties and the related computing time. The effect of a fixed time step is analyzed. Guidelines for the efficient selection of an integration scheme considering the additional computational cost by contact detection and force calculation are presented.},

The same analysis is then performed for two-phase horizontal flows, where gravitational settling starts to exert a stronger influence over the distribution of particles within the flow domain. All computations carried out take into account the effect of Saffman force and particle-wall collisions. Although both flows considered could be reasonably regarded as two dimensional, knowledge gained from such a study is expected to be also applicable to three-dimensional gassolid flow problems.},

The correlation factor `m' of the Godard–Richardson equation has been expressed as a function of promoter parameters for promoted beds in addition to bed parameters as in the case of unpromoted beds. Three correlations for `m' have been proposed for unpromoted and promoted beds with rod and blade promoters. The comparison of the results reveals that the Godard–Richardson equation is more suitable for unpromoted beds in the original form. In the case of promoted beds, the prediction deviates from the corresponding experimental values due to poor representation of flow parameter. Hence, the flow parameter of the Godard–Richardson equation has also been modified for beds with rod and blade promoters. A comparison has been made between the predicted values of bed expansion using the modified Godard–Richardson equation and the predicted vlaues obtained by correlations developed by Kumar and Roy (2002a) and the corresponding experimental values.},

Three different sets of Kenics mixer (aspect ratio = 1.5) comprised of 3, 9 and 25 elements each have been characterized. The Reynolds number was varied in the range of 1 to 25,000 (i.e., from laminar to turbulent flow regime). The numerical approach takes into account the aspects of the fluid flow at higher Reynolds number values including circumferential velocity profiles at different cross-sections within the Kenics mixer, which were neglected in previous studies. It was observed that cross-sectional mixing in the turbulent flow regime takes place up to 30\% of each element length at element-to-element transition; beyond that velocity profiles were uniform. The experiments were also carried out to measure the circumferential and axial velocity profiles and pressure drop in three different Kenics Mixers using air as fluid. The pressure drop per unit element ( P/\ensuremath{\eta}) was found to be independent of the number of Kenics mixing elements used in the system. The total pressure drop across Kenics mixer obtained by CFD simulations were compared with the experimental pressure drop values and correlations available in the literature. The numerical results were found in good agreement with the experimental as well as the results reported in the literature. A new pressure drop correlation in the Kenics static mixer has been developed.},

  abstract      = {Nanoemulsions are kinetically stable biphasic dispersion of two immiscible liquids typically stabilized by an emulsifier with droplet sizes in the range of 10–200 nm. Present work deals with the formulation and characterization of stable oil-in-water nanoemulsions using nonionic surfactant (Tween 40) and light mineral oil for their application in enhanced oil recovery. The stability study of the nanoemulsions formed by high energy and low energy method was accomplished by bottle testing method. The emulsions were characterized in terms of droplet size, morphology and inner structure, surface charge, interfacial tension, and rheology. Droplet sizes of 18–31 nm obtained by dynamic light scattering analysis and surface charge values above -35 mV obtained by \ensuremath{\zeta} potential measurement prove the higher kinetic stability of the formed emulsions. Cryo-TEM micrographs reveal the surface morphology and inner structure of nanoemulsions. A miscibility test was performed to determine the dissolving ability of the nanoemulsions with crude oil. Measurement of interfacial tension (IFT) by pendant drop method shows a considerable reduction in IFT values with the increase of surfactant concentration and temperature, which is highly desirable for recovering trapped oil from the fine pores of the reservoirs. The viscosity of the nanoemulsions remains stable at a wide temperature (30–70 \textdegree{}C) range, denoting its thermal stability. The viscoelastic property of prepared nanoemulsions shows the increase of storage modulus (G\ensuremath{'}) and loss modulus (G\ensuremath{''}) with the increase in surfactant concentration and angular frequency (rad/s). Specific frequency (SF), the crossover point of G\ensuremath{'} and G\ensuremath{''}, indicates the transition between elastic and viscous phases of nanoemulsions. A stable value of loss modulus after SF denotes better flowability of the emulsion. To test the efficiency of nanoemulsion in enhanced oil recovery, flooding experiment was performed by injection of a small pore volume of emulsion slug in a sand pack system, and an additional recovery of 28.94\% was obtained after conventional water flooding.}

The objective is to integrate data and physics seamlessly without the need of employing elaborate and computationally taxing data assimilation schemes. However, preprocessing, problem formulation, code generation, postprocessing and analysis are still time consuming and may prevent SciML from wide applicability in industrial applications and in digital twin frameworks. Here, we integrate the various stages of SciML under the umbrella of ChatGPT, to formulate CrunchGPT, which plays the role of a conductor orchestrating the entire workflow of SciML based on simple prompts by the user. Specifically, we present two examples that demonstrate the potential use of CrunchGPT in optimizing airfoils in aerodynamics, and in obtaining flow fields in various geometries in interactive mode, with emphasis on the validation stage. To demonstrate the flow of the CrunchGPT, and create an infrastructure that can facilitate a broader vision, we built a webapp based guided user interface, that includes options for a comprehensive summary report. The overall objective is to extend CrunchGPT to handle diverse problems in computational mechanics, design, optimization and controls, and general scientific computing tasks involved in SciML, hence using it as a research assistant tool but also as an educational tool. While here the examples focus in fluid mechanics, future versions will target solid mechanics and materials science, geophysics, systems biology and bioinformatics.},

A comparative evaluation using various extraction methods viz., alkaline extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, and ultrasound-assisted alkaline extraction method (ODF) was employed vis-\`{a}-vis its effect on yield, kinetics, thermal stability, morphological, and functional properties of IDF. Ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction method was optimized to extract IDF and was found to be the best extraction method and standardized using rotatable central composite design with time of 30 min, amplitude of 30\%, solid to liquid ratio (1:20), and NaOH concentration 1.2 mol/L. ODF evinced biologically rich and higher water and oil holding capacities with low peak and final transition temperature. The morphology of IDF also varied distinctly with extraction processes. ODF conclusively evidenced that it has immense potential to scale up in fulfilling the commercial demand of IDF. Novelty impact statement The pea peel insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) has enormous potential in food processing industries in developing functional foods which could unleash health benefit properties. The utilization could also minimize the environmental footprint of food wastage and disposal issues. The developed IDF from green pea peel (GPP) has enormous economic feasibility among various commercial food sectors viz., beverage, dairy, meat, and other health-promoting food industries. Extraction of IDF by a suitable extraction method from GPP by-product which was discarded largely hitherto has immense potential of generating substantial economic benefits every year and it can be an innovative approach for generating functional food ingredients.},

Our experimental results reveal that the droplet breakup regimes, namely, obstruction, tunnel, combined, non-breakup, and parallel, are the functions of xanthan gum concentration and the continuous phase flow rate. We examined the influence of fluid properties on droplet breakup stages by varying the xanthan gum concentration in an aqueous solution that exhibited increasing shear-thinning and elastic properties with its concentration. Four sequential stages (squeezing, transition, pinch-off, and filament thinning) are identified during the droplet breakup process. We found that upstream pressure controlled the squeezing stage, and fluid properties mainly steered the filament rupture stage. A complex interaction between elastic, capillary, and inertial forces further divided the final stage into the stretching and fluid-drainage stages. The Hencky strain characterized the formation of a persistent cylindrical filament in the stretching stage that decayed exponentially in the fluid-drainage stage. Eventually, this study highlights the significance of parallel branches with asymmetric geometric confinements on droplet splitting. Enhanced asymmetry is observed for the elongated filament, emphasizing the dominance of feedback from the downstream confinement.},

  abstract      = {Rotary desiccant air conditioning system, which combines the technologies of desiccant dehumidification and evaporative cooling, is advantageous in being free from CFCs, using low grade thermal energy and controlling humidity and temperature separately. Compared with conventional vapor compression air conditioning system, it preserves the merits of environment-friendly, energy saving, healthy, comfortable, etc. Ongoing research and development works suggest that new desiccant materials and novel system configurations have significant potential for improving the performance and reliability and reducing the cost and size of rotary desiccant dehumidification and air conditioning system, thereby increasing its market competitiveness and breaking out the current fairly small niche market. For the purpose of providing an overview of recent efforts on these issues and showing how rotary desiccant air conditioning systems can be designed and coupled to available thermal energy, this paper presents and analyzes the status of rotary desiccant dehumidification and air conditioning in the following three aspects: the development of advanced desiccant materials, the optimization of system configuration and the utilization of solar energy and other low grade heat sources, such as solar energy, district heating, waste heat and bioenergy. Some key problems to further push forward the research and development of this technology are also summarized.},

Under the experimental conditions, both reactants influence both reaction rates; however, product influence is negligible because of their small partial pressures present in the reactor. High oxygen/ethylene ratios and lower temperature favored selectivity to the epoxidation reaction. The kinetic parameters obtained from the differential reactor experiments were refined to match the fixed-bed reactor experiments. With this, the average error in predicting both ethylene conversion and selectivity to ethylene oxide was 4.3\%.

Multicomponent alloys are subject to complex interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters and display a rich variety of microstructural features which are not seen in binary alloys. Achieving microstructural control of multicomponent alloys is central to their efficacy in specific applications. Unraveling the chemistry-thermomechanical processing-microstructure relationships in multicomponent alloys only through experiments have been proven to be a resource intensive approach. Quantitative simulations of microstructural evolution in multicomponent alloys using the technique of phase-field modeling can significantly offset the experimental burden and provide an energy efficient and sustainable framework for alloy design. In this review, we focus on those phase-field models which can consider the evolution of multiple phases simultaneously in a multicomponent system and attempt to understand the history of their emergence as tools of predictive value. We briefly review the studies conducted with such multiphase, multicomponent phase-field models and conclude with a commentary on the future role of phase-field modeling towards the sustainable development of novel multicomponent alloys.},

However, the high carbon dioxide (CO2) content in biogas limits its value as a fuel. `Biogas upgrading' is an advanced process which removes CO2 from biogas, thereby converting biogas to biomethane, which has a higher commercial value. Microbial technologies offer a sustainable and cost-effective way to upgrade biogas, removing CO2 using hydrogen (H2) as electron donor, generated by surplus electricity from renewable wind or solar energy. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be applied to convert CO2 with H2 to methane (CH4), or alternatively, homoacetogens can convert both CO2 and H2 into value-added chemicals. Here, we comprehensively review the current state of biogas generation and utilization, and describe the advances in biological, H2-dependent biogas upgrading technologies, with particular attention to key challenges associated with the processes, e.g., metabolic limitations, low H2 transfer rate, and finite CO2 conversion rate. We also highlight several new strategies for overcoming technical barriers to achieve efficient CO2 conversion, including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation, novel reactor designs to improve H2 transfer rate and utilization efficiency, and employing advanced genetic engineering tools to generate more efficient microorganisms. The insights offered in this review will promote further exploration into microbial, H2-driven biogas upgrading, towards addressing the global energy crisis and climate change associated with use of fossil fuels.},

In this study, the coupled level set with volume of fluid (CLSVOF) method is employed to investigate bubble dynamics and macroscopic hydrodynamics in a gas–liquid stirred tank after model validation. The results demonstrate that: i) based on the dynamics of bubble clusters within the system, the stirred tank can be categorized into four distinct regions: the dispersal region, accumulation region, rising wall-region, and reflex region; ii) in the dispersal region, the rear of impeller blade generates large-scale vortex. Two merging modes are identified during the bubble rupture process: the merging of bubbles at adjacent orifices and the merging of discrete bubbles with the back of impeller blade due to negative pressure. Two bubble breakup modes are observed: bubble breakup at the back of the impeller blade due to stretching and the breakup of bubbles growing at orifices due to disturbance caused by the impeller blade; iii) the inertial forces predominantly control most bubbles in the system. A predictive correlation for bubble velocity is proposed; iv) elevating the stirring speed increases bubble number in the accumulation region. Moreover, enlarging gas flow rate and fluid viscosity leads to a discernible augmentation of overall bubble size; v) at the macroscopic scale, the radial, axial, and tangential velocities of the system exhibit an increase with enlarging stirring speed, while showing no significant change with the increase in gas flow rate. Additionally, as fluid viscosity and density increase, the flow undergoes a transition from turbulent flow to laminar flow.},

For this purpose two different gas–solid flow configurations laden with small and large particles are considered, namely an axisymmetric particle-laden jet flow and an upward pipe flow. As a result, the consistent terms are able to reproduce both situations, suppression and enhancement of fluid turbulence for small and large particles, whereas the standard terms can only deal with situations implying turbulence attenuation.},

Experiments and calculations are carried out for different spherical glass beads with diameters between 60 and 625 \ensuremath{\mu}m and mass loadings up to 1.0 (kg particles/kg gas). Additionally, stainless steel walls with different wall roughness are considered. In all experiments the air volume flow rate is constant in order to maintain a fixed gas average velocity of 20 m/s. As a result, the pressure drop in the channel is strongly influenced by wall roughness. Higher wall roughness implies higher pressure drop because of the increase in wall collision frequency, whereby momentum is extracted from the fluid due to two-way coupling. The numerical computations were performed by the Euler/Lagrange approach accounting for two-way and four-way coupling. For the calculation of the particle motion all relevant forces (i.e. drag, transverse lift and gravity), inter-particle collisions and wall collisions with wall roughness were considered. The agreement of the computations with the experiments was found to be very good for the gas and particle velocities as well as the pressure drop. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Validated predictions of fluidization behavior would benefit such industrially relevant applications. Accurate representation of the fluid-particle momentum exchange, i.e., the drag and buoyancy forces, is one key to developing reliable mathematical tools for studying fluid-particle hydrodynamics. A significant number of drag correlations exist, yet little (widely accepted) guidance is available on which formulation is the most appropriate. The contributions focusing on predicting the drag from flows through random assemblies of monodisperse spheres alone comprises a substantial subset of the available literature. An assumption of homogeneous distribution of solids is at the core of an overwhelming majority of these drag correlations, i.e., homogeneous drag correlations. Hence, we review correlations for predicting the drag force for flows past homogeneous suspensions of spherical particles with narrow size distributions, which are the foundation for (i) predicating the drag force of flow past non-ideal particle assemblies (non-spherical, polydisperse, etc.), and (ii) developing sub-grid drag closures. Here, many of the commonly used homogeneous drag models are overviewed in detail, including the datasets and methods for development and validation. Potential sources of error between model prediction are identified and the accumulation of uncertainty in model development is presented. We demonstrate a lack of drag model development and/or validation over the complete parameter space (solids volume fractions, Reynolds numbers, density ratios, etc.) relevant to industrial fluid-particle flows, and discuss the underpinning physical and computational limitations driving this gap.},

  abstract      = {The condensation of heavy hydrocarbon causes the coke formation inside the disengager vessel. Slurry oil is the heaviest component of FCC hydrocarbon products and most likely to be condensed to form coke. Converting slurry to lighter hydrocarbons can alleviate coke formation. The slurry cracking experiments were carried out in a confined fluidized bed reactor. The results showed that the crackability of slurry was lower than that of FCC feedstock, due to the difference of their properties. About 30 wt.\% heavy oil remained in the product after the slurry was cracked, but its end point declined and the heavier component decreased. The comparison of slurry cracking results at different reaction temperatures and regenerated catalyst contents indicated that the appropriate operating conditions for slurry conversion were the reaction temperature of 500 8C and the regenerated catalyst content within 25–50 wt.\%.},

  abstract      = {This work initially focuses on developing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of an industrial-scale steam methane reforming reactor (reforming tube) used to produce hydrogen. Subsequently, we design and evaluate three different feedback control schemes to drive the area-weighted average hydrogen mole fraction measured at the reforming tube outlet (x\textasciimacron{}H2outlet) to a desired set-point value (x\textasciimacron{}H2set) under the influence of a tube-side feed disturbance. Specifically, a CFD model of an industrial-scale reforming tube is developed in ANSYS Fluent with realistic geometry characteristics to simulate the transport and chemical reaction phenomena with approximate representation of the catalyst packing. Then, to realize the real-time regulation of the hydrogen production, the manipulated input and controlled output are chosen to be the outer reforming tube wall temperature profile and x\textasciimacron{}H2outlet respectively. On the problem of feedback control, a proportional (P) control scheme, a proportional-integral (PI) control scheme and a control scheme combining dynamic optimization and integral feedback control to generate the outer reforming tube wall temperature profile based on x\textasciimacron{}H2set are designed and integrated into real-time CFD simulation of the reforming tube to track x\textasciimacron{}H2set. The CFD simulation results demonstrated that feedback control schemes can drive the value of x\textasciimacron{}H2outlet toward x\textasciimacron{}H2set in the presence of a tube-side feed disturbance and can significantly improve the process dynamics compared to the dynamics under open-loop control.},

Three different Ilow regimes (dunes !, dunes !I and slug Ilow) :ire investigated. In long pipes the carrier gas experiences notable axial expansion which results in an evolution o1'the flow along the pipe so that the pressure prolile is no longer linear. The axial variation of the gas volumetric llow rale is used to determine Ihe separate effects of the gas volmnetric flow rate and the solids flow rate on tke pressure gradient. A general pressure drop law is obtained which proves to be independent of both flow regime and pipe dialneter.

The order of magnitude of the rate constant is determined at different catalyst concentrations, allowing the use of hydrazine oxidation by air as a chemical reaction which is slow in the mass transfer film but fast in the bulk of the liquid.

Discrete element methods (DEM) present an opportunity to study such interactions. In gas-particle flows with higher solids loadings, particle-particle interactions give rise to particle clustering and/or microstructure formation. In this paper we show how DEM can be used to determine not only the particle-phase stress (required for gas-particle two-fluid CFD models) in the case of particle clustering, but also how DEM can be used to determine the nature, size and composition of the observed microstructure.},

  abstract      = {Enzymes that proceed through multistep reaction mechanisms often utilize complex, polar active sites positioned with sub-angstrom precision to mediate distinct chemical steps, which makes their de novo construction extremely challenging. We sought to overcome this challenge using the classic catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of serine hydrolases as a model system. We used RFdiffusion1 to generate proteins housing catalytic sites of increasing complexity and varying geometry, and a newly developed ensemble generation method called ChemNet to assess active site geometry and preorganization at each step of the reaction. Experimental characterization revealed novel serine hydrolases that catalyze ester hydrolysis with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) up to 3.8 \texttimes{} 103 M-1 s-1, closely match the design models (C\ensuremath{\alpha} RMSDs {$<$} 1 \AA{}), and have folds distinct from natural serine hydrolases. In silico selection of designs based on active site preorganization across the reaction coordinate considerably increased success rates, enabling identification of new catalysts in screens of as few as 20 designs. Our de novo buildup approach provides insight into the geometric determinants of catalysis that complements what can be obtained from structural and mutational studies of native enzymes (in which catalytic group geometry and active site makeup cannot be so systematically varied), and provides a roadmap for the design of industrially relevant serine hydrolases and, more generally, for designing complex enzymes that catalyze multi-step transformations.},

In these industrial processes, it is of crucial importance to optimize the contact between the injected liquid and the bed solids to minimize agglomeration, to ensure good reactor operability, and to allow reactions to proceed under minimum heat and mass transfer limitations in order to maximize the yields of valuable products. It has been shown [P. House, M. Saberian, C. Briens, F. Berruti, E. Chan, Injection of a liquid spray into a fluidized bed: particle–liquid mixing and impact on fluid coker yields. Industrial \& Engineering Chemistry Research 43 (2004) 5663–5669., S. Bruhns, J. Werther, An investigation of the mechanism of liquid injection into fluidized beds. AIChE Journal 51 (2005) 766–775] that the nozzle technology and the operating conditions have a significant effect on the quality of the liquid–solid interaction resulting from the injection of gas-atomized liquid feed. The goal of this study was to develop a rapid and reliable experimental technique to assess the liquid–solid contact efficiency resulting from the injection of a liquid feed into a fluidized bed. Air-fluidized silica sand particles were first charged by triboelectrification as a result of their random collisions with the inner walls of the fluidized bed. Immediately after the injection of water through an aerated nozzle, the fluidization air was stopped and the wetted bed solids were allowed to settle. While the bed was defluidized, the triboelectric charges accumulated on the particles migrated to a grounded electrode through the low-resistance paths offered by the conductive liquid. A stronger electric current flowing through the electrode indicated that the liquid was more evenly distributed on the solid particles. The intensity of the current flowing through the electrode was, therefore, used to define a spray nozzle performance index. This technique was used to examine the effect of increasing the nozzle aeration, and, specifically, the gas-to-liquid mass ratio (G/L) through the nozzle on the liquid–solid contact efficiency. The results showed that changing the nozzle geometry can change how the contact efficiency between atomized liquid and fluidized solids varies with (G/L), especially at relatively high G/L ratios. A model of the time-evolution of the electric current generated during defluidization of the bed solids is also presented.},

For the higher inlet pressures used, the value of the biodegradability index (BI) increased by 23\% and 13\% for 5.0 and 7.0 bar, respectively, after 60 min of the process. The value of COD as well as the VS, TS, TC and TOC concentrations dropped for each analyzed inlet pressure, which indicated that complex organic compounds were effectively destroyed. The highest disintegration degree (DDCOD) was achieved with an inlet pressure of 3.5 bar. SEM analysis was performed to analyze the changing morphological structure of the HW. It was proven that the structural morphology of the herbal waste was significantly influenced by hydrodynamic cavitation, which could affect subsequent biological processing.},

  abstract      = {The drag law proposed by Gidaspow (1994, Multiphase Flow and Fluidization, Academic Press, p. 35–37), which is a combination of the Ergun (1954, Chem. Eng. Progress, 48, p. 89–94) and the Wen and Yu (1966, Chem. Eng. Progr. Symp. Ser., 62, p. 100–110) empirical correlations, has been widely used in the literature. Physically, the drag is known to be a continuous function of both the solid volume fraction and the Reynolds number, though the transition between the two correlations proposed by Gidaspow (1994) is discontinuous in solid volume fraction. In the present work, the effect of (i) the volume fraction chosen for transition and (ii) the form of the function used when ``stitching'' the Ergun (1954) and Wen and Yu (1966) correlations on the bubbling behavior of gas-fluidized beds is studied. A Multi-Phase Particle-in-Cell (MP-PIC) model is used for these purposes. In addition to the discontinuous stitching method, other methods based on arctan and linear functions are also considered. Two test monodisperse systems are examined: (i) an injected bubble in a gas-fluidized bed held close to its minimum fluidization velocity, and (ii) a freely-bubbling, gas-fluidized bed at several times the minimum fluidization velocity. In the injected-bubble system, the dynamic pressure drop profile, bubble growth rate, bubble structure at end of the injection period, detachment time, and average solid volume fraction within the bubble are examined. In the freely-bubbling bed, the time-averaged histogram of equivalent diameter, bubble equivalent diameter as a function of height, time-averaged mean pierced length, the time-averaged bubble flux (i.e., visible bubble flow), and radial mean of the time-averaged bubble flux were investigated. Overall, the bubble properties are affected by the location of the transition point, whereas the chosen form of the continuous stitching function has little impact.},

  abstract      = {Feedstock injection is an essential step of the fluid catalytic cracking process in which complex phenomena take place, such as droplet formation and dispersion, liquid heat-up and vaporization. These phenomena greatly affect product and coke yields. Several models have been proposed to estimate the vaporization of feed droplets in the riser injection zone. However, depending on the assumptions on which the model is based, completely different vaporization times may be predicted. No experimental validation exists to discriminate between the various models. This paper presents the first method for the accurate measurement of the vaporization kinetics of a liquid spray injected into a hot fluidized bed. The droplet size has a very strong effect on the vaporization. With a droplet size of 60 mm, it takes about 100 ms to vaporize 50\% of the liquid; with a droplet size of 30 mm, this time is cut by half. \# 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {The phase-field equations have many attractive characteristics. First, phase separation can be induced by the phase-field equations. It transforms from a single homogeneous mixture to two distinct phases in a nascent state. Second, the solution of the phase-field equations is bounded by a finite value. It is beneficial to ensure numerical stability. Third, the motion of the interface can be described by geometric features. It is helpful for expressing natural phenomena in mathematical terms. Fourth, the phase-field equations possess the energy dissipation law. This law is about degeneration and decay. It tells us in thermodynamics that all occurrences are irreversible processes. In this paper, we would like to investigate the numerical implementation of the Allen–Cahn (AC) equation, which is the classical one of the phase-field equations. In phase field modeling, the binary phase system is described using a continuous variable called the order parameter. The order parameter can be categorized into two forms: conserved, which represents the physical property such as concentration or mass, and non-conserved, which does not have the conserved physical property. We consider both the non-conservative and conservative AC equations. Our interest is more precisely to scrutinize the utilization of the discrete Laplacian operator in the AC equation by considering the conservative and non-conservative order parameter \ensuremath{\phi}. Constructing linearly implicit methods for solving the AC equation, we formulate a gradient-descent-like scheme. Therefore, reinterpreting the implicit scheme for the AC equation, we propose a novel numerical scheme in which solutions are bounded by 1 for all t \&gt; 0. Together with the conservative Allen–Cahn equation, our proposed scheme is consistent when mass is conserved as well. From a numerical point of view, a linear, unconditionally energy stable splitting scheme is transformed into a gradient-descent-like scheme. Various numerical simulations are illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme. We also make distinctions between the proposed one and existing numerical schemes.},

However, the triple thermal plasma system has been applied for nanomaterial synthesis and exhibited results overcoming these limitations. This study used the triple thermal plasma system to investigate the most suitable conditions for CH4 pyrolysis. CH4 conversion rate and selectivity of H2 and C2H2 were analyzed by varying the CH4 flow rate and quenching conditions at a fixed power supply of approximately 30~kW, and the specific energy requirement (SER) per 1~kg H2 was compared with that of previous works. The maximum conversion rate was 97\% at 50~L/min of CH4, which is approximately 7\% higher than earlier studies under conditions with similar process enthalpy. In addition, the conversion of CH4 to C2H2 and further to heavier hydrocarbons proceeded one order of magnitude faster than the reaction time expected by the gas-phase reaction. This result is attributed to the easy penetration of CH4 into the core region with the highest temperature and the strong interaction between the processing gas and graphite surface due to the arrangement of the torches in the triple plasma system. C2H2 selectivity was relatively high, while it was less affected by the increase in the quenching gas than generally expected. This finding was attributed to the naturally fast quenching rate without quenching gas due to the structure expanding from the first to the second graphite. While quenching can enhance selectivity by stabilizing the radicals as intermediates such as H2 or C2H2, it depressed the following reaction with dehydrogenation. Thus, the quenching conditions must be optimized. Finally, we demonstrated that the triple thermal plasma enhanced CH4 pyrolysis regarding H2 production efficiency.},

  abstract      = {The anaerobic conversion of surplus hydrogen to methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogen in an anaerobic digester has been attempted to overcome the drawbacks of hydrogen uselessly escaped from small or middle-scale industries. A biochemical methane potential test was thus performed to evaluate the methane production from hydrogen and carbon dioxide (H2/CO2~=~4:1) injected directly into the reactors at mesophilic temperature (38~\textdegree{}C) for 30 days. The cumulative methane yield increased stepwise, ultimately reaching a maximum of 143.94 NmL CH4/g VSadd at the end of the experiment, which was 56\% higher than the control. After 7 days of incubation, the methane content in the biogas accounted for about 90\%, whereas the control showed 10\% lower than that. The kinetic study showed the injection of H2/CO2 could reduce the rate of hydrolysis, verifying that the experimental data fit the first-order model better. In the meantime, microbial community analysis showed an increase in relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales, in the sludge obtained after the test compared to before, indicating the increased methane yield was dominantly attributed to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. This study demonstrated that H2/CO2 injection directly into the anaerobic digester was feasible for ultimately enhancing the quality of biogas.},

A compelling paradigm that could bring the full potential of metamaterials to fruition is emerging: data-driven design. This review provides a holistic overview of this rapidly evolving field, emphasizing the general methodology instead of specific domains and deployment contexts. Existing research is organized into data-driven modules, encompassing data acquisition, machine learning-based unit cell design, and data-driven multiscale optimization. The approaches are further categorized within each module based on shared principles, analyze and compare strengths and applicability, explore connections between different modules, and identify open research questions and opportunities.},

  abstract      = {Methane to olefins, aromatics, and hydrogen (MTOAH) has received considerable attention because it can potentially provide an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method for converting methane into valuable compounds. However, the optimization of the MTOAH process significantly hinders its economic feasibility because methane pyrolysis in the MTOAH process consumes considerable energy and carbon resources and requires several control factors. In this study, focusing on methane pyrolysis in the gas phase, a method for improving the MTOAH process with a hydrocarbon effect was successfully developed using metaheuristic optimization based on machine learning (ML) models. Because the trained ML models reasonably predicted various reaction outcomes, metaheuristic methods coupled with these ML models could optimize the reaction parameters to achieve the maximum hydrocarbon yield. By constructing score functions, various reaction conditions with maximum hydrocarbon yields and different coke selectivities were proposed. This provides key evidence for understanding the reaction mechanism and presents strategies for developing a sustainable cokeless catalytic reactor. Moreover, the importance of acetylene and the synergistic effect of hydrocarbon on the MTOAH process was verified using ML models. The optimal hydrocarbon content for cofeeding was determined based on the reaction temperature, but can be achieved at lower temperatures by loading a catalyst in a pre-gas phase reactor. Thus, our findings of the prioritization of the reaction parameters on the MTOAH mechanism will facilitate the development of a sustainable catalytic reactor under mild reaction conditions.},

  abstract      = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is considered essential for climate change mitigation, and a fast and accurate model is necessary for its control and operation in practical applications. In this study, various machine learning methods are used to develop data-based models for PEMFC performance attributes and internal states. Techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine Regressor (SVR) are used to predict the cell voltage, membrane resistance, and membrane hydration level for various operating conditions. Varying input features such as cell current, temperature, reactant pressures, and humidity are introduced to evaluate the accuracy of the model, especially under extreme conditions. Two different sets of data are considered in this study, which are acquired from, a physics-based semiempirical model and a 1-D reduced-dimension Computational Fluid Dynamics model, respectively. The aspect of data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning procedures are investigated that are extensively used to calibrate the artificial neural network layers and support vector regressor to predict the fuel cell attributes. ANN clearly shows an advantage in comparison with SVR, especially on a multivariable output regression. However, the SVR is advantageous to model simple regressions as it greatly reduces the level of computation without sacrificing accuracy. Data-based models for PEMFC are successfully developed on both the data sets by adapting advanced modeling techniques and calibration procedures such as ANN incorporating the dropout technique, resulting in an R2 \geq{} 0.99 for all the predicted variables, demonstrating the ability to build accurate data-based models solely on data from validated physics-based models, reducing the dependency on extensive experimentation.},

  abstract      = {A generalized description of the rebound of spherical drops or solid spheres over a wall is proposed using two parameters: a coefficient of restitution that compares the velocity of restitution to the velocity before impact and the contact time with the wall. During the bouncing, the incident kinetic energy is transferred into deformation energy (stored on the surface for the case of liquid drops or in the bulk for the case of solid particles) and then restored into kinetic energy allowing the particle to leave or not the wall. The corresponding criteria is given by the Stokes number that compares the inertia of the particle (added mass included) and the viscous force exerted on the particle during the drainage of the film formed between the particle and the wall. The general behavior of the coefficient of restitution observed in many experiments can be modelled for solid spheres as well as spherical drops by the use of a unique simple correlation depending on this Stokes number. For solid particles, the contact time with the wall in viscous flows is found to be of the same order as that predicted by the Hertzian theory; hence, the contact with the wall can be described as a discontinuity in the particle motion. On the other hand, for liquid drops, the contact time is significant and of the same order as other characteristic time scales of the particle motion. Therefore, to properly describe the rebound process, both a restitution coefficient and a contact time must be considered. Finally, a simple model is proposed and its predictions are compared with experiments performed for millimetric toluene drops in water.},

Liquid/solid fluidized bed heat exchangers have originally been developed for desalination plants. However, due to their substantial benefits with respect to significantly improved heat transfer and fouling reduction, successful applications also exist in areas such as petrochemical, minerals and food processing as well as in the paper and power industries. The excellent performance of fluidized bed heat exchangers is related to the interaction between particles and heat transfer surface and to mixing effects in the viscous sublayer. In this paper, the results of experimental investigations on heat transfer for a wide range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are presented. New design equations have been developed for the prediction of bed voidage and heat transfer coefficients. The predictions of these correlations and of numerous correlations recommended by other authors are compared with a large database compiled from the literature. Experiments were carried out in monodisperse suspensions at which particles consisting of uniform suspension, caused to fall down counter-currently against an upflow of water in a vertical tube. The solid concentration was measured to determine particle velocity. The total solid concentration ranged from 5\% to 45\% by volume. A correction factor of (voidage)0.2 applied to the model of Garside and Al-Dibouni (1977), gives satisfactory results for reduced velocity at intermediate particle Reynolds number. The data obtained for monodisperse suspensions were tested against the published models. The modified model gives a mean sum of squares of residuals 0.0004 as well as better results than the other models in the flow range 150 {\$<\$} Re {\$<\$} 2200. Theoretical and empirical approaches to the fluid dynamic description of liquid fluidised beds are reviewed, together with the relevant experimental evidence. Attention has been focused, in the main, on steady- and unsteady-state phenomena relating to monocomponent fluidised beds, with one section devoted to binary-solid systems, the particles differing in size and/or in density. Accurate prediction of the bed voidage is essential for the calculation of liquid side heat transfer coefficients in fluidized bed heat exchangers. New experimental results for the bed voidage in annuli are presented. Various published correlations are tabulated and the inadequacy of most of these correlations is demonstrated. The most recently published correlation of Hirata and Bulos in conjunction with the Richardson--Zaki model predicts bed voidage in annuli with a standard deviation of about 6\%. The flow characteristics of inverse fluidization utilizing low density spherical particles are experimentally investigated for both the liquid--solid and gas--liquid--solid systems. The experimental data for the bed expansion in the liquid-solid system are correlated, both empirically and semi-empirically. In the gas--liquid--solid system in which the gas and liquid flows are countercurrent, two modes of fluidization are examined. They are fluidization with the liquid as a continuous phase and fluidization with the gas as a continuous phase; the former characterizes the inverse gas--liquid--solid fluidized bed, while the latter characterizes the turbulent contacting bed. A flow regime diagram which portrays these modes of fluidization is presented. Correlations of the bed expansion and gas hold-up are proposed for the inverse gas--liquid--solid fluidization.},

  abstract      = {An analytical model for gas-solid suspension flow through an inclined section of pipe was developed. This model predicts the ratio of the total pressure drop in an inclined pipe to that of a horizontal pipe. The model has been used to predict the critical pipe angle, which is defined as the angle at which the maximum pressure drop for a given solids flow rate is achieved. This angle differs from 90\textdegree{} (found in a single-phase flow) and is directly proportional to the ratio between the gas superficial velocity and the particle terminal velocity. The three-dimensional conservation equations for steady-state two-phase flow in an inclined pipe were solved numerically for constant solids and gas flow rates at different pipe inclinations. This model was based on the continuum theory for describing the mass and momentum balance equations for the fluid and solid phases. A packing model, describing the shear stress of the solid phase as a function of its volume fraction, is suggested in order to limit the maximum value of the solid volume fraction. A new model for particle-wall interaction was developed taking into account the angle of inclination of the pipe. The prediction of the numerical model was compared with experimental data obtained in a specially designed test rig. In general, the agreement between the experimental data and the models was satisfactory. The results of the numerical simulation also confirmed that the critical pipe angle for gas-solid flow is lower than 90\textdegree{}. The assumptions made during the development of the models were assessed in order to explain the differences between the predicted and measured values of the flow parameters for different flow regimes. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

As soon as either the particles can dominate the fluid, or the fluid can dominate the particles, the dissipative structure either dissolves or a newly formed coexisting uniform structure appears. At this transition point, operating conditions and material properties alone become insufficient to ensure the steady state. Quantification of such a complicated structure calls for some mode of multiple resolution, for instance, it could be resolved with respect first to scale and then to amplitude and periodicity.

In the dispersed phase, the solid particles are noted to be present essentially individually, while in the cluster phase the solid particles agglomerate with one another and are enmeshed in the dispersed phase. The shape of clusters is in general irregular, and their size, highly variable. It seems that the clusters transform from strands at the center of the bed into spheres near the wall.

The measurement results showed that (1) although clusters behave in a transient nature, sometimes aggregating and sometimes dispersing, the local time-averaged cluster lengths remain almost constant radially in the core region of both the upper dilute section and the lower dense section, but the local time-averaged cluster lengths in lower dense section are larger than those in the upper dilute section. (2) Cluster motion velocities are in direct proportion to the superficial gas velocity. In the lower dense section the probabilities of upward motion and downward motion are basically equal; but in the upper dilute section, most of the dusters move upwards. However, near the wall region of both the upper and lower section, the probability of downward motion is bigger than that of upward motion. (3) The fast fluidized bed is a bed of fluidized clusters. There are two phases in fast fluidized bed: a dispersed phase and a duster phase. In the dispersed phase the particles present essentially as individuals, while in the cluster phase the particles agglomerate with one another and are enmeshed in the dispersed phase. The motion behavior of dusters in the lower dense section and the upper dilute section are similar to the motion behavior of particles in the lower dense region and the upper freeboard region of a bubbling fluidized bed, respectively.},

With such a strategy, a comprehensive model is developed on the basis of the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) approach. The model is capable of predicting the saturation carrying capacity and the steady states at both the top and the bottom of an S-shaped axial pro"le. Comparison between the model prediction and available experimental data shows reasonable agreement. In addition, the overall strategy adopted in the EMMS approach is also discussed with updated concepts. It is concluded that the variational criterion (or something equivalent) in analyzing heterogeneous two-phase systems is indispensable unless the observation scale can be su\$ciently small.

Particle–fluid compromise is recognized to be the origin of the multi-scale dissipative structure in the system, to which multiple resolution is applied, leading to the establishment of the variational criterion for stability and the critical condition for choking. The dynamic behavior of such a heterogeneous structure in fluidized systems is formulated by carrying out wavelet analysis and resolving the whole process with respect first to scale, and then, to time and amplitude. Average approaches, as commonly used, are considered to be inadequate to describe transport behaviors in gas–solid fluidization. Discrete computer simulation on micro-scale is regarded to be a promising approach to further understanding of the complicated mechanism of particle–fluid interaction. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Two widely applied methane pyrolysis profiles, i.e., pre-mixing methane and argon before fed into plasma torch, and injecting methane into pure argon plasma jet at torch outlet, were compared. Performances of methane pyrolysis regarding to methane conversion, acetylene selectivity, acetylene specific energy requirement (SER), and plasma stability were concluded. Results showed that pre-mixing methane and argon before fed into plasma torch would be efficient in converting methane and acetylene production, with higher conversion of methane and lower SER to acetylene at a given specific energy. Also, methane in arc zone would cause periodic fluctuations of plasma voltage and power, which could be reduced by controlling methane fraction in feed. On the other hand, when methane was injected into argon plasma jet at torch outlet, the energy efficiency in converting methane and producing acetylene would be lower. And the plasma would barely participate in the reaction other than providing heat, but the erosion of electrode was much slower and slighter. It was also validated that the SER of acetylene was limited by the thermal loss of the setup due to size-effect of reactor.},

This work aims to develop a multiscale model that directly resolves the largescale cavities and models small discrete bubbles. The volume of fluid (VOF) method and the Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model are first adopted to represent the phase field of water and vapor from a macroscale point of view. A discrete bubble model (DBM) based on the Lagrangian formulation is then developed to simulate the microscale cavitation bubbles that are smoothed in the macroscale model due to the limited mesh resolution. The transition between DBM and VOF is also implemented to achieve the multiscale simulation. For modeling of the turbulence, the scale adaptive simulation approach is used. The tip-leakage cavitating flows induced by the NACA0009 hydrofoil under the conditions with different gaps according to the reported experiment are simulated. Results show that, using the proposed multiscale model, better agreements can be obtained compared with the macroscale model, and specific phenomena can be well revealed including the bubble nucleation, growth and collapse, the interaction between discrete bubbles and large-scale cavities.},

The H2 reduction reaction kinetics and fluidization characteristics of fine and cohesive Fe2O3 particles were examined in a vibrated fluidized bed reactor. A smooth bubbling fluidization was achieved. An increase in external force due to vibration slightly increased the pressure drop. The minimum fluidization velocity was nearly independent of the operating temperature. The yield of the direct H2-driven reduction was examined and found to exceed 90\%, with a maximum of 98\% under the vibration of \textasciitilde 47 Hz with an amplitude of 0.6 mm, and operating temperatures close to 500 \textdegree{}C. Towards the future of direct steel ore reduction, cheap and ``green'' hydrogen sources need to be developed. H2 can be formed through various techniques with the catalytic decomposition of NH3 (and CH4), methanol and ethanol offering an important potential towards production cost, yield and environmental CO2 emission reductions.},

Meanwhile, the volume of fluid (VOF) method is suitable for resolving the interface, while the discrete particle model (DPM) under the Lagrangian frame better simulates unresolvable particles; a multiscale VOF–DPM combined model is urgently needed for multiscale multiphase flows. The present work implements a VOF–DPM solver that includes a two-way transition algorithm to model the transformation between discrete and continuous phases for bubbles or droplets using OpenFOAM. The interface-capturing scheme in the solver is based on the interIsoFoam solver, which supports the geometric reconstruction of the interface and adaptive mesh refinement. A connected component labeling approach is used for particle detection and VOF-to-DPM transition for discrete bubbles or droplets produced by interface breakup. Conversely, a DPM-to-VOF transition algorithm for particles touching the interface is incorporated to achieve a twoway transition. In addition, phase change modeling between continuous phases and bubble dynamic modeling for cavitating flow cases are also implemented in the solver. Test simulations are performed for validation, including the gas–liquid two-phase dam break and cavitating flow in a convergent–divergent test section. The results demonstrate that the solver is reasonably accurate and can adequately represent the complex phase structure, including the interface and discrete particles.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable energy source due to its abundant feedstock availability and the significant reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions compared with fossil fuels. Microbial conversion of biomass often leads to bioproducts that can serve as platform chemicals and fuels. Effective production and utilization of these bioproducts require new chemical processes with high product yields from biomass and effective separation of bioproducts to achieve the desired purity and recoveries. Significant efforts have been made in (1) exploiting enzymes and reaction solvents that promote conversions and (2) leveraging various separation agents including heat, work, and separation solvent to break the separation bottleneck. Process intensification is a promising technique to further reduce energy and material consumption, economic investment, and carbon emissions. Process intensification can be achieved by combining multiple reaction and separation phenomena, e.g., reaction/reaction, separation/separation, or reaction/separation. Challenges exist in the systematic exploration of intensification pathways that achieve optimal process targets. In this aspect, machine learning is a potential technique for the systematic exploration of process design space by connecting input as process flowsheet graph descriptors and output as design targets. In this chapter, we summarize the background and technical development for biomass valorization. Then, we introduce key concepts and methodologies of process intensification and applications of intensification methods for biomass valorization. We illustrate concepts and techniques using practical examples, including production of sustainable plastics and biofuels.},

To simulate the multiphase systems, the authors' group has developed a numerical method that couples the discrete element method (DEM) and the volume of fluid (VOF) method, where the local volume average technique is employed. When the unresolved DEM-VOF method is applied to industrial systems, there are two critical problems: one is the inflexibility to select the grid size for the gas–liquid–flow simulations, and the other is the heavy computational cost due to a large number of particles. To solve these problems, a novel numerical method is proposed by introducing the refined grid model and coarse-grained model into the unresolved DEM-VOF method. Two types of verification tests are performed to illustrate the adequacy of the new method. First, a water entry problem of solid particles is simulated to verify the combination of the refined grid model and the unresolved DEM-VOF method. Second, a gas–solid–liquid fluidized bed system is computed to verify the combination of the refined grid model, the coarse-grained DEM method, and the unresolved DEM-VOF method. Through the verification tests, it is demonstrated that the new method can flexibly give the grid size for the VOF regardless of the solid particle size. Besides, the new approach makes it possible to reduce the calculation time of the DEM to 4.6\% of the original time. The new approach will drastically improve the numerical modeling for gas–solid–liquid flows from the viewpoint of efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility.},

The internal flow behavior of the surface texture significantly impacts its performance. In this study, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is constructed to explore the internal flow behavior of the straight-groove texture in the thrust bearing. The influences of the Reynolds number, depth ratio, and area ratio of the straight-groove texture on the internal flow behavior are systematically investigated. Furthermore, the streamline and tribological performance parameters are checked to reveal the mechanism of the groove texture influencing the tribological properties. It is found that the vortex and cavitation significantly affect the tribological performance of textured surfaces under hydrodynamic lubrication. The cavitation and upstream vortex areas increase with the Reynolds number, while the downstream vortex area shows a reverse trend. The increase in depth ratio strengthens the upstream and downstream vortexes while reducing the cavitation area. Additionally, a method is proposed to determine the location of the cavitation within the groove texture. Certain operating conditions create the optimal texture depth ratio and area ratio, which could maximize the load-carrying capacity (LCC) of the oil film, and the friction coefficient is relatively small.},

They may generate strong shock waves that lead to catastrophic consequences to personnel and structures in the vicinity. Despite the great interest in safety management and intensive research efforts, reliable and efficient prediction of BLEVE loads on structures is still challenging in practice. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), based on complex physics formulas, can provide more accurate predictions of BLEVE loads than the traditional empirical and TNT-equivalency approaches, but suffers from high computational costs. Data-driven machine learning models offer efficient surrogates but conventional models, including commonly used multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are suboptimal especially for explosions of complex geometry and in complex environment. In this study, a novel machine learning approach, based on the state-of-the-art Transformer neural networks, is developed for BLEVE loads prediction on an idealised structure in the vicinity of BLEVE. Through extensive experiments and rigorous evaluation, it is shown that Transformer can effectively model the structure-wave interaction, yielding accurate pressure and impulse predictions with less than 14\% relative errors, which outperforms widely used MLP (20\% error) significantly. The developed Transformer model is applied to predict critical parameters of BLEVE loads, including arrive time, rise time and duration. The results demonstrate that Transformer can produce an accurate pressure-time history, yielding a comprehensive characterisation of BLEVE loads on structures.},

Vertical reactors use high-pressure pneumatic stirring, which has high energy consumption and poor stirring performance. Horizontal reactors use long-uniaxial mechanical stirring, which occupies large land areas and has high strength requirements for stirring shaft material. In addition, during the operation of the two reactor types, the continuous liquefaction of the solid waste produces solid-liquid stratification, thus affecting mixing effects and decreasing the reactor volume rate. To solve the above problems, we designed a new simulated intestinal anaerobic digestion reactor with a natural solid-liquid separation system, short-axis mechanical stirring, and a stirring blade optimized through CFD. Use of the solid-liquid separation system increased the solid content in the reactor by 44\%–55\%. The operation results indicated that the homogenization of the solid waste with the optimal stirring blade was more than 50\% greater than that of a conventional vertical reactor. The intestinal reactor solves the problems of poor uniformity and solid content decrease during anaerobic digestion in traditional HSAD, decreases the strength requirements for stirring shaft material, and has potential to increase urban waste treatment capacity.},

On the theoretical side, we provided a modified Rayleigh collapse time and natural frequency for spherical bubbles in our particular context, characterized by the density ratio between the two liquids and the bubble-to-droplet size ratio. Regarding the experimental aspect, experiments were carried out for laser-induced cavitation bubbles inside oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) droplets. Two distinct fluid-mixing mechanisms were unveiled in the two systems, respectively. In the case of O/W droplets, a liquid jet emerges around the end of the bubble collapse phase, effectively penetrating the droplet interface. We offer a detailed analysis of the criteria governing jet penetration, involving the standoff parameter and impact velocity of the bubble jet on the droplet surface. Conversely, in the scenario involving W/O droplets, the bubble traverses the droplet interior, inducing global motion and eventually leading to droplet pinch-off when the local Weber number exceeds a critical value. This phenomenon is elucidated through the equilibrium between interfacial and kinetic energies. Lastly, our boundary integral model faithfully reproduces the essential physics of the non-spherical bubble dynamics observed in the experiments. We conduct a parametric study spanning a wide parameter space to investigate bubble–droplet interactions. The insights from this study could serve as a valuable reference for practical applications in the field of ultrasonic emulsification, pharmacy, etc.},

Key methodological enablers consist of Bayesian optimization, a surrogate model enhanced by deep learning and persistent data topology for physical interpretation. The mixing performance is characterized by an equivalent jet radius (ReqReqR\_\{eq\}) derived from the streamwise velocity in a plane located 888 diameters downstream. The optimization is performed in a 22-dimensional actuation space that comprises most known excitations. This search space parameterizes the distributed actuation imposed on the bulk flow and at the periphery of the nozzle in the streamwise and radial directions. The momentum flux measures the energy input of the actuation. The optimization quadruples the jet radius ReqReqR\_\{eq\} with a 777-armed blooming jet after around 570570570 evaluations. The control input requires 2\%2\%2\textbackslash,\textbackslash\% momentum flux of the main flow, which is one order of magnitude lower than an ad hoc dual-mode excitation. Intriguingly, a pronounced suboptimum in the search space is associated with a double-helix jet, a new flow pattern. This jet pattern results in a mixing improvement comparable to the blooming jet. A state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization converges towards this double-helix solution. The learning is accelerated and converges to another better optimum by including a deep-learning-enhanced surrogate model trained along the optimization. Persistent data topology extracts the global and many local minima in the actuation space. These minima can be identified with flow patterns beneficial to the mixing.},

  abstract      = {The combination of limestone calcination, catalytic methane reforming, and combustion in one reactor (MRCCAL) was previously proposed to achieve autothermal and hydrogen-producing sorbent regeneration for calcium-looping technology. However, this technology was only assessed using kinetic-only simulations. To further evaluate its viability, the present study developed an Eulerian-Eulerian CFD model with full reaction kinetics in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Three different operating parameters were studied: the inlet gas velocity, the sorbent to catalyst ratio, and the sorbent calcination extent. CFD simulations demonstrated that increasing the inlet gas velocity increased the H2 production by altering the particle distribution through the bed. Decreasing the catalyst-to-sorbent ratio improved local mixing whereas the catalyst tended to locate at the bottom of the bed where an increased total solid holdup was also found. Sorbents with higher calcination extent led to a decreased CO2 composition in the off-gas whilst increasing the H2 composition. When compared with kinetic-only simulations of a continuous reactor, the CFD results showed a noticeable discrepancy in the gas compositions mainly due to the free gas expansion and the more rigorous calculation of the particle mixing patterns, which were not included in the kinetic simulations. The sharp differences emphasized the importance of hydrodynamics in developing novel processes.},

We extend the classic porous electrode theory by incorporating a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field appraoch to account for the phase-separation of LixC6, and we consider hierarchical pore structures at both electrode and par- ticle scales using the method of volume averaging. Our hierarchical multiphase porous electrode theory is rigorously examined in Li/graphite half-cells with identical graphite materials but different capacities and fast charging condition. By obtaining all parameters through experiments, or ab initio calculations, our model quantitatively agrees with measured cell voltages profiles, and, more impor- tantly, experimentally determined onset of lithium plating across multiple fast charging conditions.},

  abstract      = {Experiments consisting of dense-phase pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal using nitrogen were carried out in an experimental test facility, with a conveying pressure of up to 4 MPa. The influences of the conveying differential pressure, the coal moisture content, the gas volume flow rate and the superficial velocity, on the solid-gas ratios, were investigated. The Shannon entropy analysis of the pressure fluctuation time series was developed to reveal the flow characteristics. By investigation of the distribution of the Shannon entropy at different conditions, the flow stability and the evolutional tendency of Shannon entropy, in different regimes and regime transition processes, were revealed, and the relationship between Shannon entropy and the flow regime was also established. The results indicate that the solid-gas ratio and the Shannon entropy rise with increases in conveying differential pressure. The solid-gas ratio and the Shannon entropy reveal preferable correlation with the superficial gas velocity. Shannon entropy is different for different flow regimes, and can be used to identify the flow regimes. Both the mass flow rate and the Shannon entropy, decrease with increases in moisture content. Shannon entropy analysis is a feasible approach to researching the characteristics of the flow regime, the flow stability and the flow regime transitions in dense-phase pneumatic conveying systems, at high pressure.},

  abstract      = {Pumps and turbines are widely used in marine engineering, and hydrofoil cavitation, a fundamental form of pump and turbine cavitation, is often used as a simplified hydraulic model to study cavitation issues. However, oceans and lakes contain many particulate impurities that can exacerbate the instability of the cavitation flow field around hydrofoils. Currently, there are few studies on solid particle-induced cavitation in hydrofoils. To investigate the influence of small particles on blade cavitation, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 0006 hydrofoil was used as a simplified blade model. Using the large eddy simulation-volume of fluid method and the discrete phase model, the three-dimensional cavitation flow field around the hydrofoil was analyzed for nine different particle sizes at a 3\% particle concentration and compared to the flow field in clean water. The results show that small particles cannot penetrate the bubble film but move along the surface of the cavity, slightly increasing the vortex and turbulence intensity within the cavitation flow field, thereby promoting cavitation development and reducing the hydrofoil's hydrodynamic performance. As particle size increases, the overall effect of particle number becomes stronger, while the reduction of particle number leads to a reduced impact of small particles on the cavitation flow field.},

The results of the monosaccharide composition demonstrated that hydrodynamic cavitation treatment made the branched structure of endogenous pectin more pronounced. Results of XRD and FTIR analysis showed that the hydrodynamic cavitation treatment resulted in limited changes to the crystallinity and skeletal structure of pectin from Huyou juice. HC treatment enhanced the thermogravimetric stability of pectin in Huyou juice, with NSP exhibiting the highest stability. Additionally, HC treatment altered the rheological properties of the pectin fractions. In addition, correlation analysis was carried out to analyze the relationship between hydrodynamic cavitation and each component and index. In summary, the cavitation effect produced by hydrodynamic cavitation treatment could reduce the activity of PME in Huyou juice, change the linear structure of endogenous pectin and reduce the molecular weight and esterification degree of endogenous pectin, improving the turbidity stability of Huyou juice.},

  abstract      = {Over the last decade, deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning, has experienced rapid progress. Powerful tools for tasks that have been traditionally complex to automate have been developed, such as image synthesis and natural language processing. In the context of simulating fluid dynamics, this has led to a series of novel DL methods for replacing or augmenting conventional numerical solvers. We broadly classify these methods into physics- and data-driven methods. Physics-driven methods, generally, tune a DL model to provide an analytical and differentiable solution to a given fluid dynamics problem by minimizing the residuals of the governing partial differential equations. Data-driven methods provide a fast and approximate solution to any fluid dynamics problem that shares some physical properties with the observations used when tuning the DL model's parameters. Meanwhile, the symbiosis of numerical solvers and DL has led to promising results in turbulence modelling and accelerating iterative solvers. However, these methods present some challenges. Exclusively data-driven flow simulators often suffer from poor extrapolation, error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, as well as difficulties in training against turbulent flows. Substantial effort is, therefore, being invested into approaches that may improve the current~state~of~the art.},

  abstract      = {The performance of fluidized beds is strongly influenced by bubble behavior. Among various hydrodynamic properties, bubble size distributions are of prime concern, but in practice, bubble size is not readily measured. When a probe is used to determine bubble size, it intersects a bubble with a chord length other than the largest vertical dimension. The relationships between the size distribution of bubbles in the bed, the size distribution of bubbles touching the probe and the distribution of chord lengths must be resolved for correct interpretation of probe signals. A method for translating statistical parameters, namely mean and standard deviation of chord lengths to mean and standard deviation of bubble sizes, and an approach to infer the size distribution of bubbles touching the probe and the size distribution of bubbles in the bed system by using the distribution of chord lengths measured by a probe in closed form are proposed for the first time.},

A particle acceleration region and a fully developed region were identified along the column from the pressure gradient profiles. In the fully developed region, solids holdup decreases with the gas velocity but increases linearly with the solids circulation rate. The latter results in nearly constant particle velocities over a large range of solids flux at given gas velocities. Particle velocity also increases linearly with the gas velocity. Particle properties seem not to affect the mean particle velocity much, but smaller andror lighter particles give larger solid holdups. A solids holdup as high as 10–20\% has been achieved. Comparison of the results obtained here with those from an upflow riser shows inherent similarities between the two gas–solids co-current flow systems. In the fully developed region, the apparent solids holdup calculated from the pressure gradient agreed well with the actual solids holdup measured by a pair of pinch valves under not very high gas velocities, but was underestimated at higher gas velocities due to the increased wall friction loss. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fines smaller than 20 Am contribute 24.5\% in volume in the WSD particles. Phosphor tracer method is used. The axial backmixing of the WSD is slightly lower than the NSD. However, the lateral solids Peclet number increases linearly with the increase of the content of fines smaller than 20 Am because of the serious agglomeration of the fines, which leads to very poor lateral mixing for the WSD particles. And the solids lateral mixing for the WSD particles decreases significantly with increasing solids fraction. These results show that the particle size and the particle-size-distribution is a very important factor that controls the lateral solids mixing and hence the heat and mass transfer in lateral direction, which should be taken into full consideration in the riser reactor. And the NSD may be a good particle size distribution for the FCC riser, the lateral solids mixing of which is satisfactory in the reactor.},

It is found that nonlinear characteristics of the wall temperature time series vary with spatial position in the evaporator at given operation conditions, and thus the multi-phase flow boiling behavior. However, the signals obtained at given axial position but different heated tubes in the evaporator exhibit more similar nonlinear evolution behavior, and those measured in the same heated tube but at different axial heights in the evaporator undergo more distinct nonlinear dynamic behavior. Multi-scale phenomena in different spatial positions are also found and discussed. These transient aspects of inner wall temperatures are closely related to the average holdup of solid particles and motion of vapor bubbles in vapor–liquid–solid flow.

  abstract      = {To recover alumina and silica from alumina rich fly ash, a predesilication process has been developed to extract glassy amorphous silica from the fly ash. The predesilication apparent reaction kinetics in 15 wt-\% NaOH solution were studied. The results showed that the predesilication process followed a shrinking unreacted core model of decreasing particle size. The apparent reaction rate of the predesilication process was predominantly controlled by internal diffusion, then by chemical reaction and last by fluid film diffusion. The apparent reaction activation energy for the process was found to be 14\cdot{}2 kJ mol-1 and the pre-exponential factor was 0\cdot{}024. Using the leaching process, about 57\cdot{}56\% of glassy amorphous silica was removed from alumina rich fly ash, the silica content being reduced from 40\cdot{}20 to 26\cdot{}96\% in the resulting dried desilicated fly ash. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the separation of alumina and silica and the design of a predesilication reactor.},

The effects of various parameters, which were ultrasonic time,ultrasonic power, solid-water ratio and solid-ethyl acetate ratio on the extraction rate of sulforaphane were investigated. The results showed that microwave pretreatment enhanced sulforaphane formation. Excessive size reduction did not increase or even reduced extraction rate of sulforaphane. Simultaneous hydrolysis and extraction significantly increased extraction rate of sulforaphane compared to hydrolysis followed by extraction. UAE accelerated mass transfer and the solubilization of the targeted compounds due to the acoustic cavitation effect, thus enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of glucoraphanin and the extraction rate of sulforaphane. The extraction rate of sulforaphane using UAE with simultaneous hydrolysis and extraction was 4.07-fold of the conventional extraction method. UAE was an effective method to extract sulforaphane from broccoli seeds since it led to higher yield of sulforaphane in a much shorter extraction time.},

In this work, the flow regimes in the two-dimensional \ensuremath{\mu}PBR were systematically studied by visual method utilizing a high-performance camera. Four typical flow regimes and characteristics were captured, and flow regime transition was revealed. Effects of gas and liquid superficial velocities, liquid physical properties, and particle sizes on liquid spreading areal fraction and pressure drop were investigated. Flow regime transition correlation of churn flow and pseudo-static flow in the \ensuremath{\mu}PBR was provided for the first time based on the summary of the current and previous published results.},

A high 2-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (2-TBQ) yield of 73\% was achieved within 6 min. Moreover, a quantitative method to assess the mass transfer of gas–liquid segmented flow in practical reaction was developed by introducing a circulation frequency, fcir, which could provide theoretical guidance to predict operating conditions for the scale-up production. The 2-TBQ productivity is significantly increased from 0.0061 to 0.5068 kg/h, that is, an increase of 83 times, by selective dimension enlarging from 2 mm to 4.35 mm with predicted operating conditions.},

The obtained results indicate that the addition of metal ions in pure water strengthens the dynamic effect of cavitation collapse. When the cavitation collapses, it is capable of releasing a high temperature and transferring it to the surface of the stainless steel in a short time. Then, through the rapid cooling of the pure water environment, the martensitic structure is generated, but the presence of a massive amount of metal ions leads to a decrease in the speed of heat conduction and absorption of some heat. After the collapse of the bubble, the passivation film on the surface of the stainless steel incorporates into the creation of initial micropores. A concentration difference and a growth of the current density at the bottom of the hole, as well as a reduction in the pH value are detectable. Compared with pure water, 3.5\% NaCl solution contains more free ions and its local current density is higher, so its corrosion resistance is worse.},

To get a better understanding of the agglomeration mechanism, the (de-)fluidization behavior of micron-sized iron oxide particles in a 3-D fluidized bed is investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics coupled with a coarse-grained Discrete Element Method (CFD-cgDEM). The inter-particle cohesive force is considered as a temperature-dependent solid bridge force. The coarse-grained method is first verified by comparing results for different scaling factors. Subsequently, the effects of temperature on the bed pressure drop, void fraction distribution, particle velocity distribution, and agglomerate size are investigated. In conclusion, the developed model shows the capacity for reliable prediction of particle agglomeration behavior, which can shed light on the design of the DRI process in high-temperature fluidized beds.},

Our results demonstrated significant variation in the catalytic activity of the metal catalysts. 5 wt \% Rh/Al2O3 and 5 wt \% Pt/Al2O3 showed the highest activity for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation with the highest selectivity and turnover frequency (TOF), respectively. Conversely, 5 wt \% Pd/Al2O3 and 5 wt \% Ru/Al2O3 exhibited lower catalytic activity toward full hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Rh/Al2O3 showed the best catalytic hydrogenation activity with a TOF of 26.49 h–1 and a hydrogenation degree of 92.69\% in 2 h, while Pt/Al2O3 exhibited the best catalytic dehydrogenation activity with a released H2 volume of 3755 mL, a dehydrogenation degree of 78.23\%, and a TOF of 39.56 h–1 in 2 h. Additionally, we estimated the activation energies for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation to be 67.20 and 82.78 kJ/mol, respectively. Notably, the produced hydrogen gas was of high purity and suitable for use in fuel cells. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to analyze the adsorption structure and reaction energy changes of all intermediate products of DBT on the surface of the chosen catalysts.

To understand the work that has been done in the area, we present a systematic survey and literature review of CS Education studies. We search for research that is both related to algorithm design and evaluated on undergraduate-level students. Across all papers in the ACM Digital Library prior to August 2023, we only find 94 such papers. We first classify these papers by topic, evaluation metric, evaluation methods, and intervention target. Through our classification, we find a broad sparsity of papers which indicates that many open questions remain about teaching algorithm design, with each algorithm topic only being discussed in between 0 and 10 papers. We also note the need for papers using rigorous research methods, as only 38 out of 88 papers presenting quantitative data use statistical tests, and only 15 out of 45 papers presenting qualitative data use a coding scheme. Only 17 papers report controlled trials. We then synthesize the results of the existing literature to give insights into what the corpus reveals about how we should teach algorithms. Much of the literature explores implementing well-established practices, such as active learning or automated assessment, in the algorithms classroom. However, there are algorithms-specific results as well: a number of papers find that students may under-utilize certain algorithmic design techniques, and studies describe a variety of ways to select algorithms problems that increase student engagement and learning. The results we present, along with the publicly available set of papers collected, provide a detailed representation of the current corpus of CS Education work related to algorithm design and can orient further research in the area.},

  abstract      = {In the challenging environment of deep-sea oil and gas extraction, the occurrence of hydrate plugging due to gas hydrate formation and deposition in subsea pipelines poses significant operational risks. This issue, leading to pipeline or valve blockages, not only jeopardizes the safe extraction of oil and gas resources but also poses a threat to the marine environment. To address this problem and achieve low-carbon and green flow assurance, the design and development of new, efficient, and environmentally friendly kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) have become essential for the petroleum industry. The review discusses the current research status of KHIs, providing an overview of KHI types and evaluation methods, emphasizing the combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with experimental methods, i.e., the combination of ``virtual and reality''. The inhibition mechanisms of KHIs and their synergistic effects with each other (synergists) are outlined. The direction of the development of KHIs, including greener chemicals, higher adaptability to multiphase transmission environments, and more functions, is proposed. Furthermore, the utilization of the machine-learning technique to accelerate the screening of KHIs is discussed. The aim of this review is to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, offering insights into the mechanism of KHIs and suggesting future directions for the design and screening of KHIs.},

  abstract      = {The Euler–Lagrange method is a great way for multiphase bubble flow simulation, the detailed information of bubbles can be effortlessly obtained, and it is helpful for the efficiency and safety of different industry processes. Traditionally, the computational fluid dynamics-discrete bubble model (CFD-DBM) method has always been used to simulate this flow process. Nevertheless, the ability of the traditional CFD-DBM method is significantly limited in terms of the size ratio between the grid and bubble, where the grid size must be larger than the bubble size. In reality, the bubble may be larger than the grid and the grid/bubble size ratio can be very large due to the effects of complex bubble dynamics (such as the bubble breakup and coalescence) and complex internal flows. To address this issue, an improved CFD-DBM method is proposed in this study, which can be used for the simulation with a wide grid/bubble size ratio in gas–liquid–bubble multiphase simulation, and the volume of fluid (VOF) method is applied to capture the interface between gas and liquid phases. A gradient-based interpolation method is employed to reconstruct the liquid velocity around the target bubble when the grid size is much larger than the bubble size. If the bubble size is comparable with or larger than the grid size, the interphase force correction and the field smoothing will be carried out within a spherical support area. Subsequently, the proposed model is validated by the comparison with a bubble column experiment, in terms of the bubble size distribution and bubble vertical velocity. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the new method. Finally, the influence of different parameters including normal spring stiffness, critical Weber number, and the range of the spherical support area on the bubble flow is investigated.}

  abstract      = {Water pollution caused by an abusive discharge of dye-containing wastewater leads to serious ecological risks. Conventional wastewater treatment methods have shortcomings of incomplete degradation, long-time treatment and secondary pollution. For the first time, a rotational hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (RHCR) equipped with a conical rotor has been designed to enhance the ozonation process for effective degradation of pollutants. The effects of rotational speed, discharge voltage, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate and initial pH on methylene blue (MB) degradation were deeply investigated. The optimised conditions were initial pH = 9, rotational speed = 1800 rpm, discharge voltage = 9.3 kV, gas flow rate = 60 mL/min and liquid flow rate = 80 mL/min. With the integration of ozonation and cavitation in RHCR, the MB degradation efficiency reached 95.2\%, which was 15.6\% higher than that of the individual ozonation method. The degradation process was proven to track the first-order kinetic model, with the reaction rate and synergy index were 0.232 min-1 and 1.78, respectively. Through the quenching experiments, it can be confirmed that the contribution proportion of hydroxyl radical during degradation was increased by 8.7\% due to the enhancement of cavitation. A required energy consumption of 74.7 kWh/order/m3 and a total expense of 8.7 \$/m3 were calculated. The energy consumption of the RHCR was approximately 80\% lower than that of the recently reported degradation system combining ozonation and cavitation, with total expense reduced by 52\%. The findings of this work provide a new water treatment method and offered theoretical references for the design of RHCR.},

  abstract      = {Coal is by far the largest fossil fuel resource in the U.S. with known reserves adequate to meet expected demand without major increases in production cost well beyond the year 2010. In contrast, domestic natural gas, its principal fossil fuel competitor for power generation, is a more limited resource and increases in production cost and decreased availability are projected to occur after the year 2000, thus weakening its ability to compete with coal for power generation in the U.S. Renewable and nuclear energy sources are not expected to displace coal to a major extent during the 1995–2040 time period considered here. For manufacture of liquid and gaseous fuels, coal is projected to become competitive with other resources (petroleum, oil shale and bitumen) in the 2021–2040 time period. Increasingly strict requirements for environmental management of coal-generated waste streams are also anticipated with a growing incentive to reduce CO2 production through increased efficiency. This planning model imposes demanding requirements for conversion of coal to electricity and to clean gaseous and liquid fuels and, thus, for a strategic program of research, development and commercialization to most efficiently utilize coal resources in the 21st century. This review is based on an assessment of DOE's coal research, development, demonstration and commercialization programs for the time period 1995–2040. This assessment was conducted under the auspices of the National Research Council, in response to a request from the Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. For the above time period, electric power generation is expected to dominate the use of coal, although a growing production of merchant medium Btu gas and liquid transportation fuels is anticipated during the period 2021–2040. The current DOE coal program emphasizes activities through 2010 and is focused almost exclusively on power generation technologies with small programs on other uses. Funding for many of the latter programs has been reduced significantly in recent years. The present study, with its longer time horizon, proposes an increasing emphasis on clean fuels research and on advanced research that addresses the barriers to higher efficiency in both power generation and fuels production to reduce CO2 emissions. Improvements will also be needed in control of air pollutants and the discharge of solid wastes. The power generation program addresses both near term goals that do not offer significantly higher efficiency, and also more ambitious goals based on combined cycles utilizing high performance gas turbines or fuel cells to potentially provide a 10–15 point increase in efficiency. These increases in efficiency will require extensive R\&D to overcome technological barriers. For fuel cells, high cost appears to be the major problem. For the gas turbine systems, production of a hot gas stream of sufficient purity to allow use of the very high efficiency gas turbines being developed for use with natural gas presents the major challenge. Critical components include: high temperature filters for PFBC systems; high temperature air/furnace heat exchanger for indirect fixed systems; hot gas cleanup system for PFBC and for gasification-based systems; high temperature turbine blades compatible with trace impurities that may escape the high temperature gas cleanup system; and high thermal efficiency gasification. Solution of these challenging problems will require a continued program of advanced research and component development. The choice of winners from the large array of technologies will also require augmented use of systems studies and development of realistic commercialization strategies. As natural gas prices rise, production of cleaned coal-based medium Btu gas for use in existing natural gas fueled-combined cycles and for industrial heat becomes economic and could relieve the pressure on the supply of natural gas for other uses. Conversion of this coal-based medium Btu gas to methane (SNG) might follow towards the end of the 2021–2040 time period. For this use, high efficiency oxygen blown-cold gas clean up gasification is needed. At present, however, the DOE gasification program is concentrated on air blown processes specifically aimed at integration with power generation. Production of medium Btu (synthesis gas) will allow concurrent production of hydrogen or Fischer-Tropsch liquids. The use of simplified once through processes with production of electric power from unconverted feed and low value products (such as methane) could bring costs of premium liquid fuels to a level competitive with 25–30 \$/bbl imported crude oil (DOE financing basis). Current projections indicated that the price of imported crude oil could be in this range in the 2021–2050 time frame. Direct liquefaction costs, with continued R\&D, are believed to be approximately the same as indirect liquefaction, but with 5–10\% higher efficiency and correspondingly less production of CO2. Given the long-term nature of opportunities for production of coal-derived gaseous and liquid fuels, DOE has a special role to play in supporting technology development aimed at cost reduction and efficiency improvement for these potentially important uses of coal.},

The surrounding fluid is assumed to behave in a continuum and the dispersed-fluid is assumed to be dilute such that particle–particle interactions and two-way coupling effects can be ignored. The key process considered herein is momentum transfer to the particles with emphasis on turbulent diffusion. Computational approaches are classified by their particular treatment of the continuous-phase (surrounding liquid or gas) and of the dispersedphase (solid particles, droplets, or bubbles). The most appropriate point-volume descriptions for interphase transfer of momentum are described based on current research and experimental data. Modern Lagrangian and Eulerian treatments of the dispersed-phase motion are then considered for predicting a variety of particle–fluid physical phenomenon. Finally, the ``tools'' (computational techniques) are summarized based on the ``job'' (prediction of a particular set of dispersed-phase properties) and the ``cost'' (required computational resources). ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract      = {The drag of a non-spherical particle was reviewed and investigated for a variety of shapes (regular and irregular) and particle Reynolds numbers (Rep). Point-force models for the trajectory-averaged drag were discussed for both the Stokes regime (Rep \ll{} 1) and Newton regime (Rep \gg{} 1 and sub-critical with approximately constant drag coefficient) for a particular particle shape. While exact solutions were often available for the Stokes regime, the Newton regime depended on: aspect ratio for spheroidal particles, surface area ratio for other regularly-shaped particles, and min–med–max area for irregularly shaped particles. The combination of the Stokes and Newton regimes were well integrated using a general method by Ganser (developed for isometric shapes and disks). In particular, a modified Clift–Gauvin expression was developed for particles with approximately cylindrical cross-sections relative to the flow, e.g. rods, prolate spheroids, and oblate spheroids with near-unity aspect ratios. However, particles with non-circular cross-sections exhibited a weaker dependence on Reynolds number, which is attributed to the more rapid transition to flow separation and turbulent boundary layer conditions. Their drag coefficient behavior was better represented by a modified Dallavalle drag model, by again integrating the Stokes and Newton regimes. This paper first discusses spherical particle drag and classification of particle shapes, followed by the main body which discusses drag in Stokes and Newton regimes and then combines these results for the intermediate regimes.},

Further utilization of solid carbon accruing during the process (i. e., in battery industry or for metallurgy) increases the process's economic chances. This study demonstrated the feasibility of gas-phase methane pyrolysis for hydrogen production and carbon capture in an electrically heated high-temperature reactor operated between 1200 and 1600 \textdegree{}C under industrially relevant conditions. While hydrogen addition controlled methane conversion and suppressed the formation of undesired byproducts, an increasing residence time decreased the amount of byproducts and benefited high hydrogen yields. A temperature of 1400 \textdegree{}C ensured almost full methane conversion, moderate byproduct formation, and high hydrogen yield. A reaction flow analysis of the gas-phase kinetics revealed acetylene, ethylene, and benzene as the main intermediate products and precursors of carbon formation.},

High-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) was used for isolation and purification of punicalagin from pomegranate husk. Using preparative HSCCC about a 350 mg amount of the crude extract was separated, yielding 105 mg of punicalagin at a high-purity of over 92\%.

  abstract      = {Cluster in CFB riser significantly affects performance of circulating fluidized beds. To model hydrodynamic behavior in CFB risers, three phase flows were assumed in the riser, the gas phase, the dispersed particle phase, and the clusters phase. The gas–solid multi-fluid model is extended to give the macroscopic averaged equations with constitutive equations for both particle phases from kinetic theory of granular flow. The clusters and the dispersed particles have their own fluctuating energy or two individual granular temperatures. Interactions between the cluster and its surrounding dispersed particles were obtained from kinetic theory of granular flow. Drag force for gas to dispersed particles and the clusters are empirically determined. The momentum exchange between dispersed particles and clusters is modeled using the concept of molecular dynamics. Cluster properties are predicted with the cluster-based approach. The distributions of volume fractions and velocities of gas, dispersed particles and clusters are predicted. Computed solid mass fluxes and volume fractions agree with Manyele et al. [S.V.

  abstract      = {To achieve high energy density and superior rate capacity of carbon-based supercapacitors, the integration of large specific area, hierarchical porous structure and abundant heteroatom doping is considered to be a powerful engineered strategy. Unfortunately, such porous carbon materials with multiple synergistic effects are difficult to be achieved simultaneously by conventional synthesis methods in few steps. Herein, we report a series of micro-dominant hierarchical porous carbon with rich heteroatom doping amounts derived by hypercrosslinked polymerization approach for high-performance supercapacitors. Among them, the N/S co-doped porous carbon (N, S-MC) exhibits a micro-dominant (77.5\%) hierarchical porous structure, a large surface area (1339\,m2\,g-1), and rich heteroatom doping amount (4.5\% for N, 5.8\% for S). Remarkably, the N, S-MC (symmetric capacitors in two-electrode system) delivers a specific capacitance as high as 464\,F\,g-1 at 0.2\,A\,g-1, hence a high energy density of 16.2\,W\,h\,kg-1 at 50\,W\,kg-1. Meanwhile, the capacitance retention of N, S-MC remains over 92\% after 10,000 cycles. This work reports a hypercrosslinked polymerization approach to construct hierarchical porous N, S co-doped carbon for high-performance supercapacitor device, which is look forward to provide a new strategy to prepare carbon-based materials for ultrafast electron/ion transport supercapacitors.},

Typically, task-specific machine learning models for distinct reaction prediction tasks have been developed. In this work, we develop a unified deep learning model, T5Chem, for a variety of chemical reaction predictions tasks by adapting the ``Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer'' (T5) framework in natural language processing (NLP). On the basis of self-supervised pretraining with PubChem molecules, the T5Chem model can achieve state-of-the-art performances for four distinct types of task-specific reaction prediction tasks using four different open-source data sets, including reaction type classification on USPTO\_TPL, forward reaction prediction on USPTO\_MIT, single-step retrosynthesis on USPTO\_50k, and reaction yield prediction on high-throughput C–N coupling reactions. Meanwhile, we introduced a new unified multitask reaction prediction data set USPTO\_500\_MT, which can be used to train and test five different types of reaction tasks, including the above four as well as a new reagent suggestion task. Our results showed that models trained with multiple tasks are more robust and can benefit from mutual learning on related tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain T5Chem predictions at the functional group level, which provides a way to demystify sequence-based deep learning models in chemistry.

Green hydrogen has been communicated as the desired solution, however, the high production cost limits the deployment of these systems. The thermo-catalytic methane decomposition (TCMD) process is an alternative solution, which could be implemented as a bridge technology to produce low-emission hydrogen at a potentially lower cost. This is especially attractive for iron ore mines due to the utilisation of iron ore as a process catalyst, which reduces the catalyst turnover costs and can increase the grade of spent iron ore catalyst. In this study, a preliminary techno-economic assessment was carried out in comparison with green hydrogen to determine the feasibility of the TCMD process for the decarbonisation of iron ore mine sites in the Pilbara. The results show that the TCMD process had a CO2 abatement cost between 25 and 40\% less than green hydrogen, however, the magnitude of these costs was lowest for mining operations {$>$}60~Mt/yr at approximately \$150 and \$200 USD/t CO2 respectively. Since green hydrogen is expected to have significant cost reductions in the future, integrating renewables already into the mine could reduce emissions in the short term, which could then be extended for green hydrogen production once it becomes viable. The TCMD process, therefore, only has a narrow window of opportunity, although considering the uncertainty of the process and that green hydrogen is a proven technology with greater emission-reduction potential, green hydrogen may be the most suitable solution despite the model results presented in this work.},

This field does not appear to have a pyramidal structure, like the best of physics. We have very few great hypotheses. Most of our experiments are exploratory experiments. What does this mean? We believe it means that, even after 100 years, turbulence studies are still in their infancy. We are naturalists, observing butterflies in the wild. We are still discovering how turbulence behaves, in many respects. We do have a crude, practical, working understanding of many turbulence phenomena but certainly nothing approaching a comprehensive theory, and nothing that will provide predictions of an accuracy demanded by designers.},

The gas-phase field was solved by using large eddy simulation method, and the particle trajectories were traced in Lagrangian framework based on one-way coupling. The coherent structures and particle dispersion were simulated and compared with previous experiment results. The typical coherent structures alternately forming from the near-wall region, shedding and moving towards the downstream positions were observed. Due to the effects of the coherent structures, the particles demonstrate a more organized dispersion process in the space and a periodic dispersion characteristic in the time. However, for particles at different Stokes numbers, the dispersion patterns are different. Although the particles at smaller Stokes number congregate mainly in the vortex core regions and the particles at larger Stokes number assemble in the vortex braid regions, the particles at intermediate Stokes numbers concentrate highly in the boundary regions of the coherent structures. The two-phase flow characteristics obtained by the present large eddy simulation are in quantitative agreement with previous experiment results.},

However, after removal of CO2, biogas can be upgraded to natural gas quality, giving more utilization possibilities, such as utilization as autogas, or distant utilization by using the existing natural gas grid. The current study presents a new biological method for biogas upgrading in a separate biogas reactor, containing enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogens and fed with biogas and hydrogen. Both mesophilic- and thermophilic anaerobic cultures were enriched to convert CO2 to CH4 by addition of H2. Enrichment at thermophilic temperature (55\textdegree{}C) resulted in CO2 and H2 bioconversion rate of 320 mL CH4/(gVSS h), which was more than 60\% higher than that under mesophilic temperature (37\textdegree{}C). Different dominant species were found at mesophilic- and thermophilic-enriched cultures, as revealed by PCR–DGGE. Nonetheless, they all belonged to the order Methanobacteriales, which can mediate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Biogas upgrading was then tested in a thermophilic anaerobic reactor under various operation conditions. By continuous addition of hydrogen in the biogas reactor, high degree of biogas upgrading was achieved. The produced biogas had a CH4 content, around 95\% at steady-state, at gas (mixture of biogas and hydrogen) injection rate of 6 L/(L day). The increase of gas injection rate to 12 L/(L day) resulted in the decrease of CH4 content to around 90\%. Further study showed that by decreasing the gas–liquid mass transfer by increasing the stirring speed of the mixture the CH4 content was increased to around 95\%. Finally, the CH4 content around 90\% was achieved in this study with the gas injection rate as high as 24 L/(L day). Biotechnol.

Data-driven deep learning methods produce operators that can learn solutions to the whole system of partial differential equations. However, the existing methods are only evaluated on simple flow equations (e.g., Burger's equation), and only consider the generalization ability on different initial conditions. In this paper, we construct CFDBench, a benchmark with four classic problems in computational fluid dynamics (CFD): lid-driven cavity flow, laminar boundary layer flow in circular tubes, dam flows through the steps, and periodic Karman vortex street. Each flow problem includes data with different boundary conditions, fluid physical properties, and domain geometry. Compared to existing datasets, the advantages of CFDBench are (1) comprehensive. It contains common physical parameters such as velocity, pressure, and cavity fraction. (2) realistic. It is very suitable for deep learning solutions of fluid mechanics equations. (3) challenging. It has a certain learning difficulty, prompting to find models with strong learning ability. (4) standardized. CFDBench facilitates a comprehensive and fair comparison of different deep learning methods for CFD. We make appropriate modifications to popular deep neural networks to apply them to CFDBench and enable the accommodation of more changing inputs. The evaluation on CFDBench reveals some new shortcomings of existing works and we propose possible directions for solving such problems.},

  abstract      = {Biogas upgrading uniquely requires pressurisation of hollow fibre membrane contactors (HFMC) to be competitive with classical water absorption, and when complemented with an ambient industrial temperature range, these conditions will determine CO2 mass transport phenomena that are distinct dependent upon whether microporous or nonporous membranes are used. This study therefore examines the independent and concomitant role of temperature and pressure in determining CO2 mass transport, and selectivity, within microporous and nonporous HFMC. At low solvent temperatures, higher CO2 flux was achieved which indicates that solvent solubility is more critical than CO2 diffusivity to enhancing mass transport. Low temperatures also favoured mass transfer within the microporous membrane, explained by the reduction in solvent vapour pressure which limited pore wetting by condensation. In contrast, the nonporous membrane exhibited poorer mass transfer at low temperatures due to a decline in dense polymer permeability. Crucially in this study, neither wetting of the microporous membrane or plasticisation of the nonporous membrane were observed following pressurisation. Consequently, CO2 flux increased in proportion to the applied pressure for both membrane types, emphasising the critical role of pressurisation in augmenting process intensification for biogas upgrading which is typically facilitated at pressures of 7–10~bar. Resistance-in-series analysis illustrated how pressurisation reduced gas-phase resistance, and subsequently enhanced selectivity. Consequently, an outlet gas quality of 98\% methane could be achieved within a single microporous module at 4.5~bar, meeting the industrial standard for biomethane whilst reducing solvent requirements, separation energy and methane losses. Comparable behaviour was observed during pressurisation of the nonporous membrane, but with a less significant benefit to CO2 mass transfer and selectivity, ostensibly due to the resistance imparted by the dense polymer. When considered collectively, low solvent temperature and high gas pressure enhance process intensification subsequently reducing process size (e.g., membrane area) and separation energy, while also advancing selectivity to deliver a gas product at the composition required for biomethane with minimum methane losses, which are critical factors in demonstrating microporous HFMC as an industrially competitive solution for biogas upgrading.},

The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

  abstract      = {For combustion with CO2 capture, chemical-looping combustion has the advantage that no energy is lost for the separation of CO2. In chemical-looping combustion oxygen is transferred from the combustion air to the gaseous fuel by means of an oxygen carrier. The fuel and the combustion air are never mixed, and the gases from the oxidation of the fuel, CO2 and H2O, leave the system as a separate stream. The H2O can easily be removed by condensation and pure CO2 is obtained without any loss of energy for separation. This makes chemical-looping combustion a most interesting alternative to other CO2 separation schemes, which have the drawback of a large energy consumption. A design of a boiler with chemical-looping combustion is proposed. The system involves two interconnected uidized beds, a high-velocity riser and a low-velocity bed. Metal oxide particles are used as oxygen carrier. The reactivities needed for oxygen carriers to be suitable for such a process are estimated and compared to available experimental data for particles of Fe2O3 and NiO. The data available on oxygen carriers, although limited, indicate that the process outlined should be feasible. ? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {An electrified reactor driven by renewable electricity, substituting conventionally fired reactors, will reduce CO2 and provide a compact manner for hydrogen generation. Herein, we proposed a high-efficiency electrified reactor based on a high-temperature heat pipe (HTPR). The start-up of the HTPR powered by electricity was firstly evaluated, showing a start-up duration of 250~s and maintaining significant temperature uniformity of 96.7\%. Then, the feasibility and performance of the HTPR were validated by experiments. The methane conversion and hydrogen mole fraction were 80.0\% and 70.5\% at a steam to carbon ratio of three, respectively. Finally, the reaction performance under different operating conditions was simulated. The methane conversion and the hydrogen mole fraction were attenuated with the increase in flow rate, and improving catalyst porosity is beneficial for the heat transfer between catalysts and gases. This study serves as a framework for designing an electrified reactor for endothermic reactions.},

Despite several promising applications of FOs, the influence of their design and scale on the resulting jet oscillations and mixing has not been systematically studied. In this work, we investigated the influence of geometric configuration and device scale on jet oscillation frequency, flow, mixing, and residence time distribution (RTD). Initially, flow in FO was simulated using a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for exploring a wider parameter space. These simulations indicated that the distance of the backflow limb from the inlet and device scale are the most important design parameters influencing the jet oscillation frequency. Detailed three-dimensional CFD simulations were then carried out for the shortlisted configurations of the FO. The shortlisted configurations were fabricated, and experimental measurements of jet oscillations were carried out. The jet oscillation frequency was measured using acquired pressure fluctuation data and fast Fourier transforms. The simulated results were compared with the experimental data. The validated CFD model was then used to evaluate various flow features of FO, mixing, and liquid and solid RTD considering potential applications. The presented results will be useful for identifying suitable design and operating parameters of the FO for a variety of processes and applications.},

However, the simulation of plasma pyrolysis reactors is extremely complex due to the vast temporal and spatial ranges of the variables involved and steep gradients. Previously, methane pyrolysis has been meticulously modeled by 0D simulations, and 3D plasma modeling has been largely confined to Argon systems. In this paper, a systematic methodology is presented, which provides an expedient and efficient hierarchy of 0D to 3D simulations, in order to approximate the methane pyrolysis simulation of a plasma reactor in its entirety. Various simulation tools are applied in a coordinated and pragmatic manner. The results show that the proposed synergy allows simplification of the reaction set and arc characteristics, significantly reducing the runtime required for the simulations.},

  abstract      = {A fluidized-bed reactor model is implemented to simulate a Maleic Anhydride (MA) reactor with special emphasis on its dynamic behaviour. The dynamic model is general enough that it can treat a wide range of catalytic systems, subject to mass and energy balances within the phases. The model represents multiple phases and regions (low-density phase, high-density phase, freeboard region) and can account for heat and mass axial and radial anisotropic dispersion, change in molar/volumetric flow due to reaction, temperature and pressure profiles, hydrodynamic regime variation, catalyst deactivation, energy options, and multiple membranes of various geometries for introduction/extraction of any compound. The model reduces, as special cases, to most fluidized bed reactor models reported in the literature, allowing the influence of simplifying assumptions to be investigated. Introduction of different assumptions for a MA fluidized-bed reactor of industrial scale reveal quite different predicted time scales for key dynamic phenomena inherent to the process. A mass transfer/reaction time scale was found to be close to the residence time of the gas molecules in the reactor. The heat transfer time scale is several orders of magnitude larger for the current system. This type of time-scale analysis may be a useful tool to identify the appropriate degree of sophistication to predict the dynamics of complex reacting systems.},

  abstract      = {Sulforaphane (SFN) is an isothiocyanate occurring in broccoli, with exceptional health-beneficial properties, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertensive effects. Processes to maximize SFN content in broccoli developed until now are expensive and SFN bioavailability in the vegetable is not optimal. To increase SFN extraction yield from broccoli florets, it was proposed to complement traditional solvent extraction with pulsed electric field (PEF) as tissue disruption method enabling the reduction of mass transfer resistance in vegetable matrices. Tissue disruption methods enhance the performance of this process because it reduces mass transfer resistance. PEF is an innovative technology recently introduced in the food industry. We studied the effect of electric field strength (10 and 15 kV/cm) and time of exposure to the PEF treatment (30, 90, and 150 s) on the recovery of SFN from broccoli florets, using a statistical factorial design. Electric field strength and exposure time significantly affected SFN recovery in a positive way. PEFs increase SFN recovery by more than 50\% compared to traditional extraction. This result was achieved at 150 s exposure to PEF and 10 kV/cm. Practical Applications The use of pulsed electric fields significantly improved sulforaphane recovery from broccoli in comparison with traditional extraction methods. Even though in this work the raw material was commercial broccoli heads, it is most likely that the results obtained here can be replicated using low-value raw material, such as broccoli heads that do not meet commercial standards or crop discards. Accordingly, PEF technology constitutes an option for valorization of Brassicaceae agroindustry discards.},

  abstract      = {Generating hydrodynamic/ acoustic cavitation (Gogate et al.) for a useful purpose encompasses the following energy transformation steps: (1) Burning fuel in boiler. (2) Expanding the steam in a turbine generator. (3) Using electrical output from the generator to: (a) Pump water through a mechanical constriction (hydrodynamic cavitation), or (b) Operate ultrasonic transducer (acoustic cavitation). The combined loss, which is the mathematical product of each of the above step efficiencies, lowers the overall efficiency. An energy efficient method for generating useful cavitation is presented here. It suggests direct injection of steam (I) into sub-cooled water to produce cavitation, thereby eliminating the inefficiencies of the remaining steps (II and III). Cavitation produced by this technique was experimentally and numerically shown to produce collapse conditions similar to hydrodynamic/acoustic cavitation. Direct steam injection cavitation coupled with acoustic cavitation, exhibited 4–16 times greater energy efficiency as compared to acoustic cavitation alone. Similar effects have been numerically speculated for hydrodynamic cavitation. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 54, 2008},

  abstract      = {Here, an experimental investigation on the e"ective drag force in a conventional \#uidized bed is presented. Two beds of di"erent particle size distribution belonging to group B and group B/D powders were \#uidized in air in a 13:8 cm diameter column. The drag force on a particle has been calculated based on the measurement ofparticle velocity and concentration during pulse gas tests, using twin-plane electrical capacitance tomography. The validity of the voidage function ``correction function'', (1 -  s)n, for the reliable estimation of the e"ective drag force has been investigated. The parameter n shows substantial dependence on the relative particle Reynolds number (Rep{\_\ast}), and the spatial variation of the e"ective static and hydrodynamic forces. It is also illustrated that, a simple correlation for the e"ective drag coe;cient as function of the particle Reynolds number (Rep), expressed implicitly in terms ofthe interstitial gas velocity, can serve in estimating the e"ective drag force in a real \#uidization process. Analysis shows that, the calculated drag force is comparable to the particle weight, which enables a better understanding ofthe particle dynamics, and the degree ofspatial segregation in a multi-sized particle bed mixture. The analogy presented in this paper could be extended to obtain a generalized correlation for the e"ective drag coe;cient in a \#uidized bed in terms of Rep and the particle physical properties. ? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A comparative analysis of the hydrodynamic features (solid distribution, bubble shape and bed expansion) extracted from the ECT measurement and the prediction of the MFIX simulation code is presented. For a fluidised bed of group B particles, the code does not provide an accurate prediction of bubble shape and bed expansion at the intermediate to high gas velocity range. For cohesive particles such as group A/B, the code shows considerable overexpansion. This deficiency was mainly attributed to the fact that the MFIX code does not take into account the realistic existence of interparticle cohesion or frictional forces at the intermediate-dense flow regime. Accordingly, proposed interparticle cohesion and frictional shear stress terms have been incorporated, and tested in a two-fluid kinetic theory model to investigate their effect on the general hydrodynamic features of fully developed vertical duct flow. The results show that incorporating both terms in the classic kinetic theory model results in an improvement of the gas–solid distribution and a lowering of the solid carryover, which implies a reduced bed expansion in the freely bubbling column.},

For this, microfluidic and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) tube HC reactors with different configurations were employed, and the results from the reactors were compared with a magnetic stirrer, as well as a tergotometer. According to our results PEEK tube HC reactors present the best performance for dissolution of liquid and powder detergents. In the case of liquid detergent, for the same level of initial concentration and comparable final dissolution, the PEEK tube consumed 16.7 and 70\% of the energy and time of a tergotometer and 16.7 and 14.8\% of that of a magnetic stirrer, respectively. In the case of powder detergent, the PEEK tube used 12\% less power than a tergotometer and 81.2\% less power than a magnetic stirrer. Additionally, the time required to dissolve the detergent was reduced significantly from 1200 s in the tergotometer and 1800 s in the magnetic stirrer to just 50 s in the PEEK tube. These results suggest that HC could significantly improve the dissolution rate of liquid and powder detergents and energy consumption in washing machines.},

This fibre is a complex mixture of non-starch polysaccharides making up the thickened cell walls of the kernel. The fibre has properties of both insoluble and soluble fibres. It is a major by-product of the manufacture of lupin protein isolates, which can be dried to produce a purified fibre food ingredient. Such an ingredient possesses a neutral odour and flavour, a smooth texture, and high water-binding and oil-binding properties. These properties allow its incorporation into foods with minimum reduction in their acceptability. The lupin kernel fibre (LKF) has demonstrated beneficial effects in clinical studies on biomarkers for metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It can be described as a ``prebiotic fibre'' since it improves gut micro-floral balance and the chemical environment within the colon. Thus, LKF is a health-functional ingredient with great opportunity for more widespread use in foods; however, it is evident that more non-thermal methods for the manufacture of lupin kernel fibre should be explored, including their effects on the physicochemical properties of the fibre and the effect on health outcomes in long term clinical trials.},

It was simulated the conversion obtained in a fixed-bed reactor (PBR) packed with a Cu-based catalyst making use of a composed kinetic equation in which the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate model was used for the lowest temperature range (up to 215 \textordmasculine{}C), while for temperatures in the range 215 – 300 \textordmasculine{}C a redox model was employed. Several packed-bed reactor models were then proposed, all of them without any fitting parameters. After comparing the simulations against experimental CO conversion data for different temperatures and space time values, it was concluded that the heterogeneous model comprising axial dispersion and mass transfer resistances shows the best fitting. This model revealed also good adherence to other experiments employing different feed compositions (CO and H2O contents); it predicts also the overall trend of increasing CO conversion with the total pressure. This modeling work is particularly important for small scale applications related with hydrogen production/purification for fuel cells.},

Aggregate properties (frequency, time fraction, existence time, average solids concentration and cluster vertical dimension) were established using transient solids concentration data, based on the results of the sensitivity analysis. These parameters revealed a strong dependence of the aggregate properties on operating conditions, local mean solids concentration, radial position and axial elevation.},

The fundamentals and challenges of multiphase flow thermal-hydraulic simulations are covered in depth jointly with the prediction of hydrocarbon properties. Historic multiphase flow models are reviewed, and the newer two-fluid model is developed for practical applications. Examples of the steady-state models presented include well flow, gathering systems, pipe fittings and restrictions. Practical examples of transient multiphase flow in wells and pipelines highlight the operational challenges of hydrocarbon production and complement the normal steady-state performance. The book also includes brief sections on important topics such as multiphase flow metering and sand fines transport. In summary, this book aims to put together the tools for pragmatic simulation of multiphase transport in the oil and gas industry."-- Provided by publisher},

In order to analyze CFBA systems in detail, a gas mixture/solids mixture model based on the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations is developed for particle flow, agglomeration, physical and chemical adsorption in a circulating fluidized bed. The solids mixture consists of two solids, one with components of CaO and CaSO4, and the other being an activated carbon. The gas mixture is composed of fine particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide, mercury vapor, oxygen and inert gas. Source terms representing fine particulate matter agglomeration onto sorbent particles, sulfur dioxide removal through chemical adsorption onto calcined lime, and mercury vapor removal through physical adsorption onto activated carbon are formulated and included into the model. The governing equations are solved using high-resolution upwind-differencing methods, combined with a time-derivative preconditioning method for efficient time-integration. Numerical simulations of bench-scale operation of a prototype CFBA reactor for multi-pollutant control are described.},

  abstract      = {A literature survey shows that there are two approaches to mathematically describe gas–solid two-phase flow and reaction in the fluidized bed reactors. One approach is a very simplistic engineering reactor model, and the other approach is based on a rigorous Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model. Despite significant progress on numerical methods, CPU capacity and performance, and theories describing gas–solid flow, CFD based reacting flow modeling is far from being a routine tool for designing new reactors. Thus, simpler reactor models are still the main method for providing guidance for fluidized bed reactor design and optimization. However, traditional reactor models have considered too many simplifying assumptions that create inconsistencies in the governing equations of the boundary conditions such that it can result in erroneous prediction. In the current paper, an advanced gas–solid two-phase engineering reactor model has been developed for flow, heat transfer and reaction in the riser reactor of a circulating fluidized bed system. In contrast to CFD, this model can use as input parameters the hydrodynamic information obtained from published literature or experimental measurement such as axial and radial profiles for solid volume fraction, gas velocity and gas dispersion coefficient. While the hydrodynamics can be as accurate as measured, this advanced engineering reactor model is also coupled with either simple power law or the most rigorous kinetic models that involve elementary reactions. In this way, we can extract heterogeneous reaction kinetics from pilot plant or production reactor data directly. Model validation with pilot plant data and tracer data for a riser reactor will be presented and the short falls of traditional treatment of engineering fluidized bed reactor models will also be discussed.},

  abstract      = {Recent developments in deep learning have brought many inspirations for the scientific computing community and it is perceived as a promising method in accelerating the computationally demanding reacting flow simulations. In this work, we introduce DeepFlame, an open-source C++ platform with the capabilities of utilising machine learning algorithms and offline-trained models to solve for reactive flows. We combine the individual strengths of the computational fluid dynamics library OpenFOAM, machine learning framework Torch, and chemical kinetics program Cantera. The complexity of cross-library function and data interfacing (the core of DeepFlame) is minimised to achieve a simple and clear workflow for code maintenance, extension and upgrading. As a demonstration, we apply our recent work on deep learning for predicting chemical kinetics (Zhang et al., 2022 [8]) to highlight the potential of machine learning in accelerating reacting flow simulation. A thorough code validation is conducted via a broad range of canonical cases to assess its accuracy and efficiency. The results demonstrate that the convection-diffusion-reaction algorithms implemented in DeepFlame are robust and accurate for both steady-state and transient processes. In addition, a number of methods aiming to further improve the computational efficiency, e.g. dynamic load balancing and adaptive mesh refinement, are explored. Their performances are also evaluated and reported. With the deep learning method implemented in this work, a speed-up of two orders of magnitude is achieved in a simple hydrogen ignition case when performed on a medium-end graphics processing unit (GPU). Further gain in computational efficiency is expected for hydrocarbon and other complex fuels. A similar level of acceleration is obtained on an AI-specific chip – deep computing unit (DCU), highlighting the potential of DeepFlame in leveraging the next-generation computing architecture and hardware.

Solution method: An open-source platform bringing together the individual strengths of OpenFOAM, Cantera and PyTorch libraries is built in this study. In the present implementation, CVODE solvers, detailed transport models and deep learning algorithms are all adopted to assist the simulation of reacting flow. Note that here machine learning is introduced in combination with heterogeneous computing to accelerate the most demanding solving procedure for chemical source term evaluation.},

The idea of the method is to augment a finite element simulation on coarse grids with fine scale information obtained using deep neural networks. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements. The local approach proves to be highly efficient, since the network can be kept (relatively) small and since it can be applied in parallel on all grid patches. However, the main advantage of the local approach is the inherent generalizability of the method. Since the network only processes data of small sub-areas, it never ``sees'' the global problem and thus does not learn false biases. We describe the method with a focus on the interplay between the finite element method and deep neural networks. Further, we demonstrate with numerical examples the excellent efficiency of the hybrid approach, which allows us to achieve very high accuracy with a coarse grid and thus reduce the computation time by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract      = {The recent development towards a battery-powered electric vehicle industry has led to a significant rise in the demand for high-grade Lithium (Li). Global Li is predominately produced from brines (salar or geothermal) and from hard-rocks, while the amount of Li produced from recycling (e.g. from waste batteries) is still negligible, although it is expected to increase in the near future. Li extraction from hard rocks and brines is also associated with environmental issues, such as (i) consumption of a large quantity of reagents, (ii) high water footprint (especially in the case of brines). Therefore, ensuring a clean, stable and sustainable supply of Li is a key point in the European agenda to reach its ambitious climate targets by 2050. Building on this need, a LiOH production process is under development at KU Leuven (C3 SOLVOLi+ project). This process concentrates technical grade LiCl from the roasting of low-content Li sources. Subsequently, it converts the concentrated technical grade LiCl into aqueous LiOH by mean of a series of processes. The presented environmental analysis, based on a ex-ante Life Cycle Assessment, highlights the potential environmental hotspots that can potentially hinder the breakthrough of the technology, providing useful insights on unit processes requiring optimizations during future upscaling. In particular, at this early stage of development, the optimization and the recycling of the chemicals used in the process seems to be the most efficient strategy to reduce the overall environmental impact of the process. Future studies foresee to enlarge the current analysis to the comparison with other processes for LiOH production. A lower environmental footprint can indeed help to strength the position of the proposed process into the future market for LiOH production.},

In order to avoid technological lock-in, alternatives storage technologies including chemical hydrides, e.g. methanol, ammonia, methane and LOHC, must also be explored. These alternatives offer higher hydrogen densities, safer handling, and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, each hydride has unique chemical and physical properties, requires distinct feedstock and conversion processes, and interacts with the energy system in different ways, all of which influences their suitability for various applications. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of these alternative hydrogen storage technologies, as carried out in this article, is vital to allow for informed investment decisions and pave the way towards a successful and sustainable hydrogen economy.},

Gas radial velocity profiles and dispersions were established by a tracer technique in a cold set-up. The gas axial dispersion was determined in an industrial riser. The local concentrations of the solid phase were measured by a tomographic technique. This has allowed an assessment of the core-annulus structure of the bed and an estimate of the solid radial and axial dispersions. The axial solid concentration profiles were determined in pilot and industrial scale beds. These show an important accumulation upstream of the abrupt exit. The overall conclusion is that the gas flow can be considered to be plug flow with a radial velocity profile and a radial dispersion; the solid flow is slightly more dispersed due to the core-annulus structure and a high radial mixing.},

  abstract      = {A new general method for assessing dispersion within a system is proposed, using trajectory data to define a localised sample of locations, and analysis of the variance in location of that sample after a given period of time. A short-time period allows the dispersion to be related to the local conditions within a system, indicating areas of high and low dispersion. No assumption is made as to the cause of the dispersion. This information, combined with probability data, can give an indication of the effectiveness of the whole system for dispersion. Variation in the time allowed between the initial state and the assessment of the variance shows how material is dispersed within a system over time, allowing phenomena occurring at different scales to be investigated using data obtained in a single experiment. This approach has been applied to data obtained from positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) experiments on several systems, chiefly a small bladed solids mixer. Measurements of dispersion were made as a function of both position and time. In the case of the bladed mixer, it was also found that the region of the machine making the largest contribution to dispersion was the entrance to the freeboard, although dispersion within the bulk region became more important at higher speeds. Mixing times were compared between this mixer, a high shear mixer/granulator, and a fluidised bed, demonstrating that this method can also be used to assess the time taken to mix to a given requirement in a wide range of possible mixer types. An estimate of the dispersion expected at infinite time was made, and seen to agree reasonably well with the observed values.},

A multi-\textasciimacron{}uid Computational Fluid Dynamics model has been developed and veri\textregistered{}ed against the experimental results. The \textasciimacron{}ow model is based on an Eulerian description of the phases where the kinetic theory for granular \textasciimacron{}ow forms the basis for the turbulence modeling in the solid phases. The model is generalized for one gas phase and N number of solid phases to enable a realistic description of the particle size distributions in gas/solid \textasciimacron{}ow systems. Each solid phase is characterized by a diameter, form factor, density and restitution coecient. The computational results agree well with the measurements. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

LDA and PIV are two different techniques, but they are both common methods used to gain a better understanding of gas=particle multiphase flows. A comparison between the two methods has been performed. The main focus of this study was an experimental LDA investigation of ZrO2 particles and glass beads. The particles have approximately the same particle size distribution but different densities. The superficial gas velocity and the particle loading have also been varied in the experiments. The effects of superficial gas velocity, particle loading, and particle density on the particle mean velocities, particle u-rms, particle v-rms, and particle cross-moment were investigated. From the experimental investigation it was found that the axial particle velocities showed a dependence on the particle volume fraction for the ZrO2 particles. It was also observed that the axial fluctuations decreased for both glass and ZrO2 particles when the particle volume fraction increased. The axial fluctuations measured for the glass beads were higher than the fluctuations measured for the ZrO2 particles. The mean axial particle velocity measured by LDA and PIV showed good agreement.},

The particles moving in a pipe are charged by collisions with the pipe wall. The charge transferred from the particles to the wall per unit time is equal to the electric current flowing from the wall to earth, and the current depends on the mass flow rate and the charge-to-mass ratio. Conversely, these values can be calculated from the electric current using a special technique; i.e., two short pipes that are made of different materials are installed in series with electrical isolation. The principle of the calculation is based on the contact charging between different materials and the charge balance in the system; the simultaneous equations can be solved analytically.

  abstract      = {Fluctuating wind and solar energy can be used to produce hydrogen by water electrolysis and subsequently for the synthetic natural gas production via methanation in the power-to-gas process. This paper investigates the unsteady-state operation of the methanation in an adiabatic and cooled fixed-bed reactor, respectively, with product recirculation by simulation of a one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model. The results show that adiabatic fixed-bed reactors with product recirculation can operate in a wide range of partial and excess load. The recirculation of product gas cools the adiabatic fixed-bed reactor effectively and an optimal recycle ratio for the highest methane productivity exists. Cooled reactors are very sensitive to load changes of the volumetric flow rate and thus less flexible. However, the recycle of product gas allows reducing the sensitivity for a more stable operation under fluctuating feed conditions. The start-up time of cooled fixed-bed reactors is considerably lower. In summary, the flexibility of the dynamic methanation is enhanced in a loop-reactor arrangement.},

  abstract      = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a new combustion technology with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO2. The technique involves the use of a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier, which transfers oxygen from the combustion air to the fuel, and hence the direct contact between fuel and combustion air is avoided. Subsequently, the products from combustion, e.g. carbon dioxide and water, will be kept separate from the rest of the flue gases, e.g. nitrogen and any remaining oxygen. Two reactors in the form of interconnected fluidized beds are used in the process: i) a fuel reactor where the metal oxide is reduced by reaction with the fuel, and ii) an air reactor where the reduced metal oxide from the fuel reactor is oxidized with air. The outlet gas from the fuel reactor consists of CO2 and H2O while the outlet gas stream from the air reactor contains only N2 and some unused O2. The net chemical reaction over the two reactors is the same as normal combustion with the same amount of heat released, but with the important difference that carbon dioxide is inherently separated from nitrogen, and no extra energy is needed for this separation. This is in contrast to known techniques for separating carbon dioxide from flue gas, where large amounts of energy and expensive equipment are necessary for carrying out this separation. In this paper the thermodynamic feasibility of using several different metal oxides as oxygen carriers in CLC is discussed. Reactivity data for a few different types of iron oxide particles with methane and air is presented and discussed with respect to use in a CLC system based on interconnected fluidized beds. The rates of reaction obtained for all of the samples are sufficient to be used as oxygen carriers in a CLC system based on interconnected fluidized beds.},

  abstract      = {The feasibility of using NiO as an oxygen carrier during chemical-looping combustion has been investigated. A thermodynamic analysis with CH4 as fuel showed that the yield of CH4 to CO2 and H2O was between 97.7 and 99.8\% in the temperature range 700–1200 8C, with the yield decreasing as the temperature increases. Carbon deposition is not expected as long as sufficient metal oxide is supplied to the fuel reactor. Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, in the fuel gas will be converted partially to SO2 in the gas phase, with the degree of conversion increasing with temperature, but decreasing as a function of pressure. There is the possibility of sulfide formation as Ni3S2 at higher partial pressures of H2SCSO2 in the reactor. The reactivity of freeze granulated particles of NiO with NiAl2O4, MgAl2O4, TiO2 and ZrO2 sintered at different temperatures was investigated in a small fluidized bed reactor by exposing them cyclically to 50\% CH4/50\% H2O and 5\% O2 at 950 8C. During the reducing period, the NiO initially reacted with the CH4 to form CO2 and H2O. However, there were always minor amounts of CO from the outlet of the reactor even at high concentrations of CO2, which was due to the thermodynamic limitations. Here, the ratio CO/(CO2CCOCCH4) was between 1.5 and 2.5\% at 950 8C for the oxygen carriers with alumina based inert. A small amount of CH4 was released from the reactor at high degrees of oxidation of the NiAl2O4 and MgAl2O4-based carriers. As the time under reducing conditions increased, steam reforming of CH4 to CO and H2 became considerable, with Ni catalyzing this reaction. Whereas the ZrO2 particles showed similar behavior as the alumina-based carriers, the TiO2-based particles showed a markedly different reaction behavior, likely due to the complex interaction between NiO and TiO2.},

Some pilot scale technology was discussed; however, large-scale industrialisation is impeded by rapid solid catalyst deactivation, low-priced carbon (by-product) of molten catalysts, harsh conditions for reactor materials, and performance of stable molten catalysts. For catalytic methane cracking in molten catalysts (salt or metal), substantial advances in catalyst development, product separation, and reactor design are still required to commercialise methane pyrolysis for hydrogen production. To provide guidance to future works in this area, the review is specifically focused on (i) design of catalysts (ii) recent developments of molten salt-based methane cracking, (iii) reactor design and process design.},

As the demands of these industries for greater efficiency increases and to comply with environmental regulations there is a need for a more fundamental understanding of the behavior of materials in pneumatic conveying systems. The approach presented in this article is to develop a model of a section of pneumatic conveying line, a horizontal or vertical 90  bend, in the commercial CFD software package FLUENT and to describe the multiphase flow behavior by the mixture or Eulerian method. Models of this type have been used in the past to show qualitative and quantitative agreement between model and experiment. The model results presented were compared with experimental data gathered from an industrial-scale pneumatic conveying test system. Broad qualitative agreement in trends and flow patterns were found. Quantitative comparisons were less uniform, with predictions from around 10\% to 90\% different from experimental results, depending on conveying conditions and bend orientation.},

The key objective of machine-learning-based PDE solvers is to output a sufficiently accurate solution faster than standard numerical methods, which are used as a baseline comparison. We first perform a systematic review of the ML-for-PDE-solving literature. Out of all of the articles that report using ML to solve a fluid-related PDE and claim to outperform a standard numerical method, we determine that 79\% (60/76) make a comparison with a weak baseline. Second, we find evidence that reporting biases are widespread, especially outcome reporting and publication biases. We conclude that ML-for-PDE-solving research is overoptimistic: weak baselines lead to overly positive results, while reporting biases lead to under-reporting of negative results. To a large extent, these issues seem to be caused by factors similar to those of past reproducibility crises: researcher degrees of freedom and a bias towards positive results. We call for bottom-up cultural changes to minimize biased reporting as well as top-down structural reforms to reduce perverse incentives for doing so.},

The coefficient of restitution depends on the impact velocity between particles by taking into account both the viscoelastic and plastic deformations of particles, occurring at low and high velocities respectively. Use of this model of restitution coefficient leads to new unexpected behaviors. When the number of particles N is large, a loose cluster appears near the fixed wall, opposite the vibrating wall. The pressure exerted on the walls becomes independent of N, and linear in the vibration velocity V, quite as the granular temperature. The collision frequency at the vibrating wall becomes independent of both N and V, whereas at the fixed wall, it is linear in both N and V. These behaviors arise because the velocity-dependent restitution coefficient introduces a new time scale related to the collision velocity near the cross over from viscoelastic to plastic deformation.},

  abstract      = {Flow regime study was conducted in a 0.3 m diameter, 15.5 m height circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser with an abrupt exit at the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U. S. Department of Energy. Local particle velocities were measured at various radial positions and riser heights using an optical fiber probe. On-line measurement of solid circulating rate was continuously recorded by measuring the rotational speed of a twisted spiral vane located in the packed bed region of the standpipe.. Glass beads of mean diameter 61 m and particle density of 2,500 kg/m3 were used as bed material. The CFB riser was operated at various superficial gas velocities ranging from 3 to 7.6 m/s and solid mass flux from 20 to 550 kg/m2-s. At a constant riser gas velocity, transition from fast fluidization to dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime started at the bottom of the riser with increasing solid flux. Except at comparatively low riser gas velocity and solid flux, the apparent solid holdup at the top exit region was higher than the middle section of the riser. The solid fraction at this top region could be much higher than 7\% under high riser gas velocity and solid mass flux. The local particle velocity showed downward flow near the wall at the top of the riser due to its abrupt exit. This abrupt geometry reflected the solids and, therefore, caused solid particles traveling downward along the wall. However, at location below, but near, the top of the riser the local particle velocities were observed flowing upward at the wall. Therefore, DSU was identified in the upper region of the riser with an abrupt exit while the fully developed region, lower in the riser, was still exhibiting core-annular flow structure. Our data were compared with the flow regime boundaries proposed by Kim et al. [1] for distinguishing the dilute pneumatic transport, fast fluidization, and DSU.},

While a constant current (CC) charging protocol has been standard, recent studies have shown that a pulse plating (PP) charging protocol is effective at reducing dendrite growth and improving cycle life. In this study, dendrite growth at the anode-electrolyte interface was simulated using an Extended Butler-Volmer Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (eBV-SPH) model implemented in LAMMPS. Square waveform PP protocols were implemented and compared to CC results to understand the effect of charging protocols on lithium deposition and dendrite morphology. The charging conditions were controlled by the applied potential, as the model does not currently enforce galvanostatic conditions. Past studies compared CC and PP results at a single charging current density. In similar work on lithium-ion batteries, PP and CC results compared at the identical mean current resulted in little to no benefit to cycling performance. In this investigation, lithium anode PP protocols performed worse when compared with CC plating at the identical mean current. The PP and CC simulation results from the eBV-SPH model simulated the expected morphology and behavior found in experimental investigations and provide more detailed morphologies than previous computational simulations.},

  abstract      = {An integral packed-bed reactor was used to determine the kinetics of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction over a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, under operating conditions such that there was no film or intraparticle resistance. Experiments were carried out over a wide range of temperatures and space times using a typical reformate gas mixture (4.70\% CO, 34.78\% H2O, 28.70\% H2, 10.16\% CO2, balance N2). In the first part of the work, three different mechanistic-rate equations and two empirical kinetic models are proposed to describe the WGS kinetic data throughout the entire range of temperatures. To improve the independence of the parameters in using the Arrhenius and van't Hoff equations, the temperature was centered. Good agreement was obtained between the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) rate equations and the experimental results. Further, analysis using two different temperature ranges for parameter estimation revealed distinct rate-controlling mechanisms for each range. For temperatures of 180-200 \textdegree{}C, the associative (LH) mechanism was predominant, whereas the redox pathway showed the best fit to the experimental reaction rates in the range of 230-300 \textdegree{}C. Finally, an isothermal plug-flow reactor model was used to simulate the packed-bed tubular reactor for the WGS reaction using the composed kinetics. The reactor model was assessed against the experimental CO outlet concentration, and satisfactory agreement was found between the model predictions and the experimental results.},

  abstract      = {Waste orange peel represents a heavy burden for the orange juice industry, estimated in several million tons per year worldwide; nevertheless, this by-product is endowed with valuable bioactive compounds, such as pectin, polyphenols, and terpenes. The potential value of the waste orange peel has stimulated the search for extraction processes, alternative or complementary to landfilling or to the integral energy conversion. This study introduces controlled hydrodynamic cavitation as a new route to the integral valorization of this by-product, based on simple equipment, speed, effectiveness and efficiency, scalability, and compliance with green extraction principles. Waste orange peel, in batches of several kg, was processed in more than 100 L of water, without any other raw materials, in a device comprising a Venturi-shaped cavitation reactor. The extractions of pectin (with a remarkably low degree of esterification), polyphenols (flavanones and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives), and terpenes (mainly d-limonene) were effective and efficient (high yields within a few min of process time). The biomethane generation potential of the process residues was determined. The achieved results proved the viability of the proposed route to the integral valorization of waste orange peel, though wide margins exist for further improvements.},

  abstract      = {Cavitation is one of the most important aspects of the stable and safe operation of a centrifugal pump. To examine the dynamics of cavitation vortex in a centrifugal pump, the cavitating flow is investigated by using the modified shear stress transport (SST) k-\ensuremath{\omega} turbulence model with the Zwart cavitation model. The numerical results are confirmed by comparing them with those obtained from experimental tests. The results show that there is a critical cavitation number of \ensuremath{\sigma}c at each flow rate condition. As the cavitation number \ensuremath{\sigma} exceeds \ensuremath{\sigma}c, the pump head remains stable. Conversely, the head rapidly decreases when the \ensuremath{\sigma} falls below \ensuremath{\sigma}c. As the \ensuremath{\sigma} decreases, the pump experiences successively incipient cavitation, slight cavitation, and severe cavitation. At the stage of severe cavitation conditions, the vortex structures are generated at the tail of cavitation in the flow passage. The vorticity transport method is employed to analyze the vortex dynamics, and it is found that the vortex area contains high vorticity. The dominant contribution to the generation of vorticity comes from the vortex stretching and dilation terms acting in different directions. The contribution of the baroclinic torque to vorticity generation at the vapor-liquid interface is significant. The Coriolis force has a negligible impact on vorticity transport.},

We employ TensorFlow for artificial neural network training and Casadi to integrate ordinary differential equations~and provide gradients of differential model equations~enabling continuous time representations. HybridML provides also a JSON interface for the model development. We apply HybridML to an industrial case study, in which the trained model is used to predict drug concentrations over time, based on physiological information about the patients. To demonstrate its versatility, we also present a nonlinear application, where HybridML is used to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in German federal states based on the state's socio-economic attributes.},

Any complex shape which is not possible by convention fabrication technique can be fabricated using this technique. Moreover, this technique allow the innovator to develop the prototype much faster than the convention method. The complex shape prototype that chosen in this work is the radial flow centrifugal pump and it is the most common and widely used kinetic energy pump. The digital model of the centrifugal pump was prepared using the solidworks. The different component of the centrifugal pump like impeller, casing, suction and shaft also modeled and assembled. The design details of the impeller of the pump and casing is arrived after careful design calculation and it is prepared in such a way to have more efficiency of converting energy in the impeller. The impeller blades, shape, number of blades are arrived based on the total head and discharge. These impeller, suction, casing and shaft all are fabricated by using the FDM of 3D printer using ABS Plastic. The design plays a major role in preparing the centrifugal pump impeller and other components. The fabricated component should be matched accurately while assembly. Moreover, the components fabricated using the rapid prototyping solve the purpose when compare to the other conventional methods. Moreover this FDM technique is successfully benefited in manufacturing light weight prototype, tooling and creating customized design. However, the quality of prototype developed through this technique is relatively lower than the other formative or subtractive technique. This challenges in this technique is addressed by analyzing the microscopic structure of the ABS plastic and presented in this paper.},

  abstract      = {Entropy Generation Modelling (EGMod) is the topic dealing with the calculation of entropy sources in real processes. It is gaining ground since the entropy generation rate aggregates all irreversibility sources through a meaningful combination allowing to evaluate the energy-efficiency and sustainability of a given operation. Several EGMod approaches are reported in literature and are based on 1D process models or CFD simulations. 1D models are the most used given their computational efficiency, however, no study has compared their performances to CFD yet. In this paper, EGMod approaches are compared through three case studies highlighting their potentials and limitations. The results reveal that, although 1D approaches can correctly determine the temperature and concentration profiles along the process, they inherently lead to significant errors in the calculation of the entropy generation rate. These errors become important in the presence of chemical reactions as they lead to intercorrelation between local temperatures and concentrations.},

  abstract      = {The escalating demand for plastics has resulted in a surge of plastic waste worldwide, posing a monumental environmental challenge. To address this issue, a versatile photo-oxidative degradation method applicable to seven distinct polymer families is proposed, comprising poly(isobutyl vinyl ether) (PIBVE), poly(2,3-dihydrofuran) (PDHF), poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA), poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), poly(dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMA), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) (PEGMEA), and even poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). This method employs photo-mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidation to promote polymer degradation. This reaction is carried out under aerobic condition in the presence of iron trichloride (FeCl3) as a photocatalyst in combination with low-intensity purple light irradiation. The process can degrade up to 97\% of the polymer in less than 3 h. This degradation process can be easily controlled by switching the light off, which allows for precise modulation of the degradation rate, enhancing the effectiveness of the method. Overall, this method provides a sustainable method for degrading various polymer types with low energy input.},

Because these processes need to be described with coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) that must be solved numerically, the computation times for a single particle are too high for use in simulations that involve many particles. Simulations of this type arise when the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is combined with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate industrial systems such as quicklime production in lime shaft kilns. We show that, based on proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection, reduced models can be derived for single particles that provide the same spatial and temporal resolution as the original PDE models at a considerably reduced computational cost. Replacing the finite volume particle models with the reduced models results in an overall reduction of the reactor simulation time by about 40\% for the sample system treated here.},

Incorporating compact and regular design with Coiled Flow Inverter (CFI) enhances process efficiency due to improved mixing as well as heat and mass transfer leading to a narrow residence time distribution. The impact of Dean and Taylor flow phenomena on mixing and dispersion within these systems underscores their significance, but is still not yet fully understood. Direct numerical simulation based on finite element method enables full 3D resolution of the flow field and detailed examination of laminar flow profiles, providing valuable insights into flow dynamics. Notably, the deflection of flow velocity from the center axis contributes is followed by tracking of particle with defined starting positions, aiding in flow visualization and dispersion characterization. In this CFD study, the helical flow with the influence of the centrifugal force and pitch (Dean flow) as well as the capillary two-phase flow (Taylor bubble) is described and characterized by particle dispersion and related histograms. Future prospects in this field include advancements in imaging techniques to capture intricate flow patterns, as well as refined particle tracking methods to better understand complex flow behavior.},

A stochastic approach is used to derive the population balance equation describing the variation of the density function of temperature distribution of the particulate phase. The moment equations and numerical solution of the partial integro-differential equation of the population balance model are derived and used to analyse the behaviour of a batch gas–solid system. The results indicate that the population balance approach, used for developing the model describing the inter-particle contact heat conduction during collision capable to take into account a number of parameters affecting the process, can be applied also for predicting heat transfer in gas–solid processing systems.},

  abstract      = {Implementation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for design of tactical missile systems is a well-established method in the literature. However, this methodology, being computationally expensive, leads to a significantly high amount of time when run-in combinations with iterative algorithms such as the evolutionary optimization. The idea of replacing these CFD models with machine learning–based surrogate models, if possible, can be highly useful in this regard. Among many such machine learning models, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are shown to be promising candidates for capturing nonlinearities involved in the first principles–based models (FPMs). However, heuristic-based determination of hyperparameters in ANNs became a barrier toward their successful implementation as surrogates. In this work, authors propose a novel multiobjective evolutionary optimization approach that aims to achieve optimal estimation of such hyperparameters: architecture, sample size for training, and choice of activation, simultaneously at the time of building ANN surrogates. The data for training the ANN models is obtained from the high-fidelity time-expensive CFD simulations for modeling the supersonic-flow over a cruciform missile system. The optimal surrogate models, built with an accuracy of 99\%, are then used to generate the predictions for performing uncertainty analysis of individual effects and interaction effects of three design parameters: flux type, discretization order, and models for turbulence in ANSYS FLUENT on three variables of interest: the drag coefficient, the lift coefficient, and the coefficient of rolling moment of the missile using analysis of variance (ANOVA).},

  abstract      = {High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for design space explorations can be exceedingly expensive due to the cost associated with resolving the finer scales. This computational cost/accuracy trade-off is a major challenge for modern CFD simulations. In the present study, we propose a method that uses a trained machine learning model that has learned to predict the discretization error as a function of largescale flow features to inversely estimate the degree of lost information due to mesh coarsening. This information is then added back to the low-resolution solution during runtime, thereby enhancing the quality of the under-resolved coarse mesh simulation. The use of a coarser mesh produces a non-linear benefit in speed while the cost of inferring and correcting for the lost information has a linear cost. We demonstrate the numerical stability of a problem of engineering interest, a 3D turbulent channel flow. In addition to this demonstration, we further show the potential for speedup without sacrificing solution accuracy using this method, thereby making the cost/accuracy trade-off of CFD more favorable.},

Deriving high-value biomolecules from micro-algae however faces numerous process and technological challenges. It is essential to develop innovative ways of intensifying processes used for valorising microalgae. Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) offers an attractive platform for process intensification relevant to microalgae because of its scalability, ability to handle dense slurries, intense physicochemical effects, and low cost. Here we briefly review the overall processes involved in deriving high-value biomolecules from micro-algae. Opportunities for intensifying these processes and enhancing productivity of processing microalgae via HC are then identified and critically reviewed. The current state of the art and yet unresolved challenges are highlighted. An attempt is made to identify specific suggestions to help direct future research efforts. The review will be useful for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness HC for deriving high-value products from microalgae.},

To this end, a PINN is developed utilizing the first-principles model of the system and plant data and demonstrated to handle plant–model mismatch. The PINN is compared with another dynamic modeling technique, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and for the illustrative simulation example, is shown to improve the predictive capabilities of the model compared to the other techniques. In particular, purely data-driven approaches often encounter challenges when applied to complex systems. This can lead to compromised predictive performance in situations where the model fails to capture the actual relationships among system variables. In contrast, the PINN respects the physical characteristics of the problem, while yielding a good dynamic model, based on process data.

The two-phase intermolecular potential model was utilized to investigate the microscopic behavior of the electrolyte flow in the porous electrodes. The results showed that embedding microchannels inside the electrodes significantly improves the wettability of the electrodes, especially for the electrodes with lower porosities. Furthermore, the use of microchannels inside the electrodes could considerably reduce possibility of occurrence of the thermal runaway.

The primary goal of a ROM is to model the key physics/features of a flow-field without computing the full Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. This is accomplished by projecting the high-dimensional dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace, typically utilizing dimensionality reduction techniques like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), coupled with Galerkin projection. In this work, we demonstrate a deep learning based approach to build a ROM using the POD basis of canonical DNS datasets, for turbulent flow control applications. We find that a type of Recurrent Neural Network, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which has been primarily utilized for problems like speech modeling and language translation, shows attractive potential in modeling temporal dynamics of turbulence. Additionally, we introduce the Hurst Exponent as a tool to study LSTM behavior for non-stationary data, and uncover useful characteristics that may aid ROM development for a variety of applications.},

Due to an additional pressure gradient due to turbulent velocity uctuations the radial bubble motion in case of an ori\"{y}ce ow is a combination of both stable and oscillatory type.

  abstract      = {In recent years, although an increasing number of literature have been devoted to circulating fluidized bed (CFB), the prediction of velocities over which different fluidization regimes exist is still difficult. In this study, a transient method was applied which readily allows one to identify operational features and critical transitions. The method is based on stopping the solids flow rate into the riser when riser is operating in fully dense transport regime. The analysis of transient pressure drop data across the riser during a solids flow cut-off experiment against its time derivative demonstrate the three distinct operating regimes that exist as the gas deplete the solid out of the riser. The transient was compared to data taken under steady state operations using statistically designed experiments. Results indicated that although there were significant differences when comparing operations in dilute conditions, there were no significant differences between the two methods in the fast fluidized and dense transport regimes. The transient method was capable of reproducing the solids circulation dependence on riser solids holdup and on the axial pressure profile. This transient method offers an accurate, easy, rapid, and reproducible means of characterizing CFB operations over a wide range of flow conditions. The lack of accuracy in the dilute regime is conjectured to be due to the wide particle size distribution that resulted in segregation during the transient testing.},

A single unambiguous experimental method was developed to identify the transitions between CFB operating regimes. Experiments were conducted at riser gas velocities ranging from dense phase turbulent, through fast fluidization (S-shape riser pressure profile), and up to dilute-phase flow regimes. A transient method was applied to a low density, Geldart Type B, cork bed material. Two distinct transition velocities were found by analyzing the time required to empty out all solids from the riser of the CFB after cutting off solids flow. The lowest transition velocity marked the transition between the dense-phase turbulent and the fast fluidization flow regimes, while a higher or second transition represented the transition between the fast fluidization and the dilute-phase flow regimes. Based on the experimental results, the axial pressures and its fluctuations along the riser exhibited markedly distinct profiles in each of the three different operating flow regime regions as defined by these two transport velocities.},

A variable property grain model was applied to account for the kinetic reaction of hydrogen sulfide with zinc oxide. Grain radius was assumed to vary under the combined effect of sintering and extend of reaction. All model parameters were obtained from literature correlations or independent experimental measurements. The model predictions were validated against experimental data from a bench-scale transport reactor. Tests were conducted with 70 m ZnO particles in a nitrogen stream with 1\% H2S at 2100 kPa and 811 K. The sorbent was recycled through the system to simulate 10 passes through the reactor. Significant improvement in the comparison with experimental results was achieved when compared to a constant property grain model. The model was also used to perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of operating temperature, pressure, H2S concentration, and particle size on the hot gas desulfurization performance.},

  abstract      = {The deactivation of a silver catalyst for the selective oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide was investigated after six years of industrial use. Some tubes of the reactor were unloaded and the catalyst was divided into five parts: sample U1 at the gas inlet (top of the reactor) to sample U5 at the gas outlet were compared with fresh catalyst (F). This permitted the determination of a deactivation profile along the reactor. The performances of the fresh and discharged catalysts were examined in an internal recycle reactor in the range 503 – 543 K. The rate of ethylene oxidation (at a constant feed composition and reaction temperature) and the selectivity to ethylene oxide (at a constant ethylene conversion) varied according to the sequence F \gg{} U5 \cong{} U4 \cong{} U3 {$>$} U2 {\$>\$} U1. At the same temperature, U1 and U2 were not only the least active, but also the least selective catalysts. The specific rate of ethylene oxidation (based on O2 chemisorption data) followed a reverse sequence: U1 \cong{} U2 {\$>\$} U4 {\$>\$} F. The apparent activation energies for the formation of ethylene oxide and of carbon dioxide were lower for U1 than for the other samples. Catalyst U1 was peculiar also for the temperature oscillations occurring in the reactor. The physico-chemical characterization of the samples has shown that (i) contamination by sulphur decreases from U1 to U5, (ii) oxygen uptake varies according to the sequence F {\$>\$} U4 {\$>\$} U2 \cong{} U1, (iii) silver sintering occurred in the discharged catalysts and seems to be more pronounced for the top levels of the reactor tube and (1v) for some silver particles, changes of morphology accompany the metal sintering. Based on the previous literature, these findings were examined as possible explanations of the modified performances of the discharged catalyst.},

Inside a circulating uidized bed a single cluster has a signi\"{y}cant e ect on the gas that ows around it. Recent experiments have suggested that large scale gas uctuations occur as the air ows around the cluster body. This paper examines the e ect a single cluster has on the surrounding gas ow. Experimental work focuses on a small riser with the ability to release a single cluster. A specially designed probe measures the gas velocity as the cluster travels by. Numerical work simulates the e ect of air ow around a porous body. The uctuation levels observed are comparable to the experiments. Both results show that large scale velocity uctuations occur in the gas in the vicinity of a cluster.

  abstract      = {A parametric study investigating the impact of temperature, run duration, total pressure, and composition of the gaseous phase on the catalytic growth of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) has been performed. MWCNTs have been produced very selectively on the multi-gram scale by catalytic chemical vapor deposition from ethylene in a fluidized bed reactor. The kinetics of MWCNTs growth is fast and, with the catalyst used, no induction period has been observed. The kinetic law is of positive order in ethylene concentration and the process is limited by internal diffusion in the porosity of the catalyst. The formation of MWCNTs in the macroporosity of the catalyst induces an explosion of the catalyst grains. Such a process, thanks to the absence of temperature gradient and to the efficient mixing of the grains allows a uniform and selective treatment of the catalyst powder leading to very high selectivity towards MWCNTs formation. High purity MWCNTs have been obtained after catalyst dissolution. Depending on the temperature of production, the specific surface area of this material ranged between 95 and 455 m2/g.},

The height of the interface is significantly affected by the solid inventory, and is also greatly affected by the design of the pneumatic valve.

Movement of a tracer was monitored by radioactive particle tracking \v{Z}RPT. technique. Once the time-position data became available, local axial and radial diffusivity of solids were calculated from these data.

The results show that the diffusivities, both axial and radial, increase with superficial gas velocity and are linearly correlated to the axial solid velocity gradient.

This study employs the wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity large eddy simulation (WALE-LES) turbulence model combined with the Zwart–Gerber–Belamri cavitation model to conduct transient numerical simulations on the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 0015 baseline hydrofoil and the hydrofoil equipped with mVGs under various cavitation numbers. The proper orthogonal decomposition method and experiments verify the accuracy and consistency of these simulations regarding cavity scale. The study elucidates mechanisms by which mVGs suppress cloud cavitation at low cavitation numbers and induce vortex cavitation at high cavitation numbers. Results indicate that mVGs maintain sheet cavitation characteristics at low cavitation numbers, reducing wall pressure fluctuations and enhancing flow stability. During cavitation inception, mVG-induced vortex cavitation leads to early cavitation formation. In the sheet cavitation phase, modal energy distribution is more dispersed, while in the inception phase, energy is concentrated with significant dominant modes. Moreover, the counter-rotating vortices generated by mVGs mitigate flow separation, enhance leading-edge flow attachment stability, and reduce high-frequency vibrations caused by bubble shedding. This study significantly advances the understanding of cavitation control by accurately simulating and revealing the cavitation control mechanisms of mVGs across different stages using the WALE-LES model. The findings demonstrate that mVGs can effectively stabilize cavity structures at low cavitation numbers, reducing flow instabilities and enhancing overall hydrofoil performance. These insights will have a significant impact on the design of hydrofoils and the development of cavitation control strategies.},

  abstract      = {Currently, hydrogen is mainly generated by steam methane reforming, with significant CO2 emissions, thus exacerbating the greenhouse effect. This environmental concern promotes methane cracking, which represents one of the most promising alternatives for hydrogen production with theoretical zero CO/CO2 emissions. Methane cracking has been intensively investigated using metallic and carbonaceous catalysts. Recently, research has focused on methane pyrolysis in molten metals/salts to prevent both reactor coking and rapid catalyst deactivation frequently encountered in conventional pyrolysis. Another expected advantage is the heat transfer improvement due to the high heat capacity of molten media. Apart from the reaction itself that produces hydrogen and solid carbon, the energy source used in this endothermic process can also contribute to reducing environmental impacts. While most researchers used nonrenewable sources based on fossil fuel combustion or electrical heating, concentrated solar energy has not been thoroughly investigated, to date, for pyrolysis in molten media. However, it could be a promising innovative pathway to further improve hydrogen production sustainability from methane cracking. After recalling the basics of conventional catalytic methane cracking and the developed solar cracking reactors, this review delves into the most significant results of the state-of-the-art methane pyrolysis in melts (molten metals and salts) to show the advantages and the perspectives of this new path, as well as the carbon products' characteristics and the main factors governing methane conversion.},

  abstract      = {Methane pyrolysis is a transitional technology for environmentally benign hydrogen production with zero greenhouse gas emissions, especially when concentrated solar energy is the heating source for supplying high-temperature process heat. This study is focused on solar methane pyrolysis as an attractive decarbonization process to produce both hydrogen gas and solid carbon with zero CO2 emissions. Direct normal irradiance (DNI) variations arising from inherent solar resource variability (clouds, fog, day-night cycle, etc.) generally hinder continuity and stability of the solar process. Therefore, a novel hybrid solar/electric reactor was designed at PROMES-CNRS laboratory to cope with DNI variations. Such a design features electric heating when the DNI is low and can potentially boost the thermochemical performance of the process when coupled solar/electric heating is applied thanks to an enlarged heated zone. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations through ANSYS Fluent were performed to investigate the performance of this reactor under different operating conditions. More particularly, the influence of various process parameters including temperature, gas residence time, methane dilution, and hybridization on the methane conversion was assessed. The model combined fluid flow hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer coupled with gas-phase pyrolysis reactions. Increasing the heating temperature was found to boost methane conversion (91\% at 1473 K against \textasciitilde 100\% at 1573 K for a coupled solar-electric heating). The increase of inlet gas flow rate Q0 lowered methane conversion since it affected the gas space-time (91\% at Q0 = 0.42 NL/min vs. 67\% at Q0 = 0.84 NL/min). A coupled heating also resulted in significantly better performance than with only electric heating, because it broadened the hot zone (91\% vs. 75\% methane conversion for coupled heating and only electric heating, respectively). The model was further validated with experimental results of methane pyrolysis. This study demonstrates the potential of the hybrid reactor for solar-driven methane pyrolysis as a promising route toward clean hydrogen and carbon production and further highlights the role of key parameters to improve the process performance.},

  abstract      = {Rotary cement kilns are used for converting calcineous raw meal into cement clinkers. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate possible ways of reducing energy consumption in rotary cement kilns. A comprehensive one-dimensional model was developed to simulate complex processes occurring in rotary cement kilns. A modeling strategy comprising three submodels, viz. a model for simulating the variation of bed height in the kiln, a model for simulating reactions and heat transfer in the bed region, and a model for simulating coal combustion and heat transfer in the freeboard region, was developed. Melting and formation of coating within the kiln were accounted for. Combustion of coal in the freeboard region was modeled by accounting for devolatilization, finite-rate gas-phase combustion, and char reaction. The simulated results were validated with the available data from three industrial kilns. The model was then used to understand the influence of various design and operating parameters on kiln performance. Several ways of reducing energy consumption in kilns were then computationally investigated. The model was also used to propose and to evaluate a practical solution of using a secondary shell to reduce energy consumption in rotary cement kilns. Simulation results indicate that varying kiln operating variables, viz. solid flow rate or RPM, can result only in small changes in kiln energetics. Use of a secondary shell over the kiln and energy recovery by passing air through the annular gap between the two appears to be a promising way to achieve significant energy savings. The developed model and the presented results will be useful for enhancing the performance of rotary cement kilns.}

  abstract      = {This paper presents an integrated reaction engineering based mathematical model for clinker formation in cement industry. Separate models for pre-heater, calciner, rotary kiln and cooler were initially developed and coupled together to build an integrated simulator. Appropriate models for simulating gas–solid contact and heat transfer in pre-heaters were developed. Calciner was modeled by considering simultaneous combustion of coal particles and calcination of raw meal. Complex heat transfer and reactions (solid–solid, gas–solid and homogeneous reactions in gas phase) in rotary kiln were modeled using three sub-models coupled to each other. Solid–solid reactions in the bed region of the kiln were modeled using pseudo-homogeneous approximation. Melting of solids in the bed and formation of coating within the kiln were accounted. Clinker cooler was simulated by developing a two-dimensional model to capture cross-flow heat transfer between air and hot clinkers. The individual models were coupled with each other via mass and energy communication through common boundaries. The coupled model equations were solved iteratively. The model predictions agree well with the observations and experience from cement industry. The model was used to gain better understanding of influence of operating conditions on energy consumption in cement plant. Several ways for reducing energy consumption were computationally investigated. The integrated model, the developed software RoCKS (for Rotary Cement Kiln Simulator) and results presented here will be useful for enhancing our understanding and for enhancing the performance of clinker manufacturing.},

  abstract      = {Rotary cement kilns are widely used to convert calcineous raw meal into cement clinker, and are key components in the cement industry. In this article, we report a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based model to capture key transport processes in rotary cement kilns. Separate but coupled computational models were developed for the bed and the freeboard regions of the rotary kiln. The complex swirling airflow produced by kiln burners, coal combustion, gas-phase combustion of volatile matter and radiative heat transfer in the freeboard region were modeled. The clinkerization reactions in the bed region were modeled assuming solids as pseudo fluids. Coating formation in cement kilns (for both bed and freeboard regions) was considered. Appropriate source and sink terms were developed to model transfer of CO2 from the bed to the freeboard region due to calcination reaction in the bed region. The developed bed and freeboard models were coupled by mass and energy communication through common interface. These coupled computational models were able to quite satisfactorily predict the available data from industrial kilns and previously published results. The computational models were also able to capture the intricacies of the burning zones of rotary cement kilns for changing burner-operational parameters like axial to swirl ratio and oxygen enrichment. The developed approach, computational models and simulation results will not only help in developing better understanding of cement kilns but also provide quantitative information about influence of burner design and other design parameters on kiln performance.

This work assesses the commercialization potential of Bio-CNG production from sugarcane bagasse by performing a detailed techno-economic and life cycle assessment (LCA). The process under consideration uses hydrodynamic cavitation as pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion based bagasse valorization and biogas upgradation using water scrubbing. Experimental data for cavitation and anaerobic digestion are combined with process simulation data for upgradation and compression. Process design and economics methods are used to perform techno-economic assessment (TEA) for plants producing 5 and 10 TPD Bio-CNG. For LCA, 1~kg of Bio-CNG is used as a functional unit. Inventory data were obtained from experiments, process simulation, and Ecoinvent\textregistered{} database v 3.3. The Bio-CNG production cost for a 5 TPD plant was \$ 1.29 /kg (₹ 96/kg) which decreased to \$ 1.18/kg (₹ 87/kg) for a 10 TPD plant. For a 5 TPD plant, the production cost could potentially reduce to \$ 0.51 /kg (₹ 37/kg) if bagasse and electricity were available for free. The total climate change impact for 1~kg of Bio-CNG was 1.55~kg CO2 eq., and the electricity source significantly contributed to the total impact. Considering the source of CNG used in the transport sector in India, Bio-CNG provided a net benefit (reduction) of 3.96~kg CO2 eq. per kg Bio-CNG.},

The efficiency of the extraction process is hampered by the toxicity, non-biodegradability, and recycling of solvents associated with two-phase extraction. In comparison to conventional fermentation and purification techniques, extractive fermentation has several benefits such as higher product yields, lower costs for subsequent processing, and the ability to~synthesize~molecules that are challenging to recover using traditional methods. Extractive fermentation is a sustainable method for enhanced product recovery with the adaptability of reactor and solvent recyclability.

  abstract      = {Hydrogen production plants are among major sources of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The objective of this paper is to explore new routes to hydrogen production from natural gas (or methane) with drastically reduced CO2 emissions. One approach analyzed in this paper is based on thermocatalytic decomposition (or pyrolysis) of methane into hydrogen gas and elemental carbon over carbon-based catalysts. Several heat input options to the endothermic process are discussed in the paper. The authors conduct thermodynamic analysis of methane decomposition in the presence of small amounts of oxygen in an autothermal (or thermo-neutral) regime using AspenPlus\texttrademark{} chemical process simulator. Methane conversion, products yield, effluent gas composition, process enthalpy flows as a function of temperature, pressure and O2/CH4 ratio has been determined. CO2 emissions (per m3 of H2 produced) from the process could potentially be a factor of 3–5 less than from conventional hydrogen production processes. Oxygen-assisted decomposition of methane over activated carbon (AC) and AC-supported iron catalysts over wide range of temperatures and O2/CH4 ratios was experimentally verified. Problems associated with the catalyst deactivation and the effect of iron doping on the catalyst stability are discussed.},

  abstract      = {In this paper a computational analysis of the dynamic vortex-cavitation flow observed on the so-called twist-11 Delft hydrofoil (Foeth 2008) is presented. Flow calculations are performed using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) as well as Improved Delayed Detached-Eddy simulation (IDDES) models available in the commercial software STAR-CCM+. The flow-field is realized as a continuous mixture of liquid and vapor bubbles, in the context of the Eulerian Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. For predicting growth/collapse oscillations of cavitation bubbles, the multiphase VOF solver is coupled with different cavitation models based on the Rayleigh-Plesset (R-P) equation. Parametric simulations tested include the asymptotic formulation proposed by Sauer (2000) and the classical R-P equation, which also accounts for the inertia of bubbles as well as surfacetension and viscous effects (Brennen 1995). The obtained results are validated against reported experimental measurements in terms of the lift force and the vortex shedding frequency. In addition, model predictions are also compared against equivalent Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations reported in the literature (Hoekstra et al 2011, Bensow 2011). The evaluation of the predicted results suggests that inertial effects of cavitating bubbles have a major impact on the transient characteristics of multiscale vortex cavitation flows.},

Molasses spent wash (120,000\,ppm COD, India) and vinasse (27,000\,ppm COD, Brazil) were pre-treated at varying number of passes (between 1 and 20) through the HC device at constant inflow, biochemical methanation potential (BMP) was measured and described using a first order model. Vortex-based HC pre-treatment led to 14\% enhancement (2 passes) in BMP from spent wash (difficult to digest compared to vinasse) with a net energy gain of 1\,GJ/ton COD. 10–22\% increase in biogas yields from large-scale industrial spent wash digesters confirmed the laboratory findings. The work presented is useful and can be translated to recalcitrant feedstock for enhancing valorization using vortex-based HC pre-treatment.},

Literature reporting the investigation of various biomass pretreatments often use milled biomass as substrate rather than as-received fibrous biomass. This does not establish the true influence of the pretreatment type on biogas generation. Additionally, milling energy is also ignored when calculating net energy gains from enhanced biogas yields and are thus misleading. In this work, a vortex-based hydrodynamic cavitation device was used to enhance the biomethane yields from fibrous as-received biomass for the first time. Clear justification on why milled biomass must not be used as substrates for demonstrating the effect of pretreatment on biogas production is also discussed. The net energy gain from milled hydrodynamic cavitation pre-treated bagasse can be similar to as-received bagasse only when the specific milling energy is \leq{}700 kWh/ton.},

  abstract      = {Carbon dioxide emission from anthropogenic sources plays a major role in global warming and climate change. Conventional amine-based carbon capture is matured technology that has limitations on high-temperature use imposed by solvent degradation and solvent loss during CO2 stripping/regenerating solvent. The present experimental investigation involves the application of tank-type (bath-type) sonication for CO2 stripping from aqueous carbon-rich 30 wt\% MEA solvent in a low temperature-controlled environment, using ultrasonic frequencies of 25 kHz (cavitation-dominant), 360 kHz (streaming-dominant), and 58/132 kHz dual-mode (combined phenomena). The results are analyzed to understand the effects of carbon loading, CO2 stripping efficiency, stripping rate, temperature profile, and energy demand. The stripping rate is higher in the low-temperature range of 6\textdegree{}C to 12\textdegree{}C for all the frequencies due to the sonication effect. In the mid setpoint range of 15\textdegree{}C to 30\textdegree{}C, the CO2 stripping rate is lower due to the combination of sonication and temperature effect, and when the temperatures increase from 40\textdegree{}C to 45\textdegree{}C, the stripping rate increases gradually due to additional temperature effect. A high cyclic capacity of 1.12 mol CO2/kg. was observed for 360 kHz frequency at 12\textdegree{}C. The lowest energy of 3.94 kJ/mol CO2 was achieved for 360 kHz at a setpoint of 12\textdegree{}C. Factors such as sonication frequency, CO2 loading (mol CO2/mol soln.), temperature, and nominal power of ultrasonics play an important role in determining the sensible energy required for CO2 stripping. Specifically, CO2 stripping at the low temperature set point of 6\textdegree{}C and 12\textdegree{}C is found to be promising in all frequencies, indicating that CO2 stripping is primarily promoted by sonication, rather than by temperature.},

In this work, we utilize kinetics-informed neural networks (KINNs), which are artificial feedforward neural networks designed to solve ordinary differential equations constrained by micro-kinetic models, to model the TAP data. We demonstrate that, under the assumption that all concentrations are known in the thin catalyst zone, KINNs can simultaneously fit the transient data, retrieve the kinetic model parameters, and interpolate unseen pulse behavior for multi-pulse experiments. We further demonstrate that, by modifying the loss function, KINNs maintain these capabilities even when precise thin-zone information is unavailable, as would be the case with real experimental TAP data. We also compare the approach to existing optimization techniques, which reveals improved noise tolerance and performance in extracting kinetic parameters. The KINNs approach offers an efficient alternative for TAP analysis and can assist in interpreting transient kinetics in complex systems over long timescales.},

This work attempts to understand and investigate the influence of formation of such clusters on effective drag between gas and solid phases using the energy minimization multi scale (EMMS) model. Unlike previous works on EMMS, the model is investigated outside the CFD domain and predictions were compared with the experimental data for risers and downers. The predicted drag coefficient from the EMMS approach was evaluated for its sensitivity with respect to model parameters. Though overall picture postulated in EMMS looks promising, the critical examination of EMMS for simulating gas solid flows reveal some limitations of the EMMS model. The minimum energy consumption was obtained at lowest possible of cluster voidage, arbitrarily assumed in the model simulation. The cluster voidage significantly affected the predicted drag coefficient. Possible ways to minimize or eliminate some of the limitations were also discussed. The results presented in this work will provide a useful basis for further improvements in the EMMS framework and for further work on gas –solid flows.},

The Eulerian framework was used for the gas-phase, whereas the Lagrangian approach was used for the particle-phase. The steady-state equations of conservation of mass and momentum were used for the gas-phase, and the effect of turbulence on the flow-field was included via the standard k–e model. The particle equation of motion included the drag, the Saffman lift and the gravity forces. Turbulence dispersion effect on the particles was simulated as a continuous Gaussian random field. The effects of particles on the flow were modeled by appropriate source terms in the momentum, k and e equations. Particle–particle collisions and particle–wall collisions were accounted for in these simulations. Gas-phase velocities and turbulence kinetic energy in the presence of 2–100\% mass loadings of two particle classes (50 lm glass and 70 lm copper) were evaluated, and the results were compared with the available experimental data and earlier numerical results. The simulation results showed that when the inter-particle collisions were important and was included in the computational model, the fluid turbulence was attenuated. The level of turbulence attenuation increased with particle mass loading, particle Stokes number, and the distance from the wall. When the inter-particle collisions were negligible and/or was neglected in the model, the fluid turbulence was augmented for the range of particle sizes considered.},

Attention is also now being paid to sequestering CO2 from the combustion process and eliminating discharge to the atmosphere from the major source points. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a promising concept that can be used in power generation, which integrates power production and CO2 capture. In the present study, a commercially obtained iron ore was used as an oxygen carrier and the associated reduction reaction kinetics parameters have been estimated based on isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in reducing environments. The iron oxide in the ore, which is initially Fe2O3, proceeds through a sequence of reaction steps and can ultimately end up as metallic iron. The reduction mechanism for the first stage reaction (i.e., Fe2O3 to Fe3O4) was evaluated using a number of different gas–solid reaction models. The results indicate that the Avrami–Erofe'ev model can be successfully applied to the experimental data. Through this approach, it was confirmed that the initial reaction stage is phase-boundary-controlled, which gradually transitions to diffusion control. The apparent activation energy was estimated and compared with values from the literature data.},

Good agreement was found between the model results during validation against the available information under identical operating conditions. The model predicts the behavior of the EO reaction and demonstrates the extent of catalyst utilization with product distribution, product yield, by-product formation, temperature and concentration profiles, over time and along the length of the reactor or catalyst bed.

  abstract      = {Vaporization and cracking of liquid oil injected in a gas–solid riser (fluid catalytic cracking riser reactor) was computationally studied in this work. Evaporation of a single drop injected in a stream of gas–solid mixture was analyzed first. A model for simulating evaporation of a drop considering heat transfer from the gas phase as well as from the solid particles was developed. The model relates the evaporation rate of droplet with rate of collisions of solid particles, specific heat capacities of solid and liquid, latent heat of vaporization, relative velocity of gas and liquid and temperatures of three phases. The understanding gained from such a model was then extended to simulate evaporation of liquid drops injected in FCC risers. The Eulerian–Lagrangian approach was used to simulate simultaneous evaporation and cracking reactions occurring in FCC riser reactors. A commercial CFD code, FLUENT (of Fluent Inc., USA) was used. Four and ten lump models were used for simulating cracking reactions. Appropriate user defined functions were developed to implement heterogeneous kinetics and heat transfer models in FLUENT. A special algorithm was developed to calculate accumulated coke on catalyst particles. A boiling point range was considered for simulating realistic oil feedstock. The model was first evaluated by comparing predicted results with published industrial data. The simulations were then carried out to understand influence of key design and operating parameters on performance of FCC riser reactors. The parameters studied included; initial oil droplet distribution, catalyst inlet temperature, catalyst to oil ratio and thermal cracking. The approach, model and results presented here would be useful for optimization of FCC operation, cost to benefit analysis of new FCC nozzles and related decision-making.},

In this modeling framework, it is demonstrated that the integration of first-principles models and machine-learning approaches accurately predicts the dynamics of the system. The first-principles model used in this study incorporates population balance and mass balance models combined with the kinetic expressions of the agglomeration and breakage phenomena. The predictive abilities of such modeling framework is compared with a fully first-principles model, and moreover with a hybrid model that was developed in a prior work, which used a population balance model as the first principles model and a deep learning algorithm for the determination of the flocculation kinetic parameters.},

This work investigates the energy efficiency of different grinding circuits used for upgrading the lithium content in the finer fraction of the calcined spodumene ore. The results showed that closed-circuit grinding resulted in 89\% lithium recovery of the finest size fractions (-\,0.6~mm) while open-circuit grinding led to 65\% lithium recovery for the same grinding time. Closed-circuit grinding consumed lower energy than open-circuit grinding. The grade of the finest size fraction in the case of the open-circuit grinding was 1.7 times more than that in the case of the closed-circuit grinding. This work shows the potential of using different grinding modes to maximize energy efficiency and lithium deportment by size. However, it is suggested that open circuit grinding should be used for beneficiations of spodumene ores.},

  abstract      = {On top of machine learning (ML) models, uncertainty quantification (UQ) functions as an essential layer of safety assurance that could lead to more principled decision making by enabling sound risk assessment and management. The safety and reliability improvement of ML models empowered by UQ has the potential to significantly facilitate the broad adoption of ML solutions in high-stakes decision settings, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and aviation, to name a few. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a holistic lens on emerging UQ methods for ML models with a particular focus on neural networks and the applications of these UQ methods in tackling engineering design as well as prognostics and health management problems. Towards this goal, we start with a comprehensive classification of uncertainty types, sources, and causes pertaining to UQ of ML models. Next, we provide a tutorial-style description of several state-of-the-art UQ methods: Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural network, neural network ensemble, and deterministic UQ methods focusing on spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process. Established upon the mathematical formulations, we subsequently examine the soundness of these UQ methods quantitatively and qualitatively (by a toy regression example) to examine their strengths and shortcomings from different dimensions. Then, we review quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the quality of predictive uncertainty in classification and regression problems. Afterward, we discuss the increasingly important role of UQ of ML models in solving challenging problems in engineering design and health prognostics. Two case studies with source codes available on GitHub are used to demonstrate these UQ methods and compare their performance in the life prediction of lithium-ion batteries at the early stage (case study 1) and the remaining useful life prediction of turbofan engines (case study 2).},

To simulate the overall crushing circuit, the multi-geometry procedure by improving the routines of object files importing into the simulation environment was implemented in DEM codes. The calibration of DEM parameters was performed using the observed angle of the pile formed on the conveyor (surcharge angle). Various feed chute designs were then employed in the simulations based on an experimental design to find more uniform feed distribution on the distribution plate of the crusher. More uniform feed distribution was obtained by changing the shape of feed chute from cubic to cylindrical, decreasing its surface area from 0.34 to 0.24~m2 and increasing the cylinder length above and below the feed chute plate from 0 to 45~cm and from 53 to 74~cm, respectively. This was verified by proximity of center of the mass of distributed feed to the center of crusher distribution plate. After installing the new feed chute design in the plant, a detail monitoring over a period of 15~months showed a reduction of the standard deviation of crusher power draw from 13 to 3~kW. A better crusher control, 36\% increase in the crusher throughput and finer and narrower product size distribution were among the main outcomes of the new feed chute. It was concluded that the wear rate on mantle and liners of crusher not only decreased but it also became uniform.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents the modeling of a desiccant wheel used for dehumidifying the ventilation air of an air-conditioning system. The simulation of the combined heat and mass transfer processes that occur in a solid desiccant wheel is carried out with MATLAB Simulink. Using the numerical method, the performance of an adiabatic rotary dehumidifier is parametrically studied, and the optimal rotational speed is determined by examining the outlet adsorption-side humidity profiles. The solutions of the simulation at different conditions used in air dehumidifier have been investigated according to the previous published studies. The model is validated through comparison the simulated results with the published actual values of an experimental work. This method is useful to study and modelling of solid desiccant dehumidification and cooling system. The modeling solutions are used to develop simple correlations for the outlet air conditions of humidity and temperature of air through the wheel as a function of the physically measurable input variables. These correlations will be used to simulate the desiccant cooling cycle in an HVAC system in order to define the year round efficiency.},

The amplitude and frequency distribution of pressure fluctuations measured in both beds agree closely when these parameters are appropriately nondimensionalized. Thus, bubble characteristics of the two beds should be similar. Disagreements are shown to exist when all the nondimensional parameters are not kept equal between the hot bed and cold model. Variations in the particle size distribution and sphericity also cause non-similar behavior. When the hot bed material is used in the cold bed, there are significant disagreements between the behavior of the two beds. 8 references, 13 figures, 5 tables.},

  abstract      = {Long-distance transport and long-term storage of hydrogen can be realized with Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) based on a two-step cycle: (1) loading of hydrogen (hydrogenation) into the LOHC molecule (i.e., hydrogen is covalently bound to the LOHC) and (2) unloading of hydrogen (dehydrogenation) after transport and storage. Since the (optimal) LOHC is liquid at ambient conditions and shows similar properties to crude oil based liquids (e.g. diesel, and gasoline), handling and storage is realized by well-known processes; thus stepwise adaptation of the existing crude oil based infrastructure is basically possible. Against this background, a defined process chain for intercontinental ship transport of hydrogen (5000 km) is simulated with various LOHCs. The respective results are evaluated and assessed related to their technological and economic performance. Additionally, they are compared to a pipeline-based provision chain based on compressed hydrogen (CGH2). Among others, the results show that methanol is the cheapest LOHC option for storage and transportation followed by dibenzyltoluene and toluene. For a storage time of 60 days they show economic advantages compared to compressed hydrogen (CGH2) under the defined assumptions; thus these LOHC options are especially advantageous for long-term storage/long distance transport applications. The energetic efficiency of the systems mainly depends on the source of the dehydrogenation heat. Two options, dehydrogenation driven by hydrogen burning vs. dehydrogenation driven by waste heat, have been evaluated in this study. Systems that run on waste heat perform much better in terms of efficiency. Overall, LOHCs can provide technologically efficient and economic promising storage and transport within a sustainable hydrogen economy.},

An optical measuring system, based on detection of light reflected by the suspended particles, has been developed to measure local solids concentration and local axial solids velocity in dense gas-solid two phase flows. This system has been applied to study hydrodynamics of a cold-flow circulating fluidized bed unit operated in the dense flow regime (uD: 7.5–15 m s-1 and Gs = 100-400 kg m-2 s-). With increasing solids mass flux, at constant superficial gas velocity, lateral solids segregation became more pronounced (i.e. extent of development of core-annulus structure) while the radial profiles of axial solids velocity hardly changed. A decrease in superficial gas velocity, at constant solids mass flux, also augmented the lateral solids segregation. The axial solids velocity decreased over the entire tube radius, although the shape of the profiles showed no strong dependence with respect to the superficial gas velocity. Average solids mass fluxes calculated from the measured local values of solids concentration and solids velocity exceeded the imposed solids mass flux, a finding which could be explained by the downflow observed visually of solid particles close to the tube wall. In addition, cross-sectional averaged solids concentrations obtained on the basis of the optical measuring system and those obtained from the pressure gradient measurements showed satisfactory agreement.},

Calculated results have been compared with experimental data obtained from a small scale CFB unit which could be operated at pressures up to 6 bar. Despite the simplicity of the model, it turned out that the model was capable of predicting the effect of changes in operating conditions (i.e. gas velocity, solids mass flux, operating pressure and particle diameter). The model neglects the existence of clustering of particles, lateral solids segregation and solids downflow near the tube wall, which limits the applicability to dilute systems (ϵs{$<$}0.04).},

As a first approximation gas phase turbulence has been incorporated in our hydrodynamic model by applying a slightly modified version of the well-known Prandtl mixing length model. To solve the resulting set or transport equations, the solids distribution along the tube radius is required. Several strategies are given to obtain this information. In addition the effect of clusters on the momentum transfer between both phases has been modelled using an empirical correlation.

  abstract      = {The investigation of a two-phase flow in porous media has significant implications for a wide range of applications. Previous research has focused on exploring the variations in flow and phase fields in a two-phase flow using experimental and numerical methods. However, the complex structure of porous media introduces many uncertainties that can impact research outcomes. In recent years, some scholars have tried to study the dynamic mechanics of a two-phase flow through typical structures to eliminate these confounding factors. Therefore, this paper focuses on examining the flow patterns of dispersed phases with different sizes during the displacement process based on the typical micro-channel of porous media. Furthermore, the study examines various dimensionless parameters that impact alterations in the streamlines of a two-phase flow as well as the carrying capacity for dispersed phases. The findings suggest that the capillary number governs the ability of the continuous phase to transport the droplet. Consequently, the dispersed droplets tend to become trapped in weak flow regions. The dynamic mechanisms of the dispersive droplet trapping are systematically analyzed by combining the numerical simulation results and experimental evidence from previous studies. Based on these findings, the paper puts forth some mechanistic suggestions that could contribute to a more effective displacement of a two-phase flow in porous media.},

  abstract      = {Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the refinery process for the conversion of high molecularweight hydrocarbons to produce higher valuable products such as gasoline. The optimization of FCC process is challenging due to the complex interactions between a large number of dependent and independent parameters. One of the most uncertain aspects of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit is the description of fluid-solid mixing at the riser entrance. Most of the existing models assume an instant mixing of solids and gaseous reactants. However, a finite mixing length at the bottom of the riser may have a pronounced effect on the FCC operation, particularly, when very short residence times are allowed in the current commercial FCC risers. A good solid-fluid mixing is essential to ensure a complete feed vaporization which is important for several reasons including assuring a thorough catalyst to oil contact and minimizing coke deposition. In this study, the Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow and the 3-lump kinetic models were used to simulate the hydrodynamics and cracking reactions occurring in the FCC riser reactors. The model demonstrated the capability of commercial CFD code FLUENT 6.2 to describe the flow field in the riser reactor. The model also takes into account the temperature, the heat of reactions and gasoline distribution along the riser height.},

Several case studies (ozone decomposition, silane/tetrachlorosilane pyrolysis, methane combustion, and coal gasification) are presented which demonstrate the current capabilities, using the NETL developed code MFIX. For the ozone studies, thermal effects are unimportant; the ozone is only present in small amounts. Also, mixing effects are not addressed since the ozone was premixed with the fluidization air. For methane combustion, the chemical reactions are all in the gas phase although heat transfer to the granular phase is important; again the reactants are premixed in the plenum. For coal gasification, the solids must be mixed with the fluidizing air; many heterogeneous reactions are also included. Complicated chemical schemes are required to describe these processes; the heat release is accounted for, as is the effect on fluidization of gas released by the chemical conversion.},

  abstract      = {Chemical looping (CL) has emerged as a promising approach in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, offering an opportunity for significant reductions in emissions and energy consumption in the ethylene and propylene production industry. While high olefin yields are achievable via CL, the material requirements (e.g., electronic and geometric structures) that prevent the total conversion of alkanes to COx are not clearly understood. This review aims to give a concise understanding of the nucleophilic oxygen species involved in the selective reaction pathways for olefin production as well as of the electrophilic oxygen species that promote an overoxidation to COx products. It further introduces advanced characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, which have been employed successfully in identifying such reactive oxygen species. To mitigate COx formation and enhance olefin selectivity, material engineering solutions are discussed. Common techniques include doping of the bulk or surface and the deposition of functional coatings. In the context of energy consumption and CO2 intensity, techno-economic assessments of CL-ODH systems have predicted energy savings of up to 80\% compared to established olefin production processes such as steam cracking or dehydrogenation. Finally, although their practical application has been limited to date, the potential advantages of the use of fluidized bed reactors in CL-ODH are presented.},

  abstract      = {The increasing rate of food waste (FW) generation around the world is a growing environmental concern, notwithstanding, its valorisation through anaerobic digestion (AD) makes it a potential resource. Moreover, there is a growing demand to optimise the biomethane from AD for gas-to-grid (GtG) and vehicular applications. This has spurred researches on hydrogen gas (H2) injection into AD systems to enhance the biological conversion of H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), a process known as biomethanation. A simplistic approach for biomethanation is to add H2 directly into working AD reactors (in situ biomethanation). However, a competition for the injected H2 towards other biological reactions besides H2/CO2 conversion to CH4 could follow, thus, reducing the efficiency of the system. Hence, this study was conducted to understand how different H2 injection points would affect H2/CO2 conversion to CH4 during FW in situ biomethanation, to identify an optimal injection point. Experiments were designed using H2 equivalent to 5\% of the head-space of the AD reactor at three injection points representing different stages of AD: before volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation, during VFA accumulation and at depleted VFA intermediates. Lower potential for competitive H2 consumption before the accumulation of VFA enabled a high H2/CO2 conversion to CH4. However, enhanced competition for soluble substrates during VFA accumulation reduced the efficiency of H2/CO2 conversion to CH4 when H2 was added at this stage. In general, 12\%, 4\% and 10\% CH4 increases as well as 39\%, 25\% and 34\% CO2 removal were obtained for H2 added before VFA accumulation, during VFA accumulation and at depleted VFA intermediates, respectively. For immediate integration of biomethanation with existing AD facilities, it is suggested that the required H2 be obtained biologically by dark fermentation.},

The coatings reduced weight loss and maintained firmness, in addition to delaying changes in fruit color during storage.

They also significantly reduced the severity of decay caused by inoculation with Botrytis cinerea or Rhizopus stolonifer. The coatings altered the volatile profile of the fruits during storage, decreasing aldehyde and alcohol concentrations and increasing ester concentrations.

  abstract      = {A new model is presented for numerical simulations of collisional transfer of mass, momentum and energy in gas/liquid/solid fluidized beds. The mathematical formulation uses a collision model similar to that of Bhatnagar, Gross, and Krook (BGK), in a particle distribution function transport equation, in order to approximate the rates at which collisions bring about local equilibration of particle velocities and the masses, compositions, and temperatures of liquid films on bed particles. The model is implemented in the framework of the computational-particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) numerical methodology, in which the particle phase is represented with computational parcels and the continuous phase is calculated on Eulerian finite-difference grid. Computational examples using the Barracuda᭨ code, a commercial CFD code owned by CPFD Software, LLC, show the ability of the model to calculate spray injection and subsequent liquid spreading in gas/solid flows.},

  abstract      = {Food losses (FL) and waste (FW) occur throughout the food supply chain. These residues are disposed of on landfills producing environmental issues due to pollutants released into the air, water, and soil. Several research efforts have focused on upgrading FL and FW in a portfolio of added-value products and energy vectors. Among the most relevant research advances, biotechnological upgrading of these residues via fermentation has been demonstrated to be a potential valorization alternative. Despite the multiple investigations performed on the conversion of FL and FW, a lack of comprehensive and systematic literature reviews evaluating the potential of fermentative processes to upgrade different food residues has been identified. Therefore, this article reviews the use of FL and FW in fermentative processes considering the composition, operating conditions, platforms, fermentation product application, and restrictions. This review provides the framework of food residue fermentation based on reported applications, experimental, and theoretical data. Moreover, this review provides future research ideas based on the analyzed information. Thus, potential applications and restrictions of the FL and FW used for fermentative processes are highlighted. In the end, food residues fermentation must be considered a mandatory step toward waste minimization, a circular economy, and the development of more sustainable production and consumption patterns.},

The drag force increased with an increase in the volumetric gas flux as well as with an increase in the particle diameter.

Different design parameters were checked to validate the stability of the reactor. 8 reactions were taken into consideration for the simulation of gasification. A mixture of pure oxygen, water vapor, and nitrogen entering through the bottom of the distributor was used as the gasifying agent. The coal sample was fed from the side wall of the reactor 20\,cm above the gas distributor. Three Australian coal samples having different compositions were simulated using CFD simulation and results were validated to justify the modeling of the reactor. The effect of the oxygen-to-carbon ratio on coal gasification was studied to get the maximum yield of synthesis gas. The cold gas efficiency of the reactor was found to be within 45–60\% which was agreeing well with the literature data. The carbon conversion was also found to be between 40 and 50\%. The yield of synthesis gas was measured and the mass fraction of outlet gases was calculated through simulation. These results imply that the gasifier modeling is satisfactory. Thus, it can be concluded that the CFD-modeled reactor can be used as a base design for an industrial gasifier.},

Rev. Fluids 6, 2021, p. 034402) reveals a detached class of bursting dynamics at Re=40Re=40Re=40 which merge with the low-dissipation dynamics as ReReRe is increased to 100100100 and provides an efficient representation within which to find unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) using recurrent flow analysis. Focusing on initial guesses with energy in higher latent Fourier wavenumbers allows a significant number of high-dissipation-rate UPOs associated with the bursting events to be found for the first time. At Re=400Re=400Re=400, the UPOs discovered at lower ReReRe move away from the attractor, and an entirely different embedding structure is formed within the network devoid of small-scale vortices. Here latent Fourier projections identify an associated `large-scale' UPO which we believe to be a finite-ReReRe continuation of a solution to the Euler equations.},

  abstract      = {Hybrid modeling has gained substantial recognition due to its capacity to seamlessly integrate machine learning methodologies while preserving the fundamental physical principles inherent in a model. Although these hybrid models have predominantly been applied to temporal processes governed by ordinary differential equations, the intricacies of various real-world systems, characterized by a diverse array of physical processes, extend far beyond this domain. This study extensively investigates the application of hybrid modeling techniques within the context of a complex biological system regulated by the reaction–diffusion equation, a specific type of partial differential equation. The primary objective is to tackle the challenges associated with latent chemical mechanisms that are concealed from direct observation. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid modeling framework that synergizes neural networks with mathematical methods to estimate parameters exhibiting spatiotemporal variations within a category of problems involving dynamic boundaries. Model training is executed through a back-propagation algorithm, adept at efficiently updating these parameters while ensuring numerical stability. Subsequently, the hybrid model is employed in the context of reaction–diffusion models, yielding results that validate its proficiency in precisely estimating variable diffusivity across both space and time as well as temporal fluctuations in cell proliferation rates and cell carrying density. The mean squared error of the final output predictions by the hybrid model is 9.4 \texttimes{} 10–6 as compared to that of a simple first-principles model which is 3.12 \texttimes{} 10–4.},

  abstract      = {Relating pressure fluctuations to the various flow regimes in dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems and exploring the effects of the variations of a number of intrinsic flow parameters through the analysis of complex pressure signals are of importance. To explore the pressure fluctuations, a series of experiments were conducted by monitoring the pressure drop and its fluctuations in horizontal and vertical pipe sections of an experimental conveying rig of industrial relevance. Observed pressure signals contained not only the effects of flow rates of conveyed polymeric solid particles and the conveying air, but also the effects of the pipe orientation, solids feeder, and the air blower employed. Time series of the observed pressure signals were analyzed in order to obtain information about the relations based on four different analysis techniques: power spectral density (PSD) analysis, phase space diagram, rescaled range analysis, and wavelet analysis. The sampling frequency of the study was determined through the application of the PSD analysis. Variations in gas and particle flow rates were found that could be traced by the locations of the dominant peaks on the frequency axis of spectrum plots generated from the PSD analysis. Additionally, the level of multiplicity of such dominant PSD peaks pointed to the differences in the flow behavior between the interconnected vertical and horizontal pipe sections. Variations in the Hurst's exponent of the rescaled range analysis technique with the solids loading ratios were found relatable to the observed flow regimes prevailing in the pneumatic conveying system studied. Eccentricity ratios and the number of attractors of the phase space diagrams provided further information about the effects of the changes in solids loading ratios on the flow behavior and the flow mode, respectively. The wavelet analysis, through its detailed signals at different scale levels, helped to give information from the pressure fluctuations. Unique frequencies were determined that corresponded to certain flow behaviors and devices, gas-particle interactions, the mechanical blower, and feeder units. This finding enabled the investigation of the intrinsic flow behavior by filtering out the signals caused by such mechanical devices.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a novel technique for particle tracking in 2-dimensional fluidized beds operated under ambient conditions. The method is applied to study the mixing mechanisms of fuel particles in fluidized beds and is based on tracking a phosphorescent tracer particle by means of video recording with subsequent digital image analysis. From this, concentration, velocity and dispersion fields of the tracer particle can be obtained with high accuracy. Although the method is restricted to 2-dimensional, it can be applied under flow conditions qualitatively resembling a fluidized-bed combustor. Thus, the experiments cover ranges of bed heights, gas velocities and fuel-to-bed material density and size ratios typical for fluidized-bed combustors. Also, several fluidization regimes (bubbling, turbulent, circulating and pneumatic) are included in the runs. A pattern found in all runs is that the mixing pattern of the tracer (fuel) solids is structured in horizontally aligned vortexes induced by the bubble flow. The main bubble paths always give a low concentration of tracer solids and with the tracer moving upwards, while the downflow of tracer particles in the dense bottom bed is found to take place in zones with low bubble density and at the sidewalls. The amount of bed material (bed height) has a strong influence on the bottom bed dynamics (development and coalescence of bubbles) and, consequently, on the solids mixing process. Local dispersion coefficients reach maximum values around the locations of bubble eruptions, while, in the presence of a dense bottom bed, an increase in fluidization velocity or amount of bed material enhances dispersion. Dispersion is found to be larger in the vertical than in the horizontal direction, confirming the critical character of lateral fuel dispersion in fluidized-bed combustors of large cross section.},

The paper summarizes the main basis and assumptions for each model together with major advantages and drawbacks. In addition, a practical example on how a selected set of these local models can be linked to an overall model of the fluid dynamics of the entire CFB loop is presented.

We review the key research trends and application scenarios in the emerging field of integrating simulations, machine learning, and statistics. We highlight the opportunities that such an integrated vision can unlock and outline the key challenges holding back its realisation.

Since fluid behavior is quite erratic, a single algorithm may not be versatile in every case. In some cases, multiple algorithms are combined for successful simulations. The uniqueness of the review lies in the combination of algorithms for every different case with theoretical analysis and disadvantages, which could be avoided by clubbing another algorithm that overcomes the problem. Since ML is not fully mature yet to provide high accuracy without bit preprocessing in the form of the numerical method, this is one of the heavy limitations that are briefly discussed.},

  abstract      = {Droplet size distribution (DSD) is one of the key quality attributes of liquid–liquid emulsions. Various fluidic devices are used to generate emulsions. Most of the currently available models for estimating DSD are complicated to implement and computationally expensive. In this work, we have developed a simplified drop breakage model that is easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. This model approximates DSDs in three droplet populations, each characterised by a mean diameter. The developed drop breakage model was applied to simulate Sauter mean diameters of oil-in-water emulsions generated using three fluidic devices covering a broad range of shear rates and droplet sizes namely: vortex-based cavitation device (VD), helical coil (HC), and fluidic oscillator (FO). The variation of DSD with the number of passes (np) through the emulsion-producing fluidic devices was measured experimentally. The Sauter mean diameter (d32) and number of droplets (n) in each population were estimated from the measured DSD data. The procedure to estimate model parameters is presented. The simplified breakage model presented here was able to simulate the influence of the number of passes and operating conditions on Sauter mean diameter as well as breakage efficiency. VD was found to exhibit the highest drop breakage efficiency. FO was found to be a preferred choice for low ({$<$} 20\,J/kg) energy consumption, HC for the middle range (20 – 100\,J/kg) and VD for the higher ({\$>\$} 100\,J/kg) range of energy consumption. The developed approach and model provide a simplified way of simulating the Sauter mean diameters of emulsions for a variety of emulsion-generating devices.},

  abstract      = {Crystallization is an important separation unit operation accounting for nearly 90\% of organic molecules in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Recently, continuous crystallization was demonstrated to have several advantages over the conventional batch crystallization in terms of improved product consistency, reduced labor costs/economic footprint, and better process control. Continuous stirred tank crystallizers, however, are limited in mixing/heat transfer capabilities and have issues like cyclical oscillations in product quality. Tubular crystallizers can mitigate these issues and, however, suffer from issues related to particle settling and blockages. Fluidic oscillators with one or more feedback channels are gaining popularity in recent years due to the advent of microfluidics. Jet oscillations in fluidic oscillators were shown to consistently provide vigorous mixing and heat transfer above a critical Reynold's number. In the present study, the feasibility of the fluidic oscillator as a continuous crystallizer was evaluated to mitigate challenges faced by previous continuous crystallization technologies. A novel ``loop setup'' was proposed for continuous crystallization and was investigated using the seeded antisolvent crystallization of paracetamol in a methanol-water system. The effects of key operating conditions of residence time, supersaturation ratio, operational mode, fluidic device, device orientation, and seed size were investigated. Throughout the study, it was observed that the loop setup gave product particle size distributions consistent with enhanced mixing behavior. Further, it was demonstrated that the proposed continuous crystallizer was better in terms of scale up in comparison with batch crystallizers. The presented results and approach will be useful to develop fluidic oscillators as a useful platform for continuous crystallization.},

Fluorescein loaded giant 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid vesicles were treated with hydrodynamic cavitation as promising method in inactivation of biological samples. Hydrodynamic treatment was compared to various chemical, physical and mechanical stressors such as ionic strength and osmolarity agents (glucose, Na+, Ca2+, and Fe3+), free radicals, shear stresses (pipetting, vortex mixing, rotational shear stress), high pressure, electroporation, centrifugation, surface active agents (Triton X-100, ethanol), microwave irradiation, heating, freezing-thawing, ultrasound (ultrasonic bath, sonotrode). The fluorescence intensity of individual fluorescein loaded lipid vesicles was measured with confocal laser microscopy. The distribution of lipid vesicle size, vesicle fluorescence intensity, and the number of fluorescein loaded vesicles was determined before and after treatment with different stressors. The different environmental stressors were ranked in order of their relative effect on liposome fluorescein release. Of all tested chemical, physical and mechanical treatments for stability of lipid vesicles, the most detrimental effect on vesicles stability had hydrodynamic cavitation, vortex mixing with glass beads and ultrasound. Here we showed, for the first time that hydrodynamic cavitation was among the most effective physico-chemical treatments in destroying lipid vesicles. This work provides a benchmark for lipid vesicle robustness to a variety of different physico-chemical and mechanical parameters important in lipid vesicle preparation and application.},

In this work, we present a short course that was developed and rolled-out using the Clapeyron.jl package, the material of which is all openly available on GitHub. The course can serve as a foundation for others to similarly integrate computational material in thermodynamics education. The course is structured into three sections. Section one serves as a refresher and covers core material in numerical methods and thermodynamics. Section two introduces a range of thermodynamic models such as activity-coefficient models and cubic equations of state, outlining their implementation. In section three the focus is moved to deployment, guiding students on how to implement computational-thermodynamics methods covering volume solvers, saturation solvers, chemical-stability analysis and flash problems. In a pilot study conducted with both undergraduate and graduate students, participants found the material engaging and highly relevant to their chemical-engineering education.},

The heats of cracking reactions were estimated by taking the macroscopic difference of enthalpies of products and reactants along the length of the riser. A model has also been developed to calculate the heat transfer mixing height in the riser to verify the assumption of instant thermal equilibrium between the feed and the catalyst. The models were incorporated in CATCRAK [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 34 (1995) 3737] and temperature and conversion profiles within the riser were obtained. A temperature drop of about 30–40 ◦C (typical of commercial applications) was predicted. The model can be used in finding optimum temperature schemes for the existing FCC systems as well as to suggest an optimum riser length for new systems to improve gasoline yields.},

  abstract      = {The undesired phenomenon of partial or complete defluidizing can occur in industrial applications involving fluidized beds. That could be prevented by increasing the gas velocity, provided an adequate observation of changes in the hydrodynamic of the fluidized bed is detected early enough. Since the value of gas velocity on defluidization of bed is near the gas velocity at minimum fluidization condition, it is very important to use a methodology that can promptly detect the minimum fluidization velocity region, so that shutting down the process can be avoided. The literature shows that the methods to detect the region of such a velocity are limited, and in practice, the traditional method for determination of minimum fluidization velocity (pressure drop across the bed versus superficial gas velocity) is still the most used. In the present work, a methodology is proposed to detect the region where the minimum velocity takes place in a gas–solid fluidized bed, based on the spectral analysis of pressure fluctuation measurements using a Gaussian distribution curve. Results indicate that the method is satisfactory, and it could be used as a more practical indicator of the region where the defluidization phenomenon occurs.},

The hydrogenation of dibenzyltoluene was experimentally performed at various temperature and pressure conditions with commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at a batch reactor. It showed that the reaction rate increased with increasing temperature and pressure. Analysis of the concentrations of dibenzyltoluene (H0-DBT) and hydrogenated forms (H6-DBT, H12-DBT, H18-DBT) using GC–MS showed that the concentrations were only a function of DoH (Degree of Hydrogenation) regardless of temperature and pressure. Based on the experimental observations, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model is applied with the assumptions that the hydrogenation reaction occurs sequentially up to fully hydrogenated form and the surface irreversible reaction is a rate determining step following assumptions. 1. Hydrogenation occurs sequentially. 2. Surface reaction was irreversible rate determining step. 3. Hydrogen adsorption behavior is non-competitive. The small adsorption constant of H12-DBT explained that H12-DBT was accumulated by H0-DBT and H6-DBT. Consequently, the hydrogenation of dibenzyltoluene is important for the adsorption behavior of the reactants on the catalyst surface. Dibenzyltoluene hydrogenation was calculated by using regression equations as a function of DoH and a kinetic model. Calculation result has an error within 20\% in most of degree of hydrogenation. In particular, the simulation has a less than 10\% error high accuracy at above of 70\% degree of hydrogenation or more than 60~bar. Consequently, the final model approximates the actual behavior of dibenzyltoluene hydrogenation over a wide range of temperature (130–170~\textdegree{}C) and pressure (40–80~bar).},

  abstract      = {In the iron and steel-making process, direct reduced iron (DRI) is the very first step that uses CO and H2 to reduce iron ore and therefore contributes to fewer CO2 emissions than the conventional blast furnace process. The CO and H2 required for the DRI process are generated from bottom-fired reformers with reformer tubes filled with catalyst particles and transported to the shaft furnace for iron-ore reduction. Therefore, the DRI reforming process plays an essential role in DRI production by supplying reducing gases of the desired composition, flow rate, and temperature. In the present work, a 3D computational fluid dynamics model is developed to simulate the industrial-scale DRI reforming process that includes the multicomponent gas mixture flow in reactor tubes and burners, heat transfer from burner to tubes due to combustion on the burner side, and reforming reactions in catalyst-filled tubes. The pressure drop on the tube side due to the presence of the catalyst is calculated through a porous media approach. Results show the formation of a long and narrow flame on the burner side due to combustion, which led to an increase in the temperature of the tube wall and at the tube center. This enabled endothermic reforming reactions on the tube side and resulted in the consumption of CH4 and H2O and the formation of CO and H2. The model predictions of tube outlet reformed gas temperature and composition and the temperature at different axial locations at the tube wall and center are in satisfactory agreement with ArcelorMittal's plant data.},

  abstract      = {Ironmaking through direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) using CO and/or H2 significantly reduces CO2 emissions in comparison to the traditional blast furnace route which uses coke. Fluidized bed DRI due to direct utilization of fine ore eliminates the firing/induration and cooling steps in the pelletization process used in shaft furnace DRI and blast furnace and thus has the potential to become an energy-efficient carbon neutral technology with cost competitive to shaft furnace DRI. In this paper, the commercial fluidized bed-based fine iron ore reduction technologies (FINEX, FINMET, FIOR, CIRCORED, NU-IRON, H-IRON, and IRON-CARBIDE) are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of the technologies are summarized, and the process conditions, energy consumptions, and DRI properties are compared. Additionally, the challenges associated with fluidizing and reducing the most widely available ultrafine ore in commercial fluidized bed technologies are addressed.},

The apparatus consisted of a downer fluidized bed, 13 cm I.D. and 4.75 m tall, and a riser fluidized bed, 3.8 cm I.D. and 5.15 m in height. The lactic acid production and removal was carried out in the downer, while the riser was used for the recovery of lactic acid. A continuously recirculating bed of ion-exchange resin was used for adsorption of the produced acid as well as for maintaining optimum pH for bioconversion, thus eliminating the need for costly and complex chemical control approach used in conventional techniques. Studies using lactic acid aqueous solution as feed and sodium hydroxide solution as regeneration stream showed 93\% lactic acid removal from the downer and 46\% recovery in the riser under the conditions investigated. Such results prove the functionality of using the newly developed bioreactor design for the continuous production and recovery of products of biotechnological significance.},

  abstract      = {Phase distribution is one of the key hydrodynamic parameters useful for the design and performance assessment of fluidized bed dryers (FBDs). It has direct influence on the drying rate, thermal efficiency, residence time distribution and degree of mixing. The quality of fluidization strongly depends on the uniformity of distribution of the fluidizing gas and the physical properties of the material to be fluidized. In the present work, gamma ray tomography (GRT) study was carried out in the form of chordal solid hold-up, which was found to be greatly influenced by the gas distributor design. The performance of a gas distributor due to the prevalent practice of operating at lower values of distributor-to-bed pressure drop ratio was characterized in a 0.15 m diameter fluidized bed dryer over a broad range of superficial gas velocity. The effects of various parameters such as solids loading, particle size and particle density were analyzed with the help of the reconstructed solid hold-up profiles. The fluidization was studied in terms of maldistribution factor (\ensuremath{\chi}), a value of 5\% or less can be obtained by properly designing distributor for a given bed loading, particularly for batch fluidized bed dryers. An industrial size fluidized bed dryer of 1 m diameter was also examined tomographically to obtain quantitative information on the solid hold-up distribution within the bed.},

The impulse experiments show that gas passes through the riser at velocities significantly greater than superficial gas velocities. A core-annular flow model was used to describe the hydrodynamics. Axial dispersion in the core zone is negligible and mass transfer to the denser, stagnant annulus is characterized by a cross-flow coefficient, k. The Gilliland-Sherwood equation for wetted wall towers, modified to account for the increase in mass transfer rate introduced by the solids, correlates the data reasonably well: The ratio of the cross-sectional area of the lean core to riser cross-sectional area, \ensuremath{\Phi}g, decreases with solids mass flux but increases with gas velocity. Based on a number of experimental investigations, the effects of riser diameter and particle characteristics on \ensuremath{\Phi}g were qualified and the data were fit with a simple two parameter model: This relationship adequately predicts gas bypassing in risers from 0.05 to 0.94 m in diameter.},

  abstract      = {In the Eulerian approach to model gas–solid fluidized beds closures are required for the internal momentum transfer in the particulate phase. Firstly, two closure models, one semi-empirical model assuming a constant viscosity of the solid phase (CVM) and a second model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF), have been compared in this part in their performance to describe bubble formation at a single orifice and the time-averaged porosity profiles in the bed using experimental data obtained for a pseudo two-dimensional fluidized bed operated with a jet in the center. Numerical simulations have shown that bubble growth at a nozzle with a jet is mainly determined by the drag experienced by the gas percolating through the compaction region around the bubble interface, which is not much influenced by particle–particle interactions, so that the KTGF and CVM give very similar predictions. However, this KTGF model does not account for the long term and multi particle–particle contacts (frictional stresses) and under-predicts the solid phase viscosity at the wall as well as around the bubble and therefore over-predicts the bed expansion. Therefore, in the later part of the paper, the bubble growth at a single orifice and the time-averaged porosity distribution in the bed predicted by the KTGF model with and without frictional stresses are compared with experimental data. The model predictions by the KTGF are improved significantly by the incorporation of frictional stresses, which are however strongly influenced by the empirical parameters in this model. In Part II the comparison of the CVM and KTGF with experimental results is extended to freely bubbling fluidized beds.},

Pilot plant studies (capacity, 1~m3/h) on synthetic wastewater using 4-amino phenol as model nitrogen containing organic compound and two real industrial effluents of high ammoniacal nitrogen content were carried out using hydrodynamic cavitation. Two reactor geometries were evaluated for increased efficiency in removal-orifice and vortex diode. Effect of initial concentration (100–500~mg/L), effect of pressure drop (0.5–5~bar) and nature of cavitating device (linear and vortex flow for cavitation) were evaluated along with effect of salt content, effect of hydrogen peroxide addition and aeration. Initial concentration was found to have significant impact on the extent of removal: \textasciitilde{} 5~g/m3 removal for initial concentration of 100~mg/L and up to 12~g/m3 removal at high concentration of 500~mg/L. Interestingly, significant improvement of the order of magnitude (up to 8 times) in removal of ammoniacal nitrogen could be obtained by sparging air or oxygen in hydrodynamic cavitation and a very high removal of above 80\% could be achieved. The removal of ammoniacal nitrogen by vortex diode was also found to be effective in the industrial wastewaters and results on two different effluent samples of distillery industry indicated up to 75\% removal, though with longer time of treatment compared to that of synthetic wastewater. The developed methodology of hydrodynamic cavitation technology with aeration and vortex diode as a cavitating device was found to be highly effective for improving the efficiency of the conventional cavitation methods and hence can be highly useful in industrial wastewater treatment, specifically for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen.},

  abstract      = {A new approach of solvent-assisted cavitation process was proposed for degradation of organic pollutants. The process envisages the use of suitable solvent as an additive, (1–5\% v/V), in the conventional cavitation process to enhance the pollutant removal efficiency. A proof of concept was provided for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen with significantly improved efficiency using solvent-assisted hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) compared to conventional HC. The efficacy of the process was studied on a pilot plant scale (1~m3/h) and using vortex flow based vortex diode as a cavitating device. Degradation studies were carried out using a model pollutant, 4-aminophenol and four different solvents as additives, 1-octanol, cyclohexanol, 1-octane and toluene. Relatively polar solvents were found to increase the efficiency of the pollutant removal ({$>$}65\%) and also increase the rates to an extent of more than 200\%, compared to only HC. A very high removal of ammoniacal nitrogen, more than 90\%, was obtained for solvents 1-octanol and cyclohexanol, indicating the importance of the selection of solvent. Per-pass degradation model showed 3 to 4 times increase in the per pass degradation for polar solvents compared to cavitation alone. The results confirm no role of conventional solvent extraction and no specific contamination of wastewater due to the use of solvent as an additive in the process. Further, the cost was 2–3 times lower as compared to the conventional HC. The interesting observations in the proposed process can fuel further research to provide possible improvements in existing methodologies of wastewater treatment, in general, and for removal of ammoniacal nitrogen, in particular.},

  abstract      = {Biomass liquefaction can enhance corn-stover slurry transportation by reducing yield stress and overall viscosity, easing biomass handling, especially for slurries at high solids loading (\geq{}30~\% (w/v). Implementing a liquefaction process at the front-end of the biorefinery could reduce downtime caused by equipment fouling. Furthermore, liquefaction reduces process complexity by transforming high fiber mass into a pumpable slurry. Three scenarios for liquefaction of corn stover pellets: enzyme process, enzyme mimetic process, and a combined process of enzyme and enzyme mimetic were assessed. The ideal process will have the best performance-to-cost ratio, with minimal impact on the environment. Techno-economic and life-cycle analyses were used to understand the economic and environmental effects of the three liquefaction scenarios and to determine if one or more can achieve cost parity. Results show that the enzyme process had the best performance in terms of cost and emissions (gCO2-equivalent/kg slurry) compared to the other scenarios.},

  abstract      = {Reuse of appropriately treated greywater can be extensive solution to aid the overburdened water resources. The present work investigates the treatment of domestic greywater using HC, Fenton and hybrid HC + Fenton techniques. Operating parameters such as treatment time, inlet pressure, initial pH, Fe2+/H2O2 ratio etc. were optimized for individual HC and Fenton processes. Hybrid greywater treatment using HC + Fenton was performed at optimum operating conditions of pH: 4, Inlet Pressure: 4bar, Fe2+/H2O2 Ratio- 1:10, treatment time: 1h. Degradation efficiency of all the techniques was analyzed as COD removal. HC, Fenton and hybrid HC + Fenton techniques showed COD degradation of 53.5, 59.1 and 92.8\% respectively in 60min. Rate constants for HC, Fenton and hybrid HC + Fenton were 11.2\texttimes{}10-3, 12.7 \texttimes{}10-3, 36.5\texttimes{}10-3min-1 respectively. The hybrid approach used to clean greywater showed very little evidence of bacterial colony formation. Hybrid greywater treatment meets the need for reusing water for irrigation and domestic purpose. With a synergy rating of 1.5, hybrid technique is more effective than individual procedures. It was determined that the hybrid approach would cost 248.02 USD/m3 to treat the greywater that has undergone hybrid treatment meets criteria for reuse and can be used in non-potable tasks. Hence, this work shows that hybrid HC + Fenton technique can be used for effective treatment to treat greywater.},

  abstract      = {Clean hydrogen can help mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while accommodating the projected increase in global energy demand. Methane pyrolysis is a technology that can produce low-cost, low-emission hydrogenIn the absence of oxygen, this process can use endothermic reactions that split C–H bonds to produce gaseous hydrogen and solid carbon. Thermodynamically, methane pyrolysis produces a lower amount of GHG emissions compared to steam methane reforming (SMR)and it requires high temperatures (800–1600~\textdegree{}C) to overcome activation energy barriers. The methods used to overcome operational challenges, while improving thermal efficiency, include using solid catalysts, molten metals and molten salts. This study evaluates recent developments in methane pyrolysis technologies, including their advantages, limitations, and development status. Specifically, alternative energy transfer methods (e.g., microwave, plasma, induction, shockwave, radiation heating), reactor designs (e.g., bubble column, plug, fluidized-bed, packed-bed, pulse tube, tubular, fluid wall, honeycomb monolith and moving carbon-bed) and combinations of two or more technologies are analyzed and compared. This work discusses the commercialization challenges to achieve high-purity hydrogen and solid carbon with facile separation methods. The analysis indicates that the most prominent barriers to methane pyrolysis are trelated to the challenges under high-temperature and high-pressure operation, as well as corrosive reaction environments. These challenges will require additional research and investment in reactor design and fabrication solutions. .},

  abstract      = {Growing global population has given rise to an increased demand for protein, putting pressure on traditional animal-based protein sources, questioning their sustainability and impact on environment. As a result, alternative protein sources are being explored to provide more sustainable and environmentally friendly options to meet global nutritional demands. Among all, green leaf biomass (GLB), being the largest biomass source, is a major potential alternative protein source. Till now, leaf protein extraction involved concentrating the pressed juice into leaf protein concentrate (LPC) and extracting protein from LPC.  This study investigates using hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) combined with alkaline extraction and acid precipitation to recover proteins, particularly RuBisCo, from GLB. HC works on cavitation phenomenon where localized high-energy microbubbles are generated due to sudden drop in local pressure when liquid flows through a constricted area, which collapse violently, generating intense shear forces capable of breaking down cell structures. Although HC has been widely applied in lignocellulose pretreatment and protein extraction from seeds, its efficacy in breaking down the complex lignocellulosic matrix of GLB to release intracellular proteins is underexplored. The research was conducted using a design of experiments (DoE) approach to systematically evaluate the influence of key experimental variables such as orifice restriction (80–90\%), alkali strength (50–150 mM), and temperature (20–60\textdegree{}C) on protein yield. Dried Jerusalem artichoke leaves (JAL) were used for protein extraction using HC under varying experimental conditions. The experimental workflow involved JAL pretreatment by grinding, followed by HC treatment with a 1:25 w/v solids-to-solvent ratio using 3L of NaOH and protein solubilization by alkaline extraction, acid precipitation at pH 3.5, and lyophilization to recover the actual dried protein. Each steps were carefully monitored to quantify and evaluate the extracted proteins.  Results demonstrated that while HC effectively disrupted biomass and reduced particle size, it did not fully break down intracellular organelles for complete protein release. Protein yields (g protein/ g DS) were significantly influenced by the interaction of alkali strength and orifice restriction, with 50 mM NaOH and moderate orifice restriction (80 \%) yielding highest of 45.9 mg/g and 39.2 mg/g of estimated protein and actual protein, respectively. However, acid precipitation at pH 3.5 was insufficient to recover all solubilized proteins, resulting in substantial protein loss (81.2 \% non-precipitated proteins) with only 15.8 \% of actual protein recovery. Challenges in protein visualization through sodium dodecyl sulfate – Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were encountered, likely due to protein degradation, insufficient solubilization, and interference from secondary metabolites. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) revealed heterogeneous protein fractions, but RuBisCo bands were not distinctly observed, pointing to limitations in both the extraction and recovery process. The findings highlight the need for optimization of HC conditions and suggest that combining HC with other mechanical or enzymatic methods may enhance protein extraction efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Alumina-supported Pd, Au and Au–Pd catalysts were investigated for the simultaneous hydrogenation (HYD) of naphthalene (NP) and toluene (T) in the presence of dibenzothiophene (DBT). The nature of supported Au, its resistance against S-poisoning when applied along with Pd in the hydrogenation of aromatics was studied. Additionally, the effect of two kinds of \ensuremath{\gamma}-alumina (A(N) and A(S)) with different textural properties on the structure and performance of the catalysts was evaluated. Irrespectively of the support used, all the catalysts showed resistance to S-poisoning and their activity followed an order of NP {$>$} T {\$>\$} DBT. For hydrogenation of naphthalene, the specific reaction rates normalized to Pd loading follows trend: Au–Pd/A(N)\gg{}Au–Pd/A(S) {\$>\$} Pd(A(N) {\$>\$} Pd/A(S). The higher activity in the hydrogenation of naphthalene of the separate Au0 and Pd0 phases on a type-N alumina support with respect to those supported on a type-S alumina was related to a more homogeneous dispersion of Pd0 and Au0 crystallites and a lower extent of coke formation. Under an excess of hydrogen, the monometallic gold catalysts did not show any activity in the HYD of toluene. However, the Au catalysts showed over-hydrogenation of NP to decalin, in contrast with the performance of the Pd and Au–Pd samples. This behaviour can be exploited to avoid the over-hydrogenation of naphthalene by using the bimetallic Au–Pd formulation.},

Chemical absorption-based processes are the most mature technology, but process costs should be reduced to facilitate their worldwide application. In this context, we address the optimal design of absorption-based carbon capture technologies using the Aspen Plus platform in the equation-oriented (EO) mode. We show the efficiency of this tool by solving optimal design problems for three case studies: (i) conventional process using monoethanolamine; (ii) conventional process using 2-methylpiperazine; and (iii) advanced flash stripping (AFS) configuration using piperazine (PZ). The objective function is the carbon dioxide avoided cost, and we consider a flue gas with a CO2 concentration of 7.5\% (molar basis). Numerical results indicate that the AFS configuration with PZ has the best energy efficiency (2.46 GJ/t-CO2) and achieves the lowest CO2 avoided cost, with a value of 98.8 \$/tonne-CO2.},

However, the acid leaching mechanisms remain unsolved as they are complicated by complex mineralogy and different test conditions used in previous studies. In this study, bauxite residue and two DSP phases, zeolite Linde Type A (LTA) and sodalite, were leached using aqueous HCl solutions with concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 M. The leaching kinetics of Na, Al, and Si were measured, and solid samples were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-section elemental mapping. The results reveal that DSP neutralization occurs in two stages: Na+–H+ ion exchange and hydrolysis of the Al–O–Si framework (dissolution of DSP). In the ion exchange stage, minimal Al and Si react compared with Na that readily dissolves. During the hydrolysis stage, reacted zeolite LTA converts to an amorphous phase while the sodalite aluminosilicate framework is dissolved.},

The meshless nature and the readily available derivative information of PINN solution opens up new opportunities for modelling the thermally induced distortion in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM). The proposed framework incorporates simple yet effective strategies that enable PINN to overcome the usual shortfall of neural networks (NNs) in dealing with discontinuities. It is a critical step for applying PINN to the multi-layer problem which intrinsically contains discontinuities due to the layer-by-layer nature of DED and other metal AM processes. The accuracy of the proposed framework is validated via a benchmark test against ANSYS simulation. Leveraging the possibility of initialisation with prior knowledge, PINN is also demonstrating potential computational time-savings, especially for larger parts. Furthermore, remarks on strategies to improve ease of training and prediction accuracy by PINN for the particular use case in DED temperature history prediction have been made. The proposed framework sets the foundation for the subsequent exploration of applying scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques to real-life engineering applications.},

Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites, making them an area of interest in the search for new phytochemicals to cope with AMR. A great part of agri-food waste is of plant origin, constituting a promising source of valuable compounds with different bioactivities, including those against antimicrobial resistance. Many types of phytochemicals, such as carotenoids, tocopherols, glucosinolates, and phenolic compounds, are widely present in plant by-products, such as citrus peels, tomato waste, and wine pomace. Unveiling these and other bioactive compounds is therefore very relevant and could be an important and sustainable form of agri-food waste valorisation, adding profit for local economies and mitigating the negative impact of these wastes' decomposition on the environment. This review will focus on the potential of agri-food waste from a plant origin as a source of phytochemicals with antibacterial activity for global health benefits against AMR.},

  abstract      = {With the predicted depletion of natural resources and alarming environmental issues, sustainable development has become a popular as well as a much-needed concept in modern process industries. Hence, manufacturers are quite keen on adopting novel process monitoring techniques to enhance product quality and process efficiency while minimizing possible adverse environmental impacts. Hardware sensors are employed in process industries to aid process monitoring and control, but they are associated with many limitations such as disturbances to the process flow, measurement delays, frequent need for maintenance, and high capital costs. As a result, soft sensors have become an attractive alternative for predicting quality-related parameters that are `hard-to-measure' using hardware sensors. Due to their promising features over hardware counterparts, they have been employed across different process industries. This article attempts to explore the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (Al)-driven soft sensors designed for process industries and their role in achieving the goal of sustainable development. First, a general introduction is given to soft sensors, their applications in different process industries, and their significance in achieving sustainable development goals. AI-based soft sensing algorithms are then introduced. Next, a discussion on how AI-driven soft sensors contribute toward different sustainable manufacturing strategies of process industries is provided. This is followed by a critical review of the most recent state-of-the-art AI-based soft sensors reported in the literature. Here, the use of powerful AI-based algorithms for addressing the limitations of traditional algorithms, that restrict the soft sensor performance is discussed. Finally, the challenges and limitations associated with the current soft sensor design, application, and maintenance aspects are discussed with possible future directions for designing more intelligent and smart soft sensing technologies to cater the future industrial needs.},

In a first step, the optimal reaction route is calculated taking various process intensification concepts into account. The potential of each reaction concept can be efficiently quantified, which is the economic basis for the design of advanced reactors. Based on these results, a promising concept is further investigated and a technical reactor is designed. As an extension to the design method, reactor design criteria for external and internal heat and mass transfer limitations are directly included in the optimization approach in order to design the catalyst packing. The derived reactor concept is investigated with a detailed 2D reactor model accounting for radial concentration and temperature gradients in addition to a radial velocity profile. The example considered in this work is the production of ethylene oxide which is one of the most important bulk chemicals. Due to the high ethylene costs, the selectivity is the main factor for the economics of the process. A membrane reactor with an advanced cooling strategy is proposed as best technical reactor. With this reactor design it is possible to increase the selectivity of the ethylene epoxidation by approximately 3\% compared to an optimized reference case.},

  abstract      = {The prediction of mass transfer rates to and from moving drops has traditionally used the Whitman two-\"{y}lm theory approach in which the resistances to mass transfer on each side of the interface are described by \"{y}lm mass transfer coe cients. These are correlated in terms of the hydrodynamic conditions, the physical properties of the uids, and the geometry of the system. The performance of liquid–liquid contactors in which mass transfer occurs between swarms of moving droplets of one phase and the other liquid phase as the continuous phase, has similarly been correlated in terms of mass transfer coe cients. These lump together the combined e ects of interfacial mass transfer resistances and those associated with the bulk phases, the e ects of interfacial disturbances, coalescence and break-up phenomena, speci\"{y}c surface area, and the e ects of axial mixing. In this paper we build upon earlier work and other published research which uses \"{y}nite element methods to quantitatively calculate ow \"{y}eld data and trajectory predictions for single particles and drops in a two phase system. The di erential equations were discretised using the \"{y}nite element approach employing a procedure based on the Lagrangian framework developed earlier. Here we extend the approach to calculate mass transfer rates between single aqueous drops and a continuous immiscible solvent phase. The calculated values of drop velocity and mass transfer rates are compared with experimental values determined for single drops of ethanol=water mixtures extracting into a continuous phase of n-decanol. Good agreement between the experimental and predicted values was obtained, thus demonstrating that in this case, interfacial mass transfer in liquid–liquid systems can be predicted from the fundamental transport equations. The results of the work indicate the potential of further development of this approach for swarming drops and hence quantitative prediction of the behaviour of liquid–liquid contactors. ? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thus, the optimal use of lignocellulosic residues should ensure a steam supply of 120 tonne/h to the sugar mill, while also optimising the production of H2. Overall process economic costs were evaluated with the minimum selling price of H2 (MSPH). Thus, gasification processes may have produced 2566~kg/h of H2 at the lowest cost of 6.9 US\$/kg, and ADR may have produced 2067~kg/h of H2 at 7.7 US\$/kg from lignocelluloses that underwent steam-explosion. Otherwise, annexing ethanol production could allow an H2 selling price under 5 US\$/kg, if ethanol trades above 1.6 US\$/kg.

  abstract      = {Abstract. The increasing world energy demand has derived in the consumption of conventional sources of energy, leading to a rise in non-conventional resources such as heavy oils (HO). Nevertheless, the HO physicochemical properties such as high viscosity, are related to significant operational issues in production and transport processes. Thus, the main objective of this study is the HO viscosity reduction through a novel cracking reactions method prompted by an ultrasound cavitation technique assisted with nickel oxide nanoparticles functionalized over nanoparticulated silica (SiNi) as catalysts, and water as a hydrogen donor for enhancing the cracking reactions, fomenting the conversion of the crude oil heavy compounds (asphaltenes) into lighter sub-components. An HO with 17.02\% of asphaltenes content was used for carrying out the tests. Along the study, there were identified several viscosity reduction mechanisms related with asphaltenes adsorption onto SiNi nanoparticles surface affecting the fluid internal structure, as well as the reduction of the crude oil asphaltenes content due to its conversion into lighter components. These mechanisms were widely explained by a phenomenological approach through rheological behavior measurements and modeling, which also provide a better understanding of the treatment effect in the HO mobility and an increased transport capacity. The viscosity measurements were realized upon nanoparticles and gasoline addition, and ultrasound cavitation separately. The ultrasound cavitation submission time was evaluated, with better results as the exposure time increased. The effect of nanoparticles concentration was also assessed, obtaining high degrees of viscosity reduction with nanoparticles dosages = 2000 mg/L. After the complete treatment application, an asphaltenes content reduction greater than 15\% was observed with a viscosity reduction degree (VRD) up to 50\% at a fixed shear rate of 20 s-1. This study should open a wider landscape about the use of nanotechnology for improving the production and transport of heavy oils.},

  abstract      = {A computational study of fully-developed flow of gas-particle suspensions in vertical pipes was carried out, using the model proposed recently by Sinclair and Jackson (1989), to understand the predicted scale-up characteristics. It was shown that the model can capture the existence of steady-state multiplicity wherein different pressure gradients can be obtained for the same gas and solids fluxes. A pronounced and nonmonotonic variation of the pressure gradient required to achieve desired fluxes of solid and gas with tube diameter was predicted by the model, and this is explained on a physical basis. The computed results were compared with the experimental data. The model manifests an unsatisfactory degree of sensitivity to the inelasticity of the particle-particle collisions and the damping of particle-phase fluctuating motion by the gas.},

  abstract      = {The agri-food industry generates significant quantities of plant-based food waste from processing, which offers a valuable research opportunity aimed at minimizing and managing these wastes efficiently in support of zero waste and/or circular economies. In order to achieve food security, all of these wastes can be valorized using downstream processes in an integrated manner, which results in the conversion of waste into secondary raw materials. Specifically, plant-based food wastes and/or byproducts are recognized sources of bioactive chemicals, including dietary fibers that are beneficial as food additives or functional food ingredients that can meet the technological and functional requirements of health-promoting value-added products. Additionally, cellulosic ingredients can be utilized directly within nonfood industries, such as textiles, resulting in a reduction in the environmental impact of secondary raw materials, as well as an increase in market acceptance compared to those currently on the market. On this basis, the present review was designed to provide an overview of introducing novel concepts for effective reuse, recyclability, and maximal utilization of plant-based food wastes and/or byproducts from food-processing industries, which creates a potential opportunity for the extraction of value-added dietary fiber with potential applications in food and nonfood industries.},

With the availability of a high frequency data system, the instantaneous particle velocity was determined by dividing the local instantaneous local density into local instantaneous mass flow. Statistica! correlation gives local average velocity, intensity of particle motion, frequency of fluctuation, and particle difksivity. Glass particles of 100 pm suspended in air were tested.

  abstract      = {The effect of small particles on decaying grid-generated turbulence is studied experimentally. Using a two-camera system, instantaneous fluid-phase and particle-phase measurements can be obtained simultaneously. The data obtained with this system are used to study the decay behaviour of the turbulent flow. The role of particle size, particle density and volume load is studied in a number of different cases. These cases are chosen so that the individual role of these parameters can systematically be evaluated. Addition of particles to the flow has significant effects on the decaying turbulence: first, the onset of the turbulent decay appears to shift upstream; second, the flow becomes anisotropic as it develops downstream. The latter is observed as an increase in integral length scale in the vertical direction. The rate at which the flow becomes anisotropic can be predicted using a new parameter: the product of the non-dimensional number density and the Stokes number (referred to as the `Stokes load'). This parameter, combining the relevant fluid and particle characteristics, is a measure for the energy redistribution leading to anisotropy. In addition to redistributing energy, the particles also produce turbulence. However, this only becomes evident when the grid-generated turbulence has decayed sufficiently, relatively far downstream of the grid. The turbulence production by particles can also account for the observed decrease in slope of the power spectrum, which leads to a `cross-over' effect. The production of turbulence by the particles can be predicted using a model for the momentum deficit of the particle wakes. The validity of this approach is confirmed using conditional sampling of the fluid velocity field around the particles.},

There are different approaches to teaching safety, from incorporation of safety into every aspect of a degree programme, to focusing all the safety teaching within stand-alone courses, to an integrated approach which simultaneously combines both approaches to varying extents. Effective safety teaching is also dependent on the experience and knowledge of the teaching staff involved and the locational context of the institution. Here, the novel and comprehensive approaches taken to inherently embed safety teaching within a chemical engineering programme, which is part of the wider Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP) teaching framework at UCL's Faculty of Engineering Sciences, are examined and its success is measured against student perceptions. Students following the IEP chemical engineering degree programme widely recognise that safety teaching is immediately embedded into the curriculum from the first year and they are given increasing opportunities to apply safety learnings throughout their degree. This leads to a feeling of preparedness for their capstone design projects and future industrial roles, ultimately achieving the aim of developing well-rounded, responsible graduate engineers with a strong safety culture embedded in the way they will approach their future work.},

Among various kinds of cavitation reactors, a swirling jet-induced cavitation reactor that has been less studied was investigated in detail for the first time in this work. Recently, researchers have focused more on investigating the parameters that affect the process and control its intensity. In the present work, the efficacy of the operating pressure on the performance of the cavitating device was investigated by calculating the cavitational efficacy ratio (CER) using full three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations. Also, preliminary studies were carried out for the first time to optimize the curvature correction coefficient of the shear stress transport k–\ensuremath{\omega} viscous model to sensitize it to streamline curvature to obtain convergence and stability of the simulations. The optimum operating pressure was found by solving the cavity dynamics equations and calculating the CER parameter. The Rayleigh–Plesset cavity dynamics equation was applied to the cavity trajectory obtained from solving the discrete phase model to track the cavity radius and inside pressure variations. Finally, the validation of the simulation and estimated optimum operating pressure were done by the experimental data reported in the literature that there was reasonable agreement between them.},

The utilization of carbon co-products plays a critical role in the success of any commercial CH4 pyrolysis process. Several recent reviews on CH4 pyrolysis have focused on catalysts, reactor design, and chemical process development, with limited discussion on carbon co-products. This review summarizes recent research findings (i.e., from 2018 to 2023) related to solid carbon co-products from CH4 pyrolysis. The different types of CH4 pyrolysis methods are first categorized based on catalysts, heating methods, and energy sources. Next, the current understanding of the carbon material formation mechanism in CH4 pyrolysis is summarized. Afterward, carbon materials produced by various methods are compared, including non-catalytic gaseous pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis using metal catalysts, carbon catalysts, and molten metals/salts. Further, studies on the applications of these solid carbon co-products are discussed. Overall, diverse carbon materials are currently produced in CH4 pyrolysis with limited controls. Systematic studies of carbon materials' purification and applications are still limited. Last, we propose several future research topics critical to realizing CH4 pyrolysis as a low-emission H2 production process.},

The system consists of two interconnected circulating fluidized bed reactors with globally circulating bed material (dual circulating fluidized bed – DCFB). Gas mixing between the two reactors is prevented by moderately fluidized loop seals. In the cold model, both reactors are fluidized with air at two stages to control the solids circulation. The data presented focus on the solids circulation rates and on pressure profiles of both reactors, depending on selected operating parameters like fluidization gas flow rate, level of gas introduction, loop seal fluidization, and solids inventory. The results show high solids circulations in the global loop between the two reactors for the scaled base case operation conditions already at low bed inventories.},

Fundamental details of ethylene oxidation by supported Ag/\ensuremath{\alpha}-Al2O3 catalysts were revealed with the application of high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HAADF-STEM-EDS), in situ techniques (Raman, UV–vis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), HS-LEIS), chemical probes (C2H4-TPSR and C2H4 + O2-TPSR), and steady-state ethylene oxidation and SSITKA (16O2 \rightarrow{} 18O2 switch) studies. The Ag nanoparticles are found to carry a considerable amount of oxygen after the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the oxidative reconstructed p(4 \texttimes{} 4)–O–Ag(111) surface is stable relative to metallic Ag(111) under the relevant reaction environment. Multiple configurations of reactive oxygen species are present, and their relevant concentrations depend on treatment conditions. Selective ethylene oxidation to EO proceeds with surface Ag4–O2\textasteriskcentered species (dioxygen species occupying an oxygen site on a p(4 \texttimes{} 4)–O–Ag(111) surface) only present after strong oxidation of Ag. These experimental findings are strongly supported by the associated DFT calculations. Ethylene epoxidation proceeds via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, and ethylene combustion proceeds via combined Langmuir–Hinshelwood (predominant) and Mars–van Krevelen (minor) mechanisms.},

The model was derived without introducing any empirical factors, so it can be used for more flow conditions in circulating fluidized beds (CFBs) than empirical models, especially for heterogeneous gas–solid two-phase flows that include cluster formation. Non-uniform particle distribution in computational cells, which is usually not described by the differential equations, is also considered in the new drag model.

The experimental data obtained from this work and in the literature show that when the scaling parameter, Gs/( pUg), is modified as Fr-D0.3Gs/( pUg), a detailed hydrodynamic similitude of the gas–solid flow in the fully developed zone of the risers under different operating conditions can be achieved. Furthermore, the experimental results from different gas–solid flow systems also show that as long as Fr-D0.3Gs/( pUg) remains constant, there is the same solid concentration in the fully developed zone of different CFB risers with different particles. With the same Fr-D0.3Gs/( pUg), the local solid concentrations, the descending particle velocities, the cluster frequencies and the solid concentrations inside clusters in the fully developed zone of the risers all display the same axial and radial distribution, respectively. In other words, the empirical similarity parameter, Fr-D0.3Gs/( pUg), appears to have incorporated the effects of operating parameters (Gs and Ug), so that, the gas–solid flow in the fully developed zone of CFB risers under those different operating conditions but having the same Fr-D0.3Gs/( pUg) shows similar micro- and macro-hydrodynamic characteristics. The study shows that the empirical similarity parameter, Fr-D0.3Gs/( pUg), is also independent of the upward gas–solid flow systems.},

The results show that the nozzle gas distributor design has significant effects on the axial and radial flow structure for the FCC and sand particles. At lower superficial gas velocity of less than 8.0 m/s, the upward gas-solid flow of the sand particles decelerates in various degrees with the disappearing of the nozzle gas distributor effect. The upward gas-solid flow of the FCC particles, however, occurs without noticeable deceleration within the range of this study. In the acceleration section, the radial distributions of the local solids concentration of the FCC particles are more uniform than those of sand particles under the same operating conditions; while in the fully developed zone, the sand particles have a more uniform radial distribution than the FCC particles. The gas-solid flow is first developed in the center region, and then extends towards the wall.

  abstract      = {To investigate solids concentration in the fully developed region of co-current downward gas–solid flow, actual solids concentrations were measured in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) downer with 9.3 m in height and 0.1 m in diameter using a fiber optical probe. The results obtained from this work and in the literature show that the average solids concentration in the fully developed region of the CFB downers is not only a function of the corresponding terminal solids concentration, but the operating conditions and particle properties also have influences on the average solids concentration in the fully developed region of the CFB downers. Particle diameter and density affect the solids concentrations differently under different operating conditions. Downer diameters almost have no influence on the solids concentrations. By taking into account the effects of operating conditions, particle properties and downer diameters, an empirical correlation to predict the solids concentrations in the fully developed region of CFB downers is proposed. The predictions of the correlation are in good agreement with the experimental data of this work and in the literature.},

  abstract      = {The present work focuses on developing a new comprehensive correlation for better prediction of the solids concentration in the fully developed region of co-current upward gas–solid flow in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers. Systematic experiments were carried out in two risers (15.1 m and 10.5 m high with the same 0.1 m i.d.) with FCC and sand particles. The results obtained from about 200 sets of operating conditions show that the average solids concentration in the fully developed region is more than just a function of the corresponding terminal solids concentration, as most previous correlations are based on. Operating conditions, particle properties and riser diameters also have significant effects on the solids concentrations in the fully developed region of CFB risers. Based on our experimental data and those reported in the open literature from CFB risers up to 0.4 m in diameter and 27 m in height with superficial gas velocities and solids circulation rates up to 11.5 m/s and 685 kg/m2\cdot{}s, a new empirical correlation for predicting the average solids concentrations in the fully developed region of CFB risers is proposed.

  abstract      = {Numerical studies were conducted for different inlet particle concentrations of a cyclone. The simplified Eulerian model--Algebraic Slip Mixture Model (ASMM) was used for different inlet particle concentrations. With the increase of the inlet particle concentration, particle–particle interaction becomes important. ASMM can take into account this effect in this condition. The present work considered the particle of different size as different phase, and obtained a collision coefficient by experiment when considering the interaction between particles. The advantage of the ASMM is that this model can save a lot of calculating time comparing with the full Eulerian model. However, higher inlet particle concentration will result in the agglomeration between particles deduced by some mechanisms. In point of this fact, the calculated results based on ASMM have some differences comparing with the practical ones. Therefore, this model still has some discrepancies which plead for further improvement. In spite of this fact, this model can be used to analyze the effect of the inlet particle concentration on the separation characteristics of the cyclone qualitatively in practical applications.},

  abstract      = {We show hydrodynamic boundary conditions to be the inherent consequence of the Onsager principle of minimum energy dissipation, provided the relevant effects of the wall potential appear within a thin fluid layer next to the solid wall, denoted the surface layer. The condition that the effect of the surface layer on the bulk hydrodynamics must be independent of its thickness               h               is shown to imply a set of consistent `scaling relationships' between               h               and the surface-layer variables/parameters. The use of the scaling relations, in conjunction with the surface-layer equations of motion derived from the Onsager principle, directly leads to the hydrodynamic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the surface-layer scaling process both physically and mathematically, and relate the parameters of the boundary conditions to those in the surface-layer equations of motion. In spatial regions outside the surface layer, equivalence between the use of surface-layer dynamics and boundary conditions is numerically demonstrated for Couette flows. As an application of the present approach, we derive the liquid-crystal hydrodynamic boundary conditions in which the rotational and translational dynamics are coupled.},

However, the growth of Li dendrite increases polarization, reduces battery capacity, and connects the positive and negative electrodes, which will probably lead to explosions. Therefore, inhibiting Li dendrites is critical for Li metal battery application and safety. In this paper, the effect of temperature on Li dendrite is analyzed quantitatively by coupling the nonlinear phase-field and thermal models. The effect of temperature on ``dead Li'' is also studied. The suitable frequency for Li dendrite inhibition can be obtained by changing the frequency of the pulse charging. On the basis of the simulation results, the mechanisms of inhibiting Li dendrites by rising temperature and pulse charging are also analyzed. The investigation of the average growth rate of dendrites under different overpotential values and diffusion coefficients indicates that the gap between the reaction and diffusion rates must be narrowed to inhibit Li dendrites. This work provides a deep understanding of and direction toward inhibiting Li dendrites.},

Then the simulation of expanding bubble through a hole in a channel driven by pressure is presented. The dynamic process of expanding bubble is revealed through the change of bubble size and the deformation of bubble shape during it flowing along the channel.

One of the world's most enormous treasure troves of mineral databases, Mindat ("mindat.org"), contains vast amounts of knowledge that are yet to be mined. Through a project called OpenMindat, an application programming interface (API) to enable open data query and access from Mindat had been set up. This paper presented an open-source R package (OpenMindat v1.0.0) to bridge the data highway, connecting users' overwhelming data needs, facilitating data-intensive query and access, unlocking novel insights, and enabling groundbreaking geoscience discoveries. The package was designed to be user-friendly and extensible. It exploits the capabilities of the Mindat API, including the data subjects of geomaterials (e.g., rocks, minerals, synonyms, variety, mixture, and commodity), localities, and the IMA (International Mineralogical Association)-approved mineral list. In addition to providing functions for querying those data subjects, the package supports exporting data to various formats such as CSV, JSON-LD, and TTL. In applications, these functions only require minor coding and provide invaluable convenience for users with limited R environment experience. The package is open on GitHub under the MIT license and with detailed tutorial documentation. The field of mineralogy and many other geoscience disciplines are facing the opportunities enabled by open data. Various research topics such as mineral network analysis, mineral association rule mining, mineral ecology, mineral evolution, and critical minerals have already benefited from Mindat's open data. We hope this R package will accelerate the process of those data-intensive studies and lead to more scientific discoveries.{\$<\$}/p{\$>\$}},

Once the catalyst activity is stabilized, the influence of temperature, total pressure and space velocity is studied for kinetic characterisation. A data set comprising of 153 experimental runs has been used to develop a kinetic model capable to accurately predict the reaction rate. Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows an apparent activation energy of 80.1 kJ mol-1 in CO2 hydrogenation. Data obtained under differential mode adjust quite precisely to a power-law model with H2O inhibition, with a water adsorption constant of 3.1 atm-1 and apparent orders of 0.24 and 0.27 for H2 and CO2, respectively. Based on DRIFTS results, we propose for the first time the H-assisted CO formation route, which is compared with the more conventionally reported carbonyl route, and describe the corresponding reaction rate LHHW equation, resulting in notable improvement for mean deviation (D) of 7.0 \% in our model related to that based on the carbonyl route (D = 20.1 \%) usually suggested for catalysts with higher Ni loads around 20 \%. The H-assisted CO formation route considers the formate species decomposition into carbonyls via H-assisted CO formation mechanism and further carbonyls hydrogenation into CHO as the rate determining step. Thus, the LHHW mechanism, in which carbonyls as well as formate species participate in CO2 methanation, is capable to reflect the kinetics of lowly-loaded Ni/Al2O 3 catalyst with high accuracy under relevant process conditions (315-430 \textdegree{}C, 1-6 bar, H2 to CO2 molar ratios between 1–16 and, different reagents and products partial pressures).},

This paper presents a numerical study on the effects of aspect ratio of rectangular nozzles on the spray characteristics and phase interactions in such spray–gas–solid three-phase flows. The gas–solid flow is simulated via Eulerian two-fluid modeling and the spray is tracked via Lagrangian trajectory approach. Our study shows that the effect of aspect ratio has a significant impact on the penetration length and trajectories of the spray jet under the same flow conditions. The vertically oriented rectangular nozzles (i.e., nozzles with aspect ratios less than unity) have deeper penetration than the horizontally oriented ones (i.e., nozzles with aspect ratios more than unity) with the same nozzle injection area whereas the effect of aspect ratio has little impact on the spray deflection. The spray cross-section maintains the rectangular shape that expands basically following the original fan angle of the nozzle jet. The simulation also shows some strong phase interactions caused by the rapid spray evaporation, such as the formation of a dense layer of solids around the spray from the compression effect of vapor expansion and rigid wall of gas–solids flow chamber and the existence of a large diluted solids region in the vicinity of downstream of nozzle from the combined effects of evaporation and vapor crossflow convection.},

  abstract      = {In order to optimize the design process of pneumatic or hydraulic conveying systems, all possible modes, cases, patterns etc. of the two-phase flow (fluid-solids) must be known and understood. One of the most significant parameters for designing conveying systems is the threshold velocity for picking up the initially at rest deposited particles. Numerous studies focus on the pickup velocity from a horizontal layer of particles. However, the pickup mechanism from hill-shaped deposits has gained much less attention. The main aim of this work is to investigate the air flow over the deposits of particles (including both horizontal layers and hillshaped particles) and to determine the minimum air velocity for picking up the particles from the deposits. Based on our experimental results and an empirical analysis of seven different materials, covering a wide range of properties, we found that the pickup velocity strongly depends on the deposit height and shape. It was also found that there is a relationship between the pickup velocities from particle deposits and from a layer of particles. This relationship takes into account the ratio between the wind tunnel and the deposit height and the particulate solids angle of repose which defines the deposit shape.},

Feeding biomass solids into pressurized reactors is one of the key steps in biomass conversion. Predicting mechanical failure and energy requirements for this step helps avoid upstream processing bottlenecks and enables efficient operation of a biorefinery. In this work, we developed a predictive computational model for biomass screw feeders that capture the highly viscous, non-Newtonian and compressible behavior of biomass slurries. Biomass compressible behavior is formulated by an equation of state and the non-Newtonian rheology is represented by a density-dependent viscosity model. Experimental data from two compression screw-feeder systems are presented as a validation for our model. Our model successfully predicted the location of the compressed biomass ``plug'', biomass flow rate, and the required torque at different operating conditions for the experimental conditions studied in this work.},

This paper presents measurements of the particle  pressure on the faces of a two-dimensional gas-fluidized bed and gives insight into the  mechanisms by which bubbles generate particle pressure. The particle pressure is  measured by a specially designed `particle pressure transducer'. The results show that,  around single bubbles, the most significant particle pressures are generated below  and to the sides of the bubble and that these particle pressures steadily increase and  reach a maximum value at bubble eruption. The dominant mechanism appears to be  defluidization of material in the particle phase that results from the bubble attracting  fluidizing gas away from the surrounding material; the surrounding material is no  longer supported by the gas flow and can only be supported across interparticle  contacts which results in the observed particle pressures. The contribution of particle  motion to particle pressure generation is insignificant.             The magnitude of the particle pressure below a single bubble in a gas-fluidized  bed depends on the bubble size and the density of the solid particles, as might be  expected as the amount of gas attracted by the bubble should increase with bubble  size and because the weight of defluidized material depends on the density of the  solid material. A simple scaling of these quantities is suggested that is otherwise  independent of the bed material.             In freely bubbling gas-fluidized beds the particle pressures generated behave  differently. Overall they are smaller in magnitude and reach their maximum value soon  after the bubble passes instead of at eruption. In this situation, it appears that the  bubbles interact with one another in such a way that the de uidization effect below a  leading bubble is largely counteracted by refluidizing gas exiting the roof of trailing  bubbles.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.},

Early modeling methodologies focused on mathematically capturing the process knowledge and domain expertise of the modeler. The models thus developed are termed first principles models (or white-box models). Over time, computational power became cheaper, and massive amounts of data became available for modeling. This led to the development of cutting edge machine learning models (black-box models) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hybrid models (gray-box models) are a combination of first principles and machine learning models. The development of hybrid models has captured the attention of researchers as this combines the best of both modeling paradigms. Recent attention to this field stems from the interest in explainable AI (XAI), a critical requirement as AI systems become more pervasive. This work aims at identifying and categorizing various hybrid models available in the literature that integrate machine-learning models with different forms of domain knowledge. Benefits such as enhanced predictive power, extrapolation capabilities, and other advantages of combining the two approaches are summarized. The goal of this article is to consolidate the published corpus in the area of hybrid modeling and develop a comprehensive framework to understand the various techniques presented. This framework can further be used as the foundation to explore rational associations between several models.},

Together with other open data resources, Mindat has helped accelerate scientific discoveries in many fields, such as mineral evolution, mineral ecology, and the co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere. Recently, through open data efforts, machine interfaces and software packages have been established to enable flexible data discovery and download from Mindat. We assume the data access and usage will further scale up in the next years. Although Mindat is curated by a team of geoscience and database experts across the world, the crowd-sourced records in Mindat still pose some bias. In this paper we first present an overview of the primary data subjects in Mindat, and then we give extensive details about the characteristics and bias of three most popular data subjects: locality, mineral species, and mineral occurrence. In the discussion we also give an outlook on appropriate data usage and future extension of data records. We hope users can obtain a more comprehensive view of the Mindat database through this paper and thus better plan their data use. We also hope more people will be inspired to contribute to the data curation work to make Mindat a sustained data ecosystem for geoscience research.}

Subsequently, a first-principles-based dynamic model of the FCC unit is implemented to closely simulate the FCC unit under investigation. The model is validated by predicting the measured operating data of the FCC unit.

  abstract      = {Wall-to-bed mass transfer coefficients were computed in a three-phase fluidized bed in plain annuli and in the absence and presence of a helicoidal tape wound on a coaxial central rod of varying diameters using electrochemical technique. Glass spheres were used as solid phase, an electrolyte (equimolar ferri–ferrocyanide solution) as liquid-phase and nitrogen as gaseous phase. The test section was an acrylic cylindrical column of 6.73 cm i.d. Limiting current measurements were made at point copper electrodes fixed flush with the test section, which facilitated the computation of wallto-bed mass transfer coefficients. Augmentation in wall-to-bed mass transfer coefficient was found to be significant with increased liquid and gas velocities, and particle diameter. The presence of composite promoter showed significant improvements in the wall-to-bed mass transfer coefficients. The data on wall-to-bed mass transfer coefficient were correlated in terms of Coulburn jD factor, individual phase holdups, particle Reynolds number and geometrical parameters of the composite promoter as jD\ensuremath{\epsilon}L = 0.14[((Rep\ensuremath{\epsilon})/(\ensuremath{\epsilon}L(1 - \ensuremath{\epsilon})))(1 + (p/Dc ))]-0.23.},

The challenges of scaling up from laboratory to commercial processes are addressed through the adoption of Process Analytical Technology frameworks and Quality by Design principles. The application of various modeling approaches beyond downstream and upstream processes in vaccine production is discussed in detail. These in silico process simulation approaches enable deeper understanding of manufacturing dynamics, identification of critical process parameters, and the development of well-defined design spaces, ultimately leading to accelerated vaccine development and improved product quality. The authors stress the significance of an integrated modeling platform for vaccine manufacturing, exemplified by the Inno4Vac project.

  abstract      = {Riser reactors are frequently applied in catalytic processes involving rapid catalyst deactivation. Typically heterogeneous flow structures prevail because of the clustering of particles, which impacts the quality of the gas–solid contact. This phenomenon results as a competition between fluid–particle interaction (i.e., drag) and particle–particle interaction (i.e., collisions). In this study, five drag force correlations were used in a combined computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method Immersed Boundary Model to predict the clustering. The simulation results were compared with experimental data obtained from a pseudo-2D riser in the fast fluidization regime. The clusters were detected on the basis of a core–wake approach using constant thresholds. Although good predictions for the global (solids volume fraction and mass flux) variables and cluster (spatial distribution, size, and number of clusters) variables were obtained with two of the approaches in most of the simulations, all the correlations show significant deviations in the onset of a pneumatic transport regime. However, the correlations of Felice ( Int. J. Multiphase Flow 1994, 20, 153-159) and Tang et al. [ AIChE J. 2015, 61 (2), 688-698] show the closest correspondence for the time-averaged quantities and the clustering behavior in the fast fluidization regime.},

  abstract      = {Riser reactors are frequently applied in the process industry for highly important catalytic processes. In this work, a computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) for a riser with liquid injection was developed. This model treats the gas as a continuous phase whereas the liquid droplets and catalyst particles are treated as discrete elements. The presence of droplets causes particles to be wet, which is taken into account via coverage models of the particles. In addition, the liquid on the particles will change the collision behavior, which is included using an energy balance approach. This CFD-DEM study is conducted simulating a lab-scale pseudo-2D riser. Based on the comparison, the assumption of fully covered particles results in a significant increase in the solids holdup and clustering behavior of the riser which, especially at the low liquid flow rate, results in an over-prediction. The partial coverage simulations show that only half of the particles are covered, which has a major effect on the collisions.},

The first case reports data on influence of number of passes through HC reactor on bio-methane generation from bagasse. The second case reports data on influence of HC reactor scale on degradation of dichloroaniline (DCA). Similar to most of the HC based applications, the availability of experimental data for these two applications is rather limited. In this work a systematic methodology for developing ANN model is presented. The models were shown to describe the experimental data very well. The ANN models were then evaluated for their ability to interpolate and extrapolate. Despite the limited data, the ANN models were able to simulate and interpolate the data for two very different and complex HC applications very well. The extrapolated results of biomethane generation in terms of number of passes were consistent with the intuitive understanding. The extrapolated results in terms of elapsed time were however not consistent with the intuitive understanding. The ANN model was able to generate intuitively consistent extrapolated results for degradation of DCA in terms of number of passes as well as scale of HC reactor. The results will be useful for developing quantitative models of complex HC applications.},

  abstract      = {Intense and localised physico-chemical effects realised by cavitation such as generation of hydroxyl radicals, high-speed jets, and very high energy dissipation rates are being harnessed for a wide range of applications from emulsions, crystallisation, reactions to water treatment and waste valorisation. Single cavity models are typically used to quantitatively estimate such localised effects of cavity collapse. However, these models demand significant computing resources for resolving fast dynamics and therefore are very difficult, if not impossible, to integrate with CFD based cavitation device or reactor scale models. This severely limits the utility of device/ reactor scale models in simulating key applications of interest. In this work, we present, for the first time, artificial neural network (ANN) based surrogate models which accurately represent complex physico-chemical effects of cavity collapse. Recently developed cavity dynamics model was used for generating training data set encompassing both acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation. Appropriate methodology for training ANN was developed. A shallow three hidden layer dense ANN was found to be more effective for estimating three main effects of cavity collapse: jet velocity, \textbullet{}OH generation and localised energy dissipation rate. The performance of trained ANN was then evaluated by comparing the predictions with the totally unseen data obtained from the cavity dynamics model. The developed ANN was shown to simulate unseen data very well not just within the range of training data (interpolation) but also beyond (extrapolation). Algebraic equations representing ANN are included to facilitate incorporation in device/ reactor scale CFD models. The presented methodology and results will be useful for developing high-fidelity CFD models of cavitation devices/ reactors based on key physico-chemical effects of cavity collapse.},

  abstract      = {Particle-turbulence interaction in wall turbulent flows has been studied. A series of experiments varying particle size, particle density, particle loading and flow Re has been conducted. The results show that the larger polystyrene particles (1100/am) cause an increase in the number of wall ejections, giving rise to an increase in the measured values of the turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses. On the other hand, the smaller polystyrene particles (120 9m) bring about a decrease in the number of wall ejections, causing a decrease in the measured intensities and Reynolds stresses. These effects are enhanced as the particle loading is increased. It was also found that the heavier glass particles (88 \#m) do not bring about any significant modulation of turbulence. In addition, measurements of the burst frequency and the mean streak-spacing show no significant change with increase in particle loading. Based on these observations, a mechanism of particle transport in wall turbulent flows has been proposed, in which the particles are transported (depending on their size, density and flow Re) by the bursting events of the wall regions.},

We examine difficulties in minimizing the PINN loss function, particularly due to ill-conditioning caused by differential operators in the residual term. We compare gradient-based optimizers Adam, L-BFGS, and their combination Adam+L-BFGS, showing the superiority of Adam+L-BFGS, and introduce a novel second-order optimizer, NysNewton-CG (NNCG), which significantly improves PINN performance. Theoretically, our work elucidates the connection between ill-conditioned differential operators and ill-conditioning in the PINN loss and shows the benefits of combining first- and second-order optimization methods. Our work presents valuable insights and more powerful optimization strategies for training PINNs, which could improve the utility of PINNs for solving difficult partial differential equations.},

Mandatory environmental regulations have imposed stringent quality limits on refinery products, especially on gasoline and diesel fuels. Through selection and effective utilization of catalyst and additives, refiners have been successful in achieving value additions as well as in meeting product quality norms. FCC catalyst market is competitive and it is often difficult to select catalyst based on vendor's claims. It is important to match the plant performance closely to understand unit constraints and exploit the new catalyst capabilities to full extent. Authors, using state-of-the-art facilities for catalyst characterization, evaluation and simulation tools selected superior catalysts and additives for their commercial units. The paper elaborates the laboratory evaluation methodology adopted; modeling techniques used for making yield predictions and presents case studies of successful catalyst and additive selection and use in a commercial FCC unit.},

The local conductivity measured by a number of electrodes located at the periphery of the plane was then further converted into a local phase concentration distribution based on Maxwell's relation. The results obtained by PTs, when combined with ERT results, were used to determine gas and solid holdups. Fibre optic probe was also employed to measure gas holdup independently. To measure gas and solid holdup, a model was introduced to exploit the fibre optic data in differentiating gas bubbles from solid particles in the riser.

Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) as an imaging technique was employed for the study of flow parameters such as phase holdup, velocity distribution of individual phases in LSCFB. ERT is a non-invasive technique based on conductivity measurement of the continuous phase, which also provides color-coded cross-sectional view of phases with a frequency of up to 250 images per second. The local conductivity measured by a number of electrodes located at the periphery of the plane was then further converted into a local phase concentration distribution based on Maxwell's relation. Local solids holdup also measured by using optical fibre probe to compare and verify the result obtained by ERT. By cross-correlation between the data obtained from a pair of planes of ERT, one upstream and one downstream, the phase propagation velocity was determined. Water was used as the continuous and conductive phase and glass beads and lava rocks (LR) of 500 m sizes were used as the solid and non-conductive phase in this investigation. Radial non-uniformity of phase holdups was observed at different superficial liquid velocities. Solids holdup was higher in regions close to the wall and low in the central area. Such non-uniformity in phase holdup decreased with increasing liquid velocity. Both solids holdup and radial non-uniformity increased with superficial solids velocity. The solids propagation velocity increased in the central region under different superficial liquid velocities. Good agreement was observed between the data obtained from the two methods.},

Large-scale CFB calciners have replaced the rotary kiln in the alumina industry. Combustion of carbon-containing fossil fuels and process residues for energy supply with accompanying low levels of noxious emissions is one of the most promising fields of future applications, especially in the power industry and municipal combined heat and power generation.

  abstract      = {Conventional continuum models for ion transport across polyamide membranes require solving partial differential equations (PDEs). These models typically introduce a host of assumptions and simplifications to improve the computational tractability of existing solvers. As a consequence of these constraints, conventional models struggle to generalize predictive performance to new unseen conditions. Deep learning has recently shown promise in alleviating many of these concerns, making it a promising avenue for surrogate models that can replace conventional PDE-based approaches. In this work, we develop a physics-informed deep learning model to predict ion transport across diverse membrane types. The proposed architecture leverages neural differential equations in conjunction with classical closure models as inductive biases directly encoded into the neural framework. The neural methods are pre-trained on simulated data from continuum models and fine-tuned on independent experiments to learn multi-ionic rejection behaviour. We also harness the attention mechanism, commonly observed in language modelling, to learn and infer key paired transport relationships. Gaussian noise augmentations from experimental uncertainty estimates are also introduced into the measured data to improve robustness and generalization. We study the neural framework's performance relative to conventional PDE-based methods, and also compare the use of hard/soft inductive bias constraints on prediction accuracy. Lastly, we compare our approach to other competitive deep learning architectures and illustrate strong agreement with experimental measurements across all studied datasets.},

Several evolution trends that have been structuring IPM developments over this extended period of time are briefly referred, with more focus on data-driven approaches. We also argue that, besides such trends, the research focus has also evolved. The initial period was centred on optimizing IPM detection performance. More recently, root cause analysis and diagnosis gained importance and a variety of approaches were proposed to expand IPM with this new and important monitoring dimension. We believe that, in the future, the emphasis will be to bring yet another dimension to IPM: prognosis. Some perspectives are put forward in this regard, including the strong interplay of the Process and Maintenance departments, hitherto managed as separated silos.},

The main objective of this integration is to favor sustainable human education and to increase students' awareness and responsibility towards future generations from the chemical engineering point of view. Within the process engineering course, the students must design a chemical process using technical, economic, social and environmental criteria. Active learning methodologies were gradually introduced in different academic courses (Project-Based Learning, Collaborative Work and Flipped Classroom) and finally SDGs were implemented in the 2020–21 academic course. A synergetic effect with the active learning methodologies was observed, increasing the motivation of the students and the academics, and the complexity of the projects performed by students. The introduction of the SDGs improved academic results, which was reflected in the absence of failures and a decrease in the percentage of students passing with the lowest grade from 16\,\% to 10\,\%. Moreover, students report that this project significantly enhanced their knowledge of the SDGs related to energy and climate change; students having low or very low knowledge about SDGs were reduced to 7\,\% as compared to the initial 45\,\%.},

However, it faces significant challenges related to low collector recoveries and similarity in the surface characteristics of the minerals, which make the effective separation of this valuable mineral difficult. For this reason, numerous researchers have conducted studies to address and confront this problem. In this work, an exhaustive bibliographic search was carried out using keywords and search queries, and the results were structured in three sections according to temporal, methodological, and thematic criteria. The first section covers the period from 1950 to 2004, focusing on experimental tests. The second section covers from 2004 to the present and focuses on flotation tests and measurement analysis. Simultaneously, the third section spans from 2011 to the present and is based on molecular dynamics simulations. Topics covered include spodumene surface properties, the influence of metal ions, pre-treatment techniques, and the use of collectors. Ultimately, molecular dynamics simulations are positioned as a tool that accurately represents experimental phenomena. In this context, specialized software such as Materials Studio or Gromacs prove to be reliable instruments that allow a detailed study of mineral surfaces and other elements to be carried out, which justifies their consideration for future research in this scientific field.},

  abstract      = {A sampling probe operating in a non-isokinetic manner was used to measure variations of local solids mass flux with radial, angular and axial position and time in the 152 mm i.d. riser of a circulating fluidixed bed cold model. Time-averaged solids flux profiles exhibit a typically flattened parabolic shape with a region of downward flow adjacent to the riser wall. These profiles do not generally exhibit axial symmetry and a minimum of six radial profiles measurements are found to be necessary to describe the flow pattern adequately. These angular non-uniformities are reproducible, difficult to eliminate and although their form is probably system dependent, it is thought that such non-uniformities are likely to exist in all such gas-particle flow systems to a greater or lesser extent. Detail of the nature of the flowing suspension near to the riser wall has been delineated by analysis of variations in local solids flux with time measured using an adaptation of the same sampling probe.},

These profiles have a parabolic form and exhibit a strong downward solids flow near to the riser wall. A core-annulus flow model is proposed for the refluxing dilute-phase transport regime found typically in the circulating fluidized beds, riser reactors, vertical pneumatic conveying and the freeboards of bubbling fluidized beds.

Particles in this region were found to move predominantly downwards, against the main gas flow. High density groups or swarms of particles typically arch-shaped were observed to descend in contact with the wall at velocities in the range 0.3-0.4 m s-`. The distribution of swarm descent velocities was shown to be little affected by changes in superficial gas velocity over the range 3-5 m s-l and imposed mean solids mass flux over the range 2 to 80 kg m-\textasteriskcentered s- r. A region of steady bulk downflow of solids with a velocity of approximately 1.0 m s-l was observed to appear a few millimetres from the wall at mean suspension densities greater than 5.6 kg rnm3. Motion of particles in contact with the riser was analysed by identification of three flow forms; dilute, dense and swarm flow. Results of the analysis are linked with the observations of other workers concerning the onset of the so-called `similar profiles' regime. The relationship between the measured effective particle swarm length and the cross-sectional mean suspension density was established and the implications for modelling suspension-to-wall heat transfer discussed.},

The flow structure is characterised by measurement of radial profiles of solids momentum and solids volume fraction in a riser 0.09 m in diameter and 7.2 m high using a momentum probe and capacitance tomography. The solids used were sand with a Sauter mean diameter of 100 \ensuremath{\mu}m and particle density of 2650 kg/m3. The core-annalus suspension structure typically found in the upper dilute region of the fast bed is found to extend throughout the S-shaped profile and into the lower dense region. However, the direction of solids flow in the annulus changes from downwards in the upper dilute region to upwards in the lower dense region. The interface between the regions (the middle of the S) is found to be a region of relatively low axial solids momentum throughout the riser cross-section. The fast fluidized bed structure suggested by these observations is presented in the form of a diagram.},

To bridge the gap between theoretical education and market requirements, a "Project Planning Course'' has been offered since 2018 as part of the MSc specialization in Chemical Engineering at the FHNW School of Life Sciences. The course didactics combines the principles of an ``agile'' teaching mindset and problem-based learning, which optimally support the experience of this module. Students had to work on unresolved real-world problems, make decisions based on incomplete information, and present their work in a board meeting role play with board members from industry. These situations represent typical real-world challenges for future chemical engineers. The results show that most of the students learned to cope with the unconventional teaching methodology. The students' evaluations of the module have been very positive, especially the fact that the active participation of the students triggers the actual learning process - which means that the essential learning goal has been achieved.},

  abstract      = {Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis (CMP) is an innovative method to convert gaseous methane into valuable H2 and carbon products. The catalytic approach to methane pyrolysis has the potential to decrease the required operating temperature for methane decomposition from {$>$}1000~\textdegree{}C to under 700~\textdegree{}C. In this work, a novel inexpensive catalyst is discussed that displays low operating temperatures, while still maintaining high reactivity and long proven lifetimes. The kinetics associated with the catalyst's performance are modeled and a correlation was developed for use with practical simulation tools. A techno-economic assessment was conducted applying experimentally determined kinetics for the CMP reaction with the specific catalyst. Two process concepts that utilize CMP using the novel catalyst are presented in this work. Optimizations were considered in these processes and the CO2 emissions and cost of hydrogen production of the two optimized cases, CMP with H2 combustion (CMP-H2) and CMP with CH4 Combustion (CMP-CH4), are compared to that of the current industrial standard for hydrogen production, Steam Methane Reforming with carbon capture and sequestration (SMR-CCS). Both of the proposed concepts convert methane into gaseous hydrogen and valuable carbon products, graphitic carbon to carbon Nano fibers. The carbon price was treated as a variable to determine the sensitivity of hydrogen production cost to the carbon price. The analysis indicates that cost of hydrogen production is highly dependent on the recovery and sale of carbon byproducts. Based on Aspen modeling of these two concepts for large scale hydrogen production (216 tons/day), the cost of hydrogen production, without considering carbon sales, was estimated to be \${\$<\$}3.25/kg, assuming a natural gas price of \$7/MMBTU and conservative catalyst cost of \$8/kg. Assuming 100\% recovery of carbon, the price can be reduced to \$0/kg by selling the carbon at {\$<\$\$}1/kg. A market assessment suggests that values of graphitic carbon and carbon fibers range from \textasciitilde\$10/kg and \textasciitilde\$25–113/kg, respectively. The cost of H2 production via conventional SMR is \textasciitilde\$2.2/kg when accounting for the cost of CO2 sequestration. The proposed processes produce a maximum of 0–2~kg CO2/kg H2 in contrast to the 10~kg CO2/kg H2 produced via conventional SMR-CCS. The process displays an enormous potential for competitive economics accompanied by reduced greenhouse gas emissions.},

Liquid-like nanoparticle organic hybrid materials functionalized with polyethylenimine (NOHM-I-PEI) are incorporated into a shell material and UV-cured to produce gas-permeable solid sorbents with uniform NOHMs loading (NPEI-SIPs). The CO2 capture kinetics of NPEI-SIPs show a remarkable 50-fold increase compared to that of neat NOHM-I-PEI due to a large increase in the NOHMs-CO2 interfacial surface area provided by the SIP design. The optimum NOHM-I-PEI loading and sorption temperature are found to be \approx{}49 wt\% and 50 \textdegree{}C, respectively, and NPEI-SIPs exhibit great thermal stability over 20 CO2 capture/sorbent regeneration temperature swing cycles. The pseudoequilibrium CO2 loadings of NPEI-SIPs under humid conditions are as high as 3.1 mmol CO2 g-1NPEI - SIPs for 15 vol\% CO2 (postcombustion capture) and 1.7 mmol CO2 g-1NPEI - SIPs for 400 ppm (direct air capture). These findings suggest that NPEI-SIPs can effectively capture CO2 from a wide range of CO2 concentrations including direct air capture while allowing the flexible design of CO2 capture reactors by combining the benefits of liquid solvents and solid sorbents.},

The algorithm is based on an automated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) workflow that can account for different ejector geometries and operating conditions. The CFD data points are used to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) machine learning model to predict the ejector performance indicators; efficiency, mass flow rates, outflow uniformity, and entropy generation. Three use cases are investigated using this methodology: 1) performance mapping for off-design operating conditions of a given ejector, 2) design mapping of ejector performance with 5 geometry variables investigated, and 3) flow structure prediction between different ejector mixing chamber geometries. The results show that this algorithm can be used to efficiently explore ejector designs with mean average errors between 0.07 and 0.1 [–] in entrainment ratio. Furthermore, the method can to look for optimized geometries using gradient descent methods, as well as produce ejector performance maps. Additionally, the method is able to predict local flow structures of velocity and pressure inside the ejector with varied ejector geometries. The databases and GPR method implementation from this work is made available open-source for further development and research.},

Currently, ACBM products are being produced at a small scale and at an economic loss, however ACBM companies are intending to industrialize and scale-up production. This study assesses the potential environmental impact of near term ACBM production. Updated findings from recent technoeconomic assessments (TEAs) of ACBM and a life cycle assessment of Essential 8\texttrademark{} were utilized to perform a life cycle assessment of near-term ACBM production. A scenario analysis was conducted utilizing the metabolic requirements examined in the TEAs of ACBM and a purification factor from the Essential 8\texttrademark{} life cycle assessment was utilized to account for growth medium component processing. The results indicate that the environmental impact of near-term ACBM production is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than median beef production if a highly refined growth medium is utilized for ACBM production.},

The need to improve the performance of existing electrolyzers or the development of new technologies has attracted the attention of the scientific community. Commercial and open-source codes are very valuable tools in pursuing such goals. ECRs studied by CFD simulations are those used in the following applications: electrosynthesis of chemicals and drugs, electrowinning of metals, chlor-alkali, redox flow batteries, and fuel cells. They also included those used in water treatment, such as electrocoagulation, electrochemical advanced oxidation processes, water disinfection, heavy metal ion removal, electro-deionization, and electrodialysis. In the context of the existing technologies, some ECRs have been improved through the characterization of the reaction environment, with some adaptations made inside the electrolyzers, such as accommodation of electrodes, use of plastic meshes acting as turbulence promoters, design of 3D printed electrodes, use of novel fluid distributors at the inlet of the cells, and optimization of the operational conditions such as flow rate, current density, the concentration of reactants and temperature. Several novel ECRs that have been built using CFD approaches for multiple fundamental studies and commercial applications are examined. Finally, an in-depth analysis of mathematical modeling scientific challenges in designing and assessing ECRs is presented.},

However, with the shift towards online and blended/flexible learning, there is a need to adapt these graphical methods for online use. This paper presents a set of interactive graphs that can be used for fluid flow, separation process, and reaction process unit operations and aims to investigate students' opinions of the interactive graphs and their motivations for using them in their studies. The digital resource developed in the paper is a set of slim single-page applications written in HTML5 \& CSS3 with the numerical calculations undertaken in JavaScript (JS). The interactive graphs are embedded into the virtual learning environment (VLE) system Blackboard for two courses, and a paper survey is used to measure students' perceptions towards the interactive graphs and their use of them. The UTAUT2 model is used to analyse the student use of these resources. It is demonstrated that the use of online interactive graphs is popular with the students and the main driving factors are the performance expectancy and the hedonic motivation. Short scaffold questions to help students interact with the graphs are key to their usefulness. Some guidance on the use of interactive graphs is also provided.

Our asymptotic theory relies on a domain perturbation approach for small roughness amplitudes of the channel and holds for general surface shapes expandable as a Fourier series. We determine an anisotropic dispersion tensor, which depends on the characteristic wavelengths and amplitude of the surface structure. For surfaces whose corrugations are tilted with respect to the applied flow direction, we find that dispersion along the principal direction (i.e. the principal eigenvector of the dispersion tensor) is at an angle to the main flow direction and becomes enhanced relative to classical Taylor dispersion. In contrast, dispersion perpendicular to it can decrease compared to the short-time diffusivity of the particles. Furthermore, for an arbitrary surface shape represented in terms of a Fourier decomposition, we find that each Fourier mode contributes at leading order a linearly-independent correction to the classical Taylor dispersion diffusion tensor.},

  abstract      = {The paper presents the application of two nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approaches: quasi-infinite-horizon nonlinear MPC (QIHNMPC) and moving horizon estimator nonlinear MPC (MHE-NMPC) to the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU). A complex dynamic model of the reactor–regenerator–fractionator system is developed and subsequently used in the controller. The novelty of the model consists in that besides the complex dynamics of the reactor–regenerator system, it also includes the dynamic model of the fractionator, as well as a five lumps kinetic model for the riser. Tight control is achieved using the QIHNMPC approach. The MHE-NMPC considers important features of a real-time control algorithm, resulting in a framework for practical NMPC implementation, such as: state and parameter estimation and efficient solution of the optimisation problem. In the NMPC approach, only measurements available in practice are considered, whereas the rest of the states are estimated together with uncertain model parameters, via MHE technique. Using an efficient numerical implementation based on the multiple shooting algorithm real-time feasibility of the approach is achieved. The incentives of the proposed approaches are assessed on the simulated industrial FCCU.},

However, only a few kinetics published in literature rely on wide temperature and pressure ranges, which are prevalent at modern methanation applications with dynamic operation. Especially the simulation-based design of methanation processes with commercial catalysts is difficult due to legal restrictions regarding the publication of kinetic data of those catalysts. In this work, rate equations for the dynamic modeling and simulation of methanation processes operating with commercial Ni/Al2O3 catalysts are selected, adapted, and tested in a dynamic reactor model. The results suggest that the catalyst's nickel content is an indicator for the choice of a rate equation. Testing of the equations in a reactor model meets published data for CO and CO2 methanation and own measurements.},

Studies based on first (HIPWIND) and second order (HIGHER UPWIND) interpolation schemes were carried out. The difference in the results using the two schemes was found to be negligible. The Computational Fluid Dynamic Technique (CFD) was adopted as a tool to predict downer reactor dynamic, comparing the proposed model with experimental data available in the literature. Good agreement between experimental data and model predictions was verified. Therefore CFD techniques proved to be a powerful tool to predict the fluid dynamic of inlet changing of downer reactors, and it can be used with success in chemical process optimization.},

  abstract      = {The passive-acoustic measurement of bubbly flows could potentially deliver data useful to many industrial and environmental applications. However, acoustic interactions between bubbles complicate interpretations of measured frequencies in terms of the bubble sizes that are of practical interest. Experiments were undertaken on the emissions of a bubble chain when a just-formed bubble at one end of the chain created a sound pulse. This is an idealised paradigm for many applications. The chain was a one-dimensional line of bubbles fixed with known bubble sizes and inter-bubble spacings. Frequencies naturally emitted by the chain were measured for various bubble sizes and spacings, including cases such that the bubbles were close to touching. Semi-empirical fits were found relating the bubble size and number to the lowest and highest-measurable peak frequencies. It was found that all data collapsed onto two curves, one for the lowest-peak and one for the highest-peak frequency. This was confirmed by running numerical simulations for wider ranges of parameters than available experimentally. The results suggest that for a bubble chain, measurements of two peak frequencies could be used to determine the bubble size and also the number of interacting bubbles.},

In this modelling study, baffled logpile structures are proposed as a promising candidate to exploit this potential, by shaping the catalytic material as a static mixer, generating cross-flow. An OpenFOAM Computational Fluid Dynamics study was performed on various 2D structure designs to map the trade-off between heat transfer, pressure drop and residence time distribution as a function of the design, length and gap spacing of the baffle. It is observed that structures with the longest baffles provide optimal heat transfer performance, and that the baffle gap spacing can be used to tailor the trade-off between heat transfer and pressure drop. In comparison to a packed bed filled with spherical particles, the novel structures offer a heat transfer rate four to six times as high at the same pressure drop. Whilst full 3D simulations, validated by experiments, remain to complete the analysis, the current work illustrates the potential of this novel class of structured catalyst materials for intensified chemical reactors.},

The model captures the main transport–kinetic interactions at both the particle and reactor scale. Two different kinetic models from the literature that either include or neglect the role of solid-state diffusion of oxygen in the catalyst bulk are compared in terms of their impact on overall reactor performance. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a means of defining a macroscopic cell-type model for describing the flow patterns in an industrial-scale gas–solids riser is also described. Predictions for the conversion of n-butane and yield of MAN are presented as a function of selected operating variables, and the impact of the variable model parameters on the predictions is briefly assessed. It is shown that the predictions are particularly sensitive to the kinetic model. The relative importance of the interactions between the chemical kinetics and the hydrodynamics is also highlighted. \textcopyright{} 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract      = {In practical applications of inkjet printing the nozzles in a printhead have intermittent idle periods, during which ink can evaporate from the nozzle exit. Inks are usually multicomponent where each component has its own characteristic evaporation rate resulting in concentration gradients within the ink. These gradients may directly and indirectly (via Marangoni flows) alter the jetting process and thereby its reproducibility and the resulting print quality. In the present work we study selective evaporation from an inkjet nozzle for water-glycerol mixtures. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and numerical simulations, we investigate changes in mixture composition with drying time. By monitoring the acoustics within the printhead, and subsequently modeling the system as a mass-spring-damper system, the composition of the mixture can be obtained as a function of drying time. The results from the analytical model are validated using numerical simulations of the full fluid mechanical equations governing the printhead flows and pressure fields. Furthermore, the numerical simulations reveal that the time-independent concentration gradient we observe in the experiments is due to the steady state of water flux through the printhead. Finally, we measure the number of drop formation events required in this system before the mixture concentration within the nozzle attains the initial (predrying) value, and find a stronger than exponential trend in the number of drop formations required. These results shed light on the complex physiochemical hydrodynamics associated with the drying of ink at a printhead nozzle, and help in increasing the stability and reproducibility of inkjet printing.},

The hydrodynamic behaviour is described and characterised by some specific gas and liquid velocities. Particles are easily fluidized and can be uniformly distributed over the whole height of the column. The effect of parameters like liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, particle loading, particle size, and solid density on gas hold up and effect of gas flow rate, solid density and particle size on solid hold up, energy consumption and minimum fluidization velocity has been studied. At the elevated pressures a superior method for better prediction of minimum fluidization velocity and terminal settling velocities has been adopted. The results have been interpreted with Bernoulli's theorem and Richardson–Zaki equation. Based on the assumption of the gas and liquid as a pretend fluid, a simplification has been made to predict the particle terminal settling velocities. The Richardson–Zaki parameter n0 was compared with Renzo's results. A correlation has been proposed with the experimental results for the three-phase fluidization.},

  abstract      = {Pressure data sampled at sufficiently high frequency (typically 20 Hz or higher) can yield much information about the hydrodynamic state of a fluidized bed. Since part of the pressure waves travelling through large (industrial) fluidized beds is only detectable in a limited area of the bed, pressure measurements need to be performed at several positions to cover the whole bed. We examine these local pressure waves (caused by, e.g., passing bubbles or coalescing bubbles) in a 0.80 m i.d. bubbling fluidized bed of Geldart B particles. Experiments and simulations are performed to determine the intensity decrease as local pressure waves propagate from their origin. A new spectral method is applied to determine the degree of coherence for pressure signals measured at two different positions in a fluidized bed. For a superficial gas velocity of 5umf, local pressure waves can be detected up to a radial distance of about 0.5 m from their origin; this distance is somewhat lower for lower gas velocities. This means that the radial spacing of pressure probes should not exceed 1 m. For large diameter beds with a bed height below 1.5 m, a set of probes at a single level and at several radial positions is sufficient to observe or monitor the dynamic state of the complete bed; the probes should preferably be placed at a height of 30\% to 40\% of the total bed height.},

Two separate reactors, one for air and one for fuel, are used. Oxygen is transferred between the two by means of an oxygen carrier. Since fuel and combustion air never mix, the combustion products, mostly CO2 and H2O, are not diluted with N2. Consequently, a condenser is sufficient to obtain almost pure CO2. In this paper, the opportunity to utilize chemical-looping for H2 production, with CO2 capture, is examined. The focus is on the thermodynamics and layout of a chemical-looping reformer for natural gas, but system integration for cogeneration of electricity has also been considered. It is found that the proposed reformer systems are very interesting and that their expected performances in several cases are considerably better than for the reference system - a steam reformer with CO2 capture by amine scrubbing.},

Also the program calculates the heat transfer coefficient. Besides that, the program predicts the fluidized bed stability and determines the optimum input gas velocity for fluidized beds to achieve the best thermal behavior. The hydrodynamic model is verified by comparing its results with the computational fluid dynamic code MFIX [1].

  abstract      = {Computer-based video imaging techniques were utilized in order to measure the axial and radial components of particle velocity and voidage profiles in the draft tube region of a semi-circular spouted fluid bed coating device. Computer images were obtained using standard RS- 170 video signals ( 30 frames/s) from an image processing board and a CCD variable shutter speed camera. When measuring particle velocities. low shutter speeds of I-2 ms were utilized. Due to rapid motion of particles, the images obtained were blurred streaks several millimeters in length. The length and direction of streaks were proportional to the magnitude and direction of the projected velocity vector. By using dispersed back lighting, the particle velocity images appeared as light streaks on a dark background. Custom software was written in order to automatically search for and to identify bright streaks and calculate particle velocities. The velocity measurements obtained from the software were compared with data taken with a high speed Kodak video system ( 1000 frames/s with a 20-p,s strobe). The results were in close agreement. The video images for analysis of voidage measurements were obtained using the same techniques as for the velocity measurements except with a shutter speed of 0. i ms. The images thus obtained showed the particles to have a dark outer ring with a light center. The search algorithm for identifying particles involved establishing the gray level for nine different locations: eight compass points and a center point. By searching the frame for the presence of particles, and then comparing the gray levels at the circumference and the center of the particle image it was possible to distinguish between in-tbcus and out-of-focus particles. A comparison of the results using the software with those of standard models made with glass beads, and by visually counting the particles, was in close agreement. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Single-velocity formulations are capable of predicting regions of zero particle concentration but are problematic with crossing particle trajectories or compression waves. The multi-velocity formulation described here can account for crossing particle trajectories by splitting the particle-phase into distinct velocity families which are transported separately in the flow. Switching of the particle families at solid boundaries and due to momentum transfer with the gas-phase is conducted in a manner that enforces conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. This numerical method is combined with a parallel block-based adaptive mesh refinement algorithm that is very effective in treating problems with disparate length scales. The block-based data structure lends itself naturally to domain decomposition and thereby enables efficient and scalable implementations of the algorithm on distributed-memory multi-processor architectures. Numerical results are described to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach for predicting gas-particle flows.},

  abstract      = {An estimation of solid particle dynamics through a fluid has been studied. Although traditional computational fluids dynamics models can predict multiphase flow and the interactions between the fluid and solid particles, a high level of accuracy of an appropriate numerical model for this type of difficulty is still in demand. Some researchers examining this problem dedicated their research to the particle motions under the influence of gravity. Therefore, in this study a modern computational fluid dynamic model, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), was proposed to predict the three-dimensional cubic lid-driven cavity flow and combined with the Lagrangian approach on the prediction of solid particles in the range of different density ratios. To solve the term, flow fluid, the mesoscale numerical scheme of the Multi Relaxation Time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method was used to simulate the objects at higher stability. In the present study, the different densities of the particles were considered and the effects of gravity were included in the calculation. The 4th Runge-Kutta method was functioned to determine the effect of an external force on a particle because this method is accurate enough compared to other known numerical schemes. The hard sphere model was used to model particle-particle and particle-wall collisions. The solid particle subtleties determined using a numerical fluid dynamic simulation of LBM showed good agreement with the reputable benchmark results by previous researchers. Furthermore, according to the results, the dependency of the particle trajectories on the magnitude of the density of the particles can be observed. The results revealed the significant effect of collision, drag force, gravity force, and vortex structure on a particle's trajectory. Consequently, the LBM model is suitable for this type of problem, and the proposed model is expected to have a wide range of applications.},

  abstract      = {A turbulent gas–solid suspension upward flow in a vertical pipe is simulated numerically using Eulerian–Lagrangian approach. Particle–particle and particle–wall collisions are simulated based on deterministic approach. The influence of particle collisions on the particle concentration, mean temperature and fluctuating velocities are investigated. Numerical results are presented for different values of loading ratios. The profiles of particle concentration, mean velocity and temperature are shown to be flatter by considering inter-particle collisions, while this effect on the gas mean velocity and temperature is not significant. It is demonstrated that the effect of inter-particle collisions have a dramatic influence on the particle fluctuation velocity. It is shown that the profiles of particle concentration and particle velocity are flattened due to inter-particle collisions and this effect becomes more pronounced with increasing loading ratio. Also, the attenuation of turbulence by inter-particle collisions in the core region of the pipe is increased by increasing loading ratio.},

  abstract      = {Hydrogen, as a primary carbon-free energy carrier is confronted by challenges in storage and transportation. However, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) present a promising solution for storing and transporting hydrogen at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Unlike circular energy carriers such as methanol, ammonia, and synthetic natural gas, LOHCs do not produce by-products during hydrogen recovery. LOHCs only act as hydrogen carriers and the carriers can also be recycled for reuse. Although there are considerable advantages to LOHCs, there are also some drawbacks, especially relative to the energy consumption during the dehydrogenation step of the LOHC recycling. This review summarizes the recent progresses in LOHC technologies, focusing on catalyst developments, process and reactor designs, applications, and techno-economic assessments (TEA). LOHC technologies can potentially offer significant benefits to Australia, especially in terms of hydrogen as an export commodity. LOHCs can help avoid capital costs associated with infrastructure, such as transportation vessels, while reducing hydrogen loss during transportation, such as in the case of liquid hydrogen (LH2). Additionally, it minimises CO2 emissions, as observed in methane and methanol reforming. Thus, it is essential to dedicate more efforts to explore and develop LOHC technologies in the Australian context.},

  abstract      = {The applicability of a fluidized-bed reactor (FBR)-based sulfate reducing bioprocess was investigated for the treatment of iron-containing (40–90 mg/L) acidic wastewater at low (88C) and high (658C) temperatures. The FBRs operated at low and high temperatures were inoculated with cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) originally enriched from arctic and hot mining environments, respectively. Ethanol was supplemented as carbon and electron source for SRB. At 88C, ethanol oxidation and sulfate reduction rates increased steadily and reached 320 and 265 mg/L\'{A}day, respectively, after 1 month of operation. After this point, the rates did not change significantly during 130 days of operation. Despite the complete ethanol oxidation and iron precipitation, the average sulfate reduction efficiency was 35 \AE{} 4\% between days 30 and 130 due to the accumulation of acetate. At 658C, a rapid startup was observed as 99.9, 46, and 29\% ethanol, sulfate, acetate removals, in respective order, were observed after 6 days. The feed pH was decreased gradually from its initial value of 6 to around 3.7 during 100 days of operation. The wastewater pH of 4.3–4.4 was neutralized by the alkalinity produced in acetate oxidation and the average effluent pH was 7.8 \AE{} 0.8. As in the low temperature FBR, acetate accumulated. Hence, the oxidation of acetate is the ratelimiting step in the sulfidogenic ethanol oxidation by thermophilic and psychrotrophic SRB. The sulfate reduction rate is three times and acetate oxidation rate is four times higher at 658C than at 88C.},

  abstract      = {Extraction of lipids from biological tissues is a crucial step in lipid analysis. The selection of appropriate solvent is the most critical factor in the efficient extraction of lipids. A mixture of polar (to disrupt the protein-lipid complexes) and nonpolar (to dissolve the neutral lipids) solvents are precisely selected to extract lipids efficiently. In addition, the disintegration of complex and rigid cell-wall of plants, fungi, and microalgal cells by various mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments facilitate the solvent penetration and extraction of lipids. This review discusses the chloroform/methanol-based classical lipid extraction methods and modern modifications of these methods in terms of using healthy and environmentally safe solvents and rapid single-step extraction. At the same time, some adaptations were made to recover the specific lipids. In addition, the high throughput lipid extraction methodologies used for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based plant and animal lipidomics were discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of various pretreatments and extraction methods were also illustrated. Moreover, the emerging green solvents-based lipid extraction method, including supercritical CO2 extraction (SCE), is also discussed.},

Spodumene can exist in three different polymorphs, namely \ensuremath{\alpha}-, \ensuremath{\beta}-, and \ensuremath{\gamma}-spodumene. Studies to date confirm that \ensuremath{\alpha}-spodumene, which is the naturally occurring form of spodumene, is refractory to leaching and has to be converted to a more reactive form in which lithium atoms are more accessible to the extraction reagent. So far, calcination at temperatures of around 1000\textdegree{}C prior to extraction is the most promising approach.

Microwave-assisted production of \ensuremath{\beta}-spodumene can be achieved faster and using less energy than heating in a conventional oven. However, some challenges with this approach have been identified.

  abstract      = {Vegetables and fruits contain a variety of bioactive nutrients and non-nutrients that are associated with health promotion. Consumers currently demand foods with high contents of healthy compounds, as well as preserved natural taste and flavour, minimally processed without using artificial additives. Processing alternatives to be applied on plant-based foodstuffs to obtain beverages are mainly referred to as classical thermal treatments that although are effective treatments to ensure safety and extended shelf-life, also cause undesirable changes in the sensory profiles and phytochemical properties of beverages, thus affecting the overall quality and acceptance by consumers. As a result of these limitations, new non-thermal technologies have been developed for plant-based foods/beverages to enhance the overall quality of these products regarding microbiological safety, sensory traits, and content of bioactive nutrients and non-nutrients during the shelf-life of the product, thus allowing to obtain enhanced health-promoting beverages. Accordingly, the present article attempts to review critically the principal benefits and downsides of the main non-thermal processing alternatives (High hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, ultraviolet light, and ultrasound) to set up sound comparisons with conventional thermal treatments, providing a vision about their practical application that allows identifying the best choice for the sectoral industry in non-alcoholic fruit and vegetable-based beverages.},

  abstract      = {Economic processing of lignocellulosic biomass requires handling the biomass at high solids concentration. This creates challenges because concentrated biomass behaves as a Bingham-like material with large yield stresses. Here we employ torque rheometry to measure the rheological properties of concentrated lignocellulosic biomass (corn stover). Yield stresses obtained using torque rheometry agree with those obtained using other rheometric methods, but torque rheometry can be used at much larger solids concentration (weight fractions of insoluble solids greater than 0.2). Yield stresses decrease with severity of hydrolysis, decrease when water-soluble polymers are added (for nonhydrolyzed biomass), and increase with particle length. Experimental results are qualitatively consistent with those obtained from particle-level simulations.},

The study here presented proposes a method for emulsification of carnauba wax by an in-situ imidization reaction of ammonolysed styrene (maleic anhydride), resulting in the encapsulation of the wax into stabilized organic nanoparticles. A parameter study is presented on the influences of wax concentrations (30 to 80 wt.-\%) and variation in reaction conditions (degree of imidization) on the stability and morphology of the nanoparticles. Similar studies are done for encapsulation and emulsification of paraffin wax as a reference material. An analytical analysis with Raman spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy indicated different reactivity of the waxes towards encapsulation, with the bio-based carnauba wax showing better compatibility with the formation of imidized styrene (maleic anhydride) nanoparticles. The latter can be ascribed to the higher functionality of the carnauba wax inducing more interactions with the organic nanoparticle phase compared to paraffin wax. In parallel, the thermal and mechanical stability of nanoparticles with encapsulated carnauba wax is higher than paraffin wax, as studied by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analysis. In conclusion, a stable aqueous emulsion with a maximum of 70 wt.-\% encapsulated carnauba wax was obtained, being distributed as a droplet phase in 200 nm organic nanoparticles.},

Many efforts are being made to produce hydrogen with zero CO2 footprint via water electrolysis powered by renewable energies. Nevertheless, the use of fossil fuels is essential in the short term. The conventional coal gasification and steam methane reforming processes for hydrogen production are undesirable due to the huge CO2 emissions. A cleaner technology based on natural gas that has received special attention in recent years is methane pyrolysis. The thermal decomposition of methane gives rise to hydrogen and solid carbon, and thus, the release of greenhouse gases is prevented. Therefore, methane pyrolysis is a CO2-free technology that can serve as a bridge from fossil fuels to renewable energies.},

  abstract      = {Abstract             Shear stress measurements were obtained in the standpipe of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) for 230-\ensuremath{\mu}m coke breeze particles under a variety of flow conditions. These data were combined with incremental gas-phase pressure drop readings, and an estimate of the bed weight to predict the solids-phase pressure drop. It was determined that the wall shear stress and solids-phase pressure drop are significant portions of the momentum balance and cannot be neglected when modeling frictional flow behavior of Geldart type B powders in a standpipe using the conservation of linear momentum. The combined magnitude of the axial solids-phase pressure drop and wall shear stress exceeded 48\% of the total forces in the mixture momentum balance for a standpipe. However, tests indicated that the influence of the wall shear stress and axial solids pressure in the mixture momentum balance may be assumed to be negligible once minimum fluidization has been exceeded. Under packed standpipe flow conditions most literature applications treat the wall shear stress as being directly proportional to the axial solids pressure divided by a proportionality factor that does not change with solids flow rate. This assumed constant is the product of the Janssen coefficient and coefficient of friction or the stress ratio. However, shear stress measurements indicated that this proportionality factor experienced a large monotonic decrease from conditions of incipient flow, where it was at its maximum, to conditions of high volumetric fluxes, where it approached a much smaller constant value. Two packed-bed flow regimes were identified. They are the smooth flow regime, characterized as spanning from moderate to large solid volumetric flow rates, and a stick-slip regime characterized as spanning from incipient to moderate solid volumetric fluxes. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2005},

No systematic modelling efforts have been reported to interpret the cavitation performance of these vortex based devices for cavitation. It is essential to develop a modelling framework for describing performance of cavitation reactors. We have addressed this need in the present work. A comprehensive modelling framework comprising three layers: per – pass performance models (overall process), computational fluid dynamics models (flow on reactor scale) and cavity dynamics models (cavity scale) is developed. The approach and computational models were evaluated using the experimental data on treatment of acetonecontaminated water. The presented models were successful in describing the experimental data using initial cavity size as an adjustable parameter. Efforts were made to quantify optimum operating conditions and scaleup. The developed approach, models and results will provide useful design guidelines for pollutant degradation using vortex based cavitation reactors. It will also provide a sound and useful basis for comprehensive multiscale modelling of hydrodynamic cavitation reactors.},

  abstract      = {Phenols are recalcitrant compounds that constitute the majority of organic contaminants in industrial wastewaters. Their removal at large scales require a combination of various processes to reach the desired discharge quality. An extensive body of work has already been published in the area of phenol removal from wastewater, however none of them have focussed on a truly `sensible' approach for coupling advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Rather, a higher removal efficiency was targeted by unduly complicating the process by combining multiple AOPs. The most influential AOP as the primary method typically driven by the nature of the pollutant should form the basis for a hybrid AOP followed by a complementary AOP to intensify the oxidation process. This strategy is lacking in current literature. We address this knowledge gap directly by systematically identifying the best hybrid process for ZnO mediated photocatalysis of phenol. Either a cavitation mediated pre-treatment of ZnO or cavitation-photocatalysis-peroxide based hybrid AOP was investigated. While the pre-treatment approach led to {$>$}25\% increase in phenol oxidation compared to bare ZnO photocatalysis, the hydrodynamic cavitation-photocatalysis-peroxide based system was found to have a cavitational yield 5 times higher than its acoustic cavitation counterpart. A new phenomenon known as the `pseudo staggered effect' was also observed and established in hydrodynamic cavitation mediated photocatalysis-peroxide hybrid process for the first time. While we demonstrated that cavitation is a truly `sensible' choice to enhance photocatalysis, the nature of the pollutant under investigation must always be the key driver when designing such hybrid AOPs.},

  abstract      = {Applying parametric models on time series of pressure fluctuations recorded in a fluidized bed, this paper shows that the bed dynamics can be expressed in analogy with a mechanical system of a certain degree. Thus, the pressure signal is assumed to be an output of a linear time-invariant system driven by a forcing function. The forcing function represents a number of apparently random events (e.g. formation of bubbles at the air-distributor, bubble eruptions at the surface of the bed) and may thereby be approximated as white noise. Parametric models are advocated for characterization of the dynamics of fluidized beds when, for various reasons, long data records are not available or when the quality of the recorded signal is poor. An autoregressive model (AR) of the time series is proposed, and it is shown that the order of the model identifies a mechanical equivalent of certain fluidization behaviour. The model is applied to four fluidization time series, previously investigated. The result indicates that fluidized beds behave like single second-order systems or multiple higher-order mechanical systems acting in parallel. Parametric methods are also used for estimation of power spectra of pressure fluctuations. The information obtained is presented in the form of Bode plots to accentuate the behaviour of fluidized beds as linear dynamical systems. The results are compared with the corresponding information obtained by nonparametric methods, now predominantly used. Data requirements (number of samples, sampling frequency) for the use of parametric models are discussed.},

The bed was operated with Group B solids and with an air-distributor pressure-drop similar to that often applied under industrial conditions. The simulations and experiments are compared through power spectral density distributions of pressure fluctuations in the bed and air plenum. This work focuses on the inlet boundary conditions of the numerical simulations, i.e., the purpose is to include a representation of fluctuations in pressure and flow in the air-supply system. The fluctuations are computed and coupled with the simulations of the flow field in the bed and the air plenum, based on an Eulerian approach. Parametric models are employed for spectral estimates as the time consumption for the threedimensional simulation limits the length of the pressure time series. The simulations provide satisfactory agreement with experiments, and it is seen that, under certain conditions, there is a strong interaction between the fluidized bed and the air-supply system in the form of pressure waves, as well as pressure and flow pulsations from the air-supply system, which propagate through the entire system. It is demonstrated that for such a system, the assumption of a uniform inlet gas flow over the air distributor, assumed in most previous fluidized-bed studies, is not appropriate. This study demonstrates the importance of further development of numerical models for simulating the hydrodynamics of fluidized beds, in particular for industrially sized units.},

The type of information resulting from various ways of measuring the pressure in fluidized beds is discussed, as well as the use of absolute versus differential pressure probes.

To study the dynamic characteristics of heterogeneous binary mixture of irregular particles, several experiments have been carried out with varying tapered angles and composition of the mixtures with various particles. The tapered angle of the bed has been found to affect the characteristics of the bed. Models based on dimensional analysis have been proposed to predict the critical fluidization velocity and maximum bed pressure drop for gas–solid tapered fluidized beds. Experimental values of critical fluidization velocity and maximum bed pressure drop compare well with that predicted by the proposed models and the average absolute errors are well within 15\%.},

  abstract      = {Predicting the thermal and environmental performances of combustion systems can be difficult and computationally expensive. Chemical Reactor Networks (CRN) represent an appealing solution for performing faster numerical simulations since they can carry out calculations with detailed kinetics in a significantly reduced amount of time. However, the design of such models is challenging, as it usually requires a considerable amount of expertise from the user. In this work, we present a novel, automatic methodology for the design of CRN models, which consists of the post-processing of CFD data via a combination of unsupervised clustering and graph scanning algorithms. The methodology was tested on a semi-industrial furnace which can operate in Moderate or Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion. The furnace operates at a nominal power input of 15~kW and is fed with several CH4-H2 mixtures, with two different air injector diameters. First, RANS simulations of the different cases were performed and validated against experimental data. Subsequently, different CRNs were extracted singularly for each case and simulated using detailed kinetics mechanisms. The different CRNs showed good performances in predicting NO emissions for the entire range of cases, as the results were in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Last, the capability of a single CRN to extrapolate towards different operating conditions was also assessed by using one single CRN for the simulation of different fuel mixtures. The approach showed a good level of generalization since the NO predictions were close to the experimental values.},

For the first time, we simulate zinc shape-change during battery cycling by modeling convection of zinc solids. We validate our model with in-situ tomography of commercial button cells. Two-dimensional volume-averaged simulations of cell voltage and zinc electrode morphology during discharge agree with these measurements. Thus, we can study how electrolyte carbonation limits shelf-life and how zinc shape-change limits cycle-life. The charging current is found to be the major contributor to cycle-life limitations. Finally, we optimize initial anode structure and charge-discharge protocols for improved performance and cycle-ability.

TES integrated with coal fired power plant can improve the efficiency, making the power generator responsive to ramp rate. The parallel models were developed in IDAES, an open-source code developed by the Department of Energy (DOE), and Aspen Plus V.10 by Aspen Technology, Inc., which is used in many industries to model and optimize a variety of chemical processes. The benefit of using Aspen Plus for coal combustion is its ability to model solids and multiphase fluids that will be present in the various coal and sCO2 power cycles. The property database and equations of state (EOS) available in the Aspen and IDAES software provide accurate results for the process conditions present in the cycles involved in this project.A baseline model was selected from DOE studies and compared against results from the system modelling. Current results from the model are close to those found using Aspen and those in the baseline model. The system model was also connected to a dual-media thermocline thermal energy storage system (DMTES) that uses a Python script to determine temperatures of molten salt provided by the DMTES. The code uses variables of heat flow, mass flow, and temperature to determine the performance of the sCO2 power block IDAES model. From this, the power block output is determined for steady state and quasi steady state conditions. The DMTES system is modeled for dynamic situations and is shown to have near-constant temperature during charge or discharge, depending on the position of the DMTES system thermal transition zone. The results show how temperature is maintained across a large range of state-of-charge.},

  abstract      = {The conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO) over a zeolite catalyst is used as an example for the investigation of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor/regenerator system. A lumped-species reaction scheme has been developed which accounts for the most relevant components. Kinetic experiments were carried out in a standardfixed-bed Berty reactor over the 400\textdegree{}C to 500\textdegree{}C range at atmospheric pressure. The MT0 process was performed in a circulating fluidized bed (riser dimensions: internal diameter 0.03 m, height 11 m) that is coupled with a regenerator for continuously burning off the coke deposits. Conversion of more than 98\% and a very high olelin selectivity have been achieved. Based on the estimated kinetic parameters and on a CFF3 reactor model, methanol conversion and product distribution is predicted and compared with experimental data. The agreement is satisfactory for the whole temperature range examined.},

  abstract      = {The grading of assessments that consists of large calculations represents an odious task for educators, as they must verify the correct procedures and algorithms were used as well as ensure that the calculations have been done correctly. For engineering capstone design project assessments, these calculations represent spreadsheets, coding and ancillary calculations that can run to over a hundred pages. There is no meaningful way an educator can properly assess such material in the timeframe given for grading. As such, quantitative tools are needed that enable educators to rapidly evaluate calculation-based assessments. Forensic auditing tools were used here to evaluate calculation-based assessments associated with chemical engineering capstone design projects. These tools analyse how data within sets are presented, the structure of spreadsheets and tables, as well as statistical principles around numbers and their distribution within large data sets. This enables the rapid identification of features within students' assessments that warrant further investigation to establish if the data has been manipulated or calculation errors exist. The analysis demonstrated that chemical engineering students' reports can be analysed by forensic auditing tools. Furthermore, these tools identified student errors and misconduct, based on abnormal results highlighted by the analysis, which were not discovered during the standard grading procedure. Applying forensic auditing tools enable a rapid approach to verify engineering students reports submitted for grading. This approach will reduce the time burden on educators, enabling them to focus on ensuring the correct design equations and procedures have been applied.},

  abstract      = {The selective oxidation of ethene over a silver on \ensuremath{\alpha}-alumina catalyst was studied in a pilot plant with a wall-cooled tubular packed bed reactor. Gas and solid temperatures in the catalyst bed were measured at different axial and radial positions as well as concentrations at different axial position. Total pressure, inlet mole fraction ethene, mass flow rate and wall temperature were varied. The experiments are compared with model calculations. A pseudo-homogeneous model and a heterogeneous two-dimensional model were used for the calculations. Kinetics and heat transport parameters in the model have been determined independently in separate studies. The work is distinctive in the accuracy paid to a large number of experimental details. The models correspond reasonably well with the experiments at all operating conditions. The main problem in the description of the reactor is the inability of the kinetic expressions to predict the reaction rates over the entire range of partial pressures. As a result some systematic deviations are found, in particular in the predicted temperature profiles. The heterogeneous model gives better agreement with the experiments although systematically larger temperature differences are calculated on the basis of available correlations in literature than has been measured. On the basis of this work it is difficult to determine directly whether an influence of chemical reaction is present on the values of the heat transport parameters.},

The method is based on the observation that the noise induces a bias in the observed distances of trajectories, which tend to appear farther apart than they are. Under the assumption of noise being strictly bounded in amplitude, this leads to a rescaling of interpoint distances on the attractor. A correlation integral function is obtained that accounts for this effect of noise. The applicability of the method is illustrated with two examples, viz., the Lorenz attractor with additive noise and experimental time series of pressure fluctuation data measured in gas-solid fluidized beds.},

These are neglected in present-day mathematical models designed to describe the reactor behavior. The amplitude of these variations was determined experimentally as a function of the mass flux and the position in the tube, under conditions of heat transfer as well as of reaction. Angular variations are significant whenever radial temperature gradients are large. Different methods used to average observed variations were surveyed. For the system presented, the angular variations have only a limited influence on the reaction rates if the angular averaged temperature is used. Thus, a two-dimensional deterministic continuum model can be used, notwithstanding the statistical character of the packed bed.},

  abstract      = {The kinetics of the selective oxidation of ethene in air over an industrial silver on \ensuremath{\alpha}-alumina catalyst were studied. Special attention was paid to the influence of the reaction products on the reaction rates of epoxidation and complete combustion. Kinetic data were obtained in two different types of internal recycle reactor and in a cooled tubular reactor, and were fitted separately to several reaction rate expressions based on different kinetic models. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which adsorbed ethene reacts with adsorbed molecular oxygen, was chosen as the best kinetic model. The reaction products compete for adsorption on the active sites and reduce the rates of both reactions. Carbon dioxide enhances the selectivity towards ethene oxide, whereas water has almost no influence on the selectivity. The fitting of the three individual data sets obtained in the three reactors results in accurate, but different, reaction rate expressions, whereas the fitting of the three data sets simultaneously results in less accurate reaction rate expressions. The systematic deviations found may be explained, to some extent, by differences in the operating regimes in each reactor. The main reason for the deviations is probably the different catalyst activities in the three reactors caused by poisoning. The effect of the addition of products to the feed on the behaviour of the cooled tubular reactor can be described reasonably well by a mathematical model in which the kinetic equations obtained in the laboratory reactors are incorporated. The results of these simulations are sensitive to the kinetics used.},

  abstract      = {Exceptional molecules and materials with one or more extraordinary properties are both technologically valuable and fundamentally interesting, because they often involve new physical phenomena or new compositions that defy expectations. Historically, exceptionality has been achieved through serendipity, but recently, machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation have been widely proposed to accelerate target identification and synthesis planning. In this Perspective, we argue that the data-driven methods commonly used today are well-suited for optimization but not for the realization of new exceptional materials or molecules. Finding such outliers should be possible using ML, but only by shifting away from using traditional ML approaches that tweak the composition, crystal structure, or reaction pathway. We highlight case studies of high-Tc oxide superconductors and superhard materials to demonstrate the challenges of ML-guided discovery and discuss the limitations of automation for this task. We then provide six recommendations for the development of ML methods capable of exceptional materials discovery: (i) Avoid the tyranny of the middle and focus on extrema; (ii) When data are limited, qualitative predictions that provide direction are more valuable than interpolative accuracy; (iii) Sample what can be made and how to make it and defer optimization; (iv) Create room (and look) for the unexpected while pursuing your goal; (v) Try to fill-in-the-blanks of input and output space; (vi) Do not confuse human understanding with model interpretability. We conclude with a description of how these recommendations can be integrated into automated discovery workflows, which should enable the discovery of exceptional molecules and materials.},

Improvements in reaction engineering techniques as applied to electrochemical synthesis, both inorganic and organic, will continue to provide developments in this valuable and important sector of the process industries. Part I provides a classification of electrochemical synthesis reactions in terms of direct and indirect processes, and reviews the application of electrosynthesis in the production of organic and inorganic chemicals. Part II considers the important design factors in the development of electrochemical processes and their limitations. These include aspects of productivity, energy requirements, mass transport, electrode and membrane materials. Part II The final part of this review describes the design of electrochemical reactors used for both organic and inorganic synthesis, to ensure that the electrochemical cell is an efficient and economic unit for industrial use. The designs include reactors which use either two-dimensional or three-dimensional electrodes. Recent examples of the use of such reactors are described. A brief overview of reaction engineering principles is included in the context of both single-phase and two-phase fluid systems.},

  abstract      = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a technology that reduces the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power stations. A nickel supported on -alumina oxygen carrier is investigated in this study, for use in a CLC process. Oxygen carriers with various nickel loadings on alumina are prepared according to the incipient wetness technique. The reactivity and stability of the prepared oxygen carrier samples, during repeated reduction–oxidation cycles, is demonstrated using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation. Pulse chemisorption results show that the dispersion and active crystallite diameter of the nickel particles remain constant over multiple reduction–oxidation cycles, indicating that no agglomeration occurs up to a nickel loading of 20 wt\% supported on alumina. The stability and reactivity of the oxygen carriers, under industrial relevant conditions, are also investigated using the CREC fluidized bed riser simulator. It is observed that a 20 wt\% nickel supported on alumina oxygen carrier is stable under industrial relevant fluidized bed reaction conditions, converting 76\% of methane to carbon dioxide and water vapor, the combustion products. The metal support interaction is assessed by H2 temperature programmed desorption, which shows that the metal-support interaction decreases as more nickel is loaded onto the alumina support.},

  abstract      = {This work presents a steady-state one-dimensional model of the FCC riser considering the vaporisation of the gas oil feed and subsequent cracking reactions. The evaporation of droplets is studied using three models: the classical homogeneous model and the heterogeneous vaporisation models from the literature. Droplets are modelled using the Lagrangian framework model for particles moving through a fluid. This was coupled with the gas–solid flow field describing the catalyst particulate transport in the riser. Cracking reaction kinetics are modelled using a four-lumped model. The model was then validated against published plant data. The model performed well in terms of gas oil conversion, gasoline yield, pressure drop, and phase temperature profiles. Therefore, it is suitable for use in the design and optimisation of new and existing FCC unit risers, particularly in cost–benefit analysis considering the current push away from petroleum energy sources. It was found that vaporisation models are largely insignificant in terms of gas oil conversion profiles and gasoline yield for usual operation conditions of FCC risers, which is a finding that had yet to be proven in the literature. Vaporisation models are shown to only affect conversion and yield when the initial droplet exceeds 2000~\ensuremath{\mu}m.},

  abstract      = {The performance of model predictive controllers (MPCs) strongly depends on the precision of the prediction model. Nonlinear systems, such as neutralization reactors, provide special challenges to MPC design. Linear prediction models may be inadequate to describe the process at all operating points. One alternative is the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as prediction models. ANNs are nonlinear structures that can be trained to reproduce the process behavior. Inside MPC schemes, ANNs can rapidly predict the process response to a control action. The time-consuming step for ANN training is to obtain a representative overall data set from experiments or simulation data from the studied process. In the present work, we propose to obtain this data set from computational simulations using a first principles model. However, mismatches were found between rigorous simulation and actual pH process responses. Those deviations were naturally transferred to the internal neural model, as a consequence, actual control problems were identified. Avoiding high costs of performing actual experimental runs for ANN and MPC design, we used a real-time adaptation algorithm, based on extended Kalman filter (EKF), that acts to correct the ANN prediction while process is running. The adaptive model ANN-based MPC was able to maintain the actual controlled process, in all operating conditions tested. The sum of square error of pH was reduced in 64.3\%, compared to the ANN-based MPC without model adaptation. Using a Kalman filter to adapt the internal model has significantly improved the MPC performance, reducing oscillations and maintaining the controlled variable in the setpoint, even in servo regulatory situations of industrial practice. In addition, the proposed scheme has great potential for controlling highly nonlinear processes.},

Two different spectral methods are considered, namely Fourier pseudo-spectral method and Chebyshev multidomain spectral method. The pseudo-spectral method is used for the simulation of homogeneous turbulence. DNS of both incompressible and compressible flows with one- and two-way couplings are reported. For LES of particle-laden flows, two new models, developed by the authors, account for the effect of sub-grid fluctuations on the dispersed phase. The Chebyshev multidomain method is employed for the works on inhomogeneous flows. A number of canonical flows are discussed, including flow past a square cylinder, channel flow and flow over backward-facing step. Ongoing research on particle-laden LES of inhomogeneous flows is briefly reported.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we propose the concept of utilizing the heat generated in Generation IV nuclear reactors to produce hydrogen and carbon from methane or natural gas by direct contact pyrolysis, a process that features zero greenhouse gas emissions. Methane or natural gas was bubbled through a bed of either low-melting-point metals (e.g., lead or tin), granular or catalytic materials (e.g., silicon carbide, \ensuremath{\alpha}-alumina, NiMo/\ensuremath{\gamma}-alumina), or a mechanical mixture of molten metal and solid media. The methane conversions were found to be dependent upon the contact time between the methane and the heat transfer media, as well as on the methane bubble size. The most efficient systems used for the pyrolysis process were found to be the ones in which natural gas was bubbled through Mott porous metal filters, in a bed of either 4-in. Sn + SiC or Sn, with the product stream comprised of almost 80 and 70 vol \% of hydrogen at 750 \textdegree{}C, respectively. The main advantage of this proposed system is the ease of buoyant separation of the generated carbon byproduct from the liquid heat transfer media. These experiments lay the groundwork for developing technical expertise in producing pure hydrogen cost-effectively by utilizing the heat energy contained in the liquid metal coolant in Generation IV nuclear reactors.},

  abstract      = {Hydrogen production from catalytic methane decomposition (DeCH4) is a simple process to produce high purity hydrogen with no formation of carbon oxides (CO or CO2). However, to completely avoid those emissions, the catalyst must not be regenerated. Therefore, it is necessary to use inexpensive catalysts, which show low deactivation during the process. Use of carbon materials as catalysts fulfils these requirements. Methane decomposition catalysed by a number of commercial carbons has been studied in this work using both constant and variable temperature experiments. The results obtained showed that the most active catalyst at short reaction times was activated carbon, but it underwent a fast deactivation due to the deposition of the carbon formed from methane cracking. On the contrary, carbon blacks, and especially the CB-bp sample, present high reaction rates for methane decomposition at both short and long reaction times. Carbon nanotubes exhibit a relatively low activity in spite of containing significant amounts of metals. The initial loss of activity observed with the different catalysts is attributed mainly to the blockage of their micropores due to the deposition of the carbon formed during the reaction.},

In the mining and mineral processing industries, these systems are chains of processes with a complex interplay among the equipment, control and processed material. The material properties have natural variations that are usually only known at certain locations. Therefore, we explored a material-oriented approach to digital twins with a particle representation of the granular media. In digital form, the material is treated as pseudo-particles, each representing a large collection of real particles of various sizes, shapes and mineral properties. Movements and changes in the state of the material are determined by the combined data from control systems, sensors, vehicle telematics and simulation models at locations where no real sensors could see. The particle-based representation enables material tracking along the chain of processes. Each digital particle can act as a carrier of observational data generated by the equipment as it interacts with the real material. This make it possible to better learn the material properties from process observations and to predict the effect on downstream processes. We tested the technique on a mining simulator and demonstrated the analysis that can be performed using data from cross-system material tracking.},

Most growth models for microalgae are nonlinear and require experimental measurement of several parameters. The aim of this work is to develop linear practical models for monitoring purposes. A model based on linear coefficients and polynomial features is proposed, balancing interpretability with non-linear representation focusing on model transparency. To simplify the growth model, Taylor series expansion is applied to the Monod and logistic population models. Two scale-specific models are developed and evaluated, offering practical solutions for monitoring microalgae growth in photobioreactors. Therefore, this reduced order representation allows the biomass growth rate to be dependent directly on the biomass concentration. These models do not require exhaustive data collection of substrate concentration over time, making them cost-effective and efficient for industrial applications. This work provides a step forward in photobioreactor modeling, contributing to the sustainable production of microalgae.},

Compared with the conventional single-stage riser FCC, the TSR FCC achieves a higher conversion and significantly improves product distribution and quality. The improved process performance of TSR FCC technology is attributed to catalyst relay and subsection reaction. The TSR FCC can also be a process option for debottlenecking the conventional FCC, which increases throughput capacity up to 30\%.

  abstract      = {In most practical occasion, frost is formed on cold surface which is cooled from the ambient temperature. Although the initial cooling stage may account for a small proportion in the whole frosting process, the effects of the initial cooling on frosting characteristics could not be overlooked. In this paper, a semi-empirical model of cryogenic frosting involving the initial cooling process under forced convection is established by employing frost properties correlations and heat and mass balance analysis. The frost thickness calculated by the proposed semi-empirical model showed good agreement with experimental data within a maximum error of 15 \%. Within the constraints of correlation validity, this model is applicable to conditions where ambient temperatures range from 10 \textdegree{}C to 30 \textdegree{}C, air flow Reynolds numbers span from 7 \texttimes{} 104 to 1.5 \texttimes{} 105, air humidity varies between 3.5 g/kg and 18 g/kg, and initial cooling durations extend from 15 min to 40 min, and the final wall temperature is decreased to about 80K. The results indicate that frost thickness increases with rising ambient temperature, air humidity, and airflow velocity. Notably, higher rates of frost growth are observed during the initial cooling under conditions of elevated air humidity or increased airflow velocity. The trend in frost mass closely mirrors that of frost thickness, however, a more pronounced increase in frost mass occurs with increasing ambient temperature. Furthermore, extending the duration of initial cooling could accelerate the frost growth rate and cause a higher frost surface temperature.},

  abstract      = {Presently, fast degradation of organic wastewater has been achieved by the synergetic method of hydrodynamic cavitation and H2O2 at a laboratory scale, while the physico-chemical effect, especially the turbulence characteristics on the degradation process remains lacking. This paper presents investigation on the degradation of dyeing wastewater containing methylene blue (MB) under neutral condition, within a vortex-based hydrodynamic cavitation (VBHC) reactor. Operating conditions are firstly optimized and then used to collaborate with H2O2 to study the synergetic effects of this hybrid treatment method. The turbulence characteristics are subsequently obtained by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, and the correlation between them and the degradation process of MB is revealed. The results indicate that the highest degradation rate of 91.95\,\% is achieved under optimal conditions. Higher inlet pressure (4.5\,bar) owns the thickest vapor volume fraction, greatest vapor transfer rate, and largest size of cloud cavity in the vortex core region, indicating the strongest cavitation intensity; meanwhile, moderate solution temperature (30 ℃) also favors for the greatest cavitation intensity inside the reactor. The optimal cavitation intensity activates the considerable production of reactive oxygen species, and results in good consistency with the MB degradation performance, which predominately occurs in the annular region around the vortex rope. This research unveils the rationale behind the physical essences of the VBHC process and its influence on the degradation efficacy of MB, which can provide reliable guidance for further development of cavitational reactors to degrade organic pollutants by the VBHC/H2O2 hybrid treatment method.},

  abstract      = {In the present work, a model has been developed for predicting the cavitational intensity in a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor based on the use of orifice plates considering the hydrodynamic conditions and the different chemical reactions taking place inside the cavity. The model is based on a set of ordinary differential equations and considers the bubble hydrodynamics and heat exchange including the phase change. It also accounts for the chemical reactions of the various gaseous species in the air–water system and diffusion/dissolution of the reaction products from the cavity. Weber number criterion has been incorporated for the stability of the growing bubble. During rapid bubble collapse a large amount of water vapor is trapped inside the bubble, resulting in an increased heat capacity and endothermic chemical reactions leading to lower temperatures at the end of the collapsing event. Analyzing the reaction thermodynamics within the dense, collapsed bubble, it can be said that the effect of excluded volume of the non-ideal gas results in pronounced suppression of the molecule-producing endothermic reactions using Le-Chatelier's principle. Design correlation in terms of cavitational intensity (in terms of collapse pressure and temperatures) and cavitational yield (in terms of OH radicals) aims at understanding the design information related to the dependency of the cavitational intensity and the radical yield on the operating parameters in the case of the hydrodynamic cavitation.},

  abstract      = {Plasma pyrolysis is emerging as a very attractive approach for safe disposal of bio-medical wastes worldwide. In this process, the plasma arc plays a vital role for achieving the desired high temperature of \textasciitilde 1000~\textdegree{}C in primary chamber before the waste is fed into this chamber and the waste is decomposed without generating any toxic molecules and by-products. This technology has been indigenously developed at the Facilitation Centre for Industrial Plasma Technologies (FCIPT), Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), having a capacity of processing around 50~kg biomedical waste per hour. The transfer of heat from plasma arc to inner volume of the primary chamber predominantly takes place through radiation and it is further aided by convective heat transfer by nitrogen gas flowing around the arc. Transient CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) simulation has been performed using the commercially available CFD tool ANSYS CFX to determine the temperature and its comparison with experiment. Currently only a preheating analysis without the introduction of waste or any chemical reaction has been performed. This would assist in designing a high capacity (200~kg/h or more) plasma pyrolysis system by validating the methodology and assumptions used in this study. The study has provided information on temperature distribution, heat loss, energy balance, etc. during the pre-heating stage of primary chamber. The CFD results are found to be within a comparable range ({$<$}20\% for inner surface and {\$<\$}10\% for outer surface) for most of the duration of the experiment. The reasons for deviation have also been discussed in the paper.},

Lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly used rechargeable batteries in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and E-vehicles. Li-ion batteries have limitations like less power density, high cost, non-environment friendly, flammable electrolytes, poor cycle performance, etc. Supercapacitors have high power density, and long cycle life but lesser energy density and high self-discharge rate. High-performance, smart, next-generation rechargeable batteries like Zn ion, Li-air, Li-S, Na-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid capacitors can be a good alternative to traditional Lithium-cobalt batteries. In this review article, we focussed on different energy storage devices like Lithium-ion, Lithium-air, Lithium-Zn-air, Lithium-Sulphur, Sodium-ion rechargeable batteries, and super and hybrid capacitors. Emphases are made on the progress made on the fabrication, electrode material, electrolyte, and economic aspects of different electrochemical energy storage devices. Different challenges faced in the fabrication of different energy storage devices and their future perspective were also discussed.},

  abstract      = {Turbulence in wall-bounded flows shows a wide range of regimes, where the interaction between scales significantly occur. Reynolds number is used to characterize the dynamics of fluid corresponding to single phase channel flows. Meanwhile, different flow behavior exists in curved channels even at fixed Reynolds number, where the curvature varies as shown by Brethouwer [``Turbulent flow in curved channels,'' J. Fluid Mech. 931, A21 (2022)]. In the present study, we show how wall-bounded turbulent flow behaves on sharply bending the channel by investigating the time averaged velocity profiles at the straight section, at the bend, and in the inclined section. The well-known logarithmic behavior of the time averaged normalized velocity profile is retained, where the von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n and the additive constants assume altered values depending on the sharp bend inclination. The near-wall fluctuations at the bend are enhanced, which is due to diffusion of counter-rotating vortices leading to increased turbulent activity. In terms of spatial structure of the random fluctuating field, the two-point correlation statistics suggest that multiple high speed and low speed streak pairs are generated, and there are multiple streamwise vortices of different sizes when bend inclination is increased. Budgets of turbulent kinetic energy are presented for various inclinations of the bend at different sections of the bend channel, which depicts that turbulent kinetic energy is modulated at the bend.},

The proposed method possesses a unique capability: it seamlessly integrates SciML into UQ and vice versa, which allows it to quantify the uncertainties in SciML tasks effectively and leverage SciML for improved uncertainty assessment during UQ-related tasks. The proposed surrogate model can effectively incorporate a variety of physical constraints, such as governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with associated initial and boundary conditions constraints, inequality-type constraints (e.g., monotonicity, convexity, non-negativity, among others), and additional a priori information in the training process to supplement limited data. This ensures physically realistic predictions and significantly reduces the need for expensive computational model evaluations to train the surrogate model. Furthermore, the proposed method has a built-in uncertainty quantification (UQ) feature to efficiently estimate output uncertainties. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to a diverse set of problems, including linear/non-linear PDEs with deterministic and stochastic parameters, data-driven surrogate modeling of a complex physical system, and UQ of a stochastic system with parameters modeled as random fields.},

  abstract      = {Turbulence is composed of eddy motions that have excitations over a continuous range of scales and display various spatially localized processes such as turbulence production, diffusion, and dissipation. The complexity of turbulence manifests in both its scale distribution and its complex dependence on physical conditions. We propose a system approach for the study of turbulence that comprises two parts, a scaling analysis that gives rise to a set of local statistical measures for the quantification of the fluctuation state, and a system analysis that determines the spatial variation of scaling over the entire domain of the flow. In this paper, we present the basis for the approach, which is the existence of a hierarchical similarity (HS) property that holds for a variety of turbulent systems. Three systems will be discussed: a mixing layer flow of fluid motions, a chemical reaction system modelled by the complex Ginzburg–Landou equations displaying two-dimensional spiral and chaotic patterns, and DNA sequences that record long-term evolutionary history of biological species. All three systems have a continuous range of fluctuations across scales, and all display the HS property which then holds as the universal principle of the self-organization. It is proposed that the parameters derived from the HS study can be used for the description of local ensemble of turbulent structures, and their spatial variations form a new set of statistical measures of turbulence. Future study involving the measurement of the nonlinear response of the ensemble of eddies to external factors is discussed at the end.},

Rather than relying on obscure formulas that only apply to very specific statistical tests, this book teaches readers how to perform statistical tests via resampling; this is a simple and general approach to conducting statistical tests using simulations that draw samples from the data being analyzed. The statistical techniques and tools are explained and demonstrated using a diverse collection of data sets to conduct statistical tests related to contemporary topics, from the effects of socioeconomic factors on the spread of the COVID-19 virus to the impact of state laws on firearms mortality. This book can be used as an undergraduate textbook for an Introduction to Data Science course or to provide a more contemporary approach in courses like Engineering Statistics.

We theoretically derived the interfacial measurement theorem relating the local instantaneous interfacial velocity to local measurable velocities of the multi-sensor probe in the improvement. Based on this theorem, theoretical measurement methods for the local instantaneous interfacial normal direction and the local time-averaged interfacial area concentration (IAC) using the four-sensor probe were presented. An interface-pairing signal-processing scheme was proposed to identify the same interfaces from the sequential signals detected by different sensors. The practical application of the improved IAC methodology to the two-phase flow in a vertical large diameter pipe showed that the four-sensor probes (together with the interface-pairing signal-processing scheme) could effectively measure the local time-averaged IACs with high effective interface percentages not only in the one-dimensional two-phase flow but also in the multi-dimensional two-phase flow. The measurement error analysis indicated that the errors from the bubble deformation and velocity variation due to the sensor piecing were negligible if we only applied the multisensor probe to the two-phase flow with the bubbles having much larger size than the sensor diameter. The total error from both the escaped and missing bubbles in the void fraction and IAC measurements was estimated at about 15.75\% in the two-phase flow in a pool.},

  abstract      = {Water–gas flow in heterogeneous porous media is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. A pore-scale investigation can help to understand the mechanisms of water–gas flow. This study employs a direct simulation method to model the immiscible water–gas flow while tracking the phase interface via the phase-field method. We first verified the mathematical model by layered two-phase flow and capillary intrusion tests. Then, the quartet structure generation set was used to generate a heterogeneous porous media, based on which water–gas displacement was simulated. The characteristics of drainage and imbibition displacements were systematically investigated. Results show that the forced imbibition process shows stable displacement due to cooperative filling, yet with local capillary fingering. Capillary valve effects always exist during the process, making the capillary force act as both driving and resistance forces in heterogeneous porous media. Nevertheless, these pore-scale events inhabit the rapid breakthrough in the small pore-throat zone, ensuring the uniform advancement of the interface. During drainage, viscous fingering in the wide pore-throat zone and capillary fingering in the narrow pore-throat zone are simultaneously observed. Compared with the imbibition process, the water–gas front advances faster due to the smaller viscous force of invading fluid. The phase distribution after drainage displacement at different capillary numbers is quite different due to inconsistent flow patterns. Nevertheless, the final phase saturation of the imbibition process under different capillary numbers is similar, but the area of each type is different. For both the imbibition and drainage processes, the larger the capillary number, the higher the final displacement efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4–9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization~outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run.},

  abstract      = {s Over the past few decades, advanced process control (APC) such as model predictive control (MPC) has been introduced to process industry to enhance its operational efficiency. For this, a linear model has been widely used to reduce the computational burden for iterative simulation and optimization over time, but it caused high inaccuracy of the control system. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was adopted instead of using the existing linearized model in order to increase the speed of optimization and accuracy of the model. For a case study, a depropanizer was modeled using Aspen HYSYS, and all feasible operation scenarios were considered to generate massive amounts of dynamic simulation data. Then, the accumulated data was implemented to the ANN for training, and it was tested. Once the verification was completed, the model was incorporated with an optimization algorithm in MPC system. For testing its performance, set point change and introduction of disturbances were applied to the model, and efficiency of the MPC was compared with the conventional control such as PID feedback control. The analysis results showed better performance (i.e., shorter settling time and rise time) of the MPC against the PID control. This methodology can be widely used in various types of control systems in the industry.},

  abstract      = {Modeling particle dispersion in turbulent flows is very complex. Several publications in this field have dealt with both the experimental and modeling aspects of turbulent particle dispersion. This paper gives a broad overview of different modeling techniques discussed in the literature in order to describe the problem of particle dispersion in dilute flows. Unlike other reviews of this subject, this paper maintains a simple approach in explaining mathematically and conceptually the complex issues involved in modeling. Some fundamental concepts, such as key characteristics of turbulent flow and the nature of interaction between turbulence and an individual particle under simplified conditions, are discussed. The authors have attempted to present several definitions (such as homogeneous flow, stationary condition, and integral time scale) that are commonly used to imply certain assumptions or as conceptual tools to derive a model. As indicated, a review of models that are capable of predicting the dispersion of dilute concentration of particles in turbulent flows is presented. The models are described in a simplistic way through use of previously explained ideas and concepts. One of the important practical applications of such dilute twophase flow models deals with the problem of pulverized-coal combustion. The final part of the paper discusses some of the key issues involved in comprehensive pulverized-coal combustion models. The primary objective of this work is to provide a basic understanding of the subject and hence to serve as an introduction to the theoretical world of turbulent particle dispersion.

An axisymmetric tomographic reconstruction algorithm based on the Abel transform has been used to calculate the time-averaged gas holdup radial variation. Integration of these profiles over the column cross section has yielded area-averaged holdup results, which have been compared with volume-averaged gas holdups determined from differential pressure measurements and from the rise in the air/water interface during gas flow.

  abstract      = {Pressure gradients have been measured for vertical flows of slurries of particles with diameters between 1.37 and 3.4 mm in pipes of diameter 26 and 40 mm. By expressing the wall shear stress as the sum of fluid and particle components, the wall stresses for the particles have been evaluated. The stresses increase with particle diameter and density, mean flow velocity and particle concentration. Measurements of the velocity of the particles closest to the pipe wall suggest that considerable distortion of the velocity distribution occurs, compared to that of the clear carrier fluid. The measurements confirm that a region of reduced particle concentration forms at the pipe wall, with coarse particles giving a pronounced change of this type. The wall stresses resemble those discovered by Bagnold for particles sheared in Couette flow. In Bagnold's experiments, wall stresses were found to be strongly dependent on solids concentration. Since the particle concentration at the wall was unknown in the present investigation, a correlation for wall stresses has been obtained in terms of the mean concentration. The correlation can be used to estimate pressure gradients for vertical flows of nearly isometric angular particles.},

Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p {$<$} 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.},

  abstract      = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most important and powerful methods in chemometrics as well as in a wealth of other areas. Running a PCA results in two main elements, the score plot and the loading plot; the score plot provides the location of the samples, and the loading plot indicates correlations among variables, the trends in the grouping of samples, and the most important variables. In the past 10 years teaching chemometrics, we have struggled with not having free software with an easy to use graphical user interface for data handling and calculations. In this paper, we provide a series of examples that students used to carry PCA in R-Project, a free and open source software program. In the first example, students used PCA to find correlations among chemical properties of chemical elements and relate these properties with the periodic distribution of the elements. In the second example, meat samples were grouped using 14 variables, and students could observe how outlier samples might influence the PCA model; in this case, they were also taught how to use the t test to choose the variables that were significant to the PCA model. In the third example, healthy patients were differentiated from diabetic patients using 163 lipid concentrations. In the fourth example, Atlantic salmon samples were differentiated from catfish samples. In the fifth and sixth examples, students were able to observe how data treatment affects the classification of natural products and edible oils, respectively.},

As decarbonization efforts accelerate, CCS can target the emissions of large point-source emitters, such as coal- or natural gas-fired power plants, while also supporting the production of renewable or low-carbon fuels. Furthermore, CCS can enable decarbonization of difficult-to-abate industrial processes and can support net CO2 removal from the atmosphere through bioenergy coupled with CCS or direct air capture. Here we review the development of porous materials as next-generation sorbents for CO2 capture applications.

Scientists have linked the underlying structural or chemical science of textile materials and discovered several strategies for completing some of the most time-consuming tasks with ease and precision. Since the 1980s, computer algorithms and machine learning have been used to aid the majority of the textile testing process. With the rise in demand for automation, deep learning, and neural networks, these two now handle the majority of testing and quality control operations in the form of image processing. Design/methodology/approach The state-of-the-art of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the textile sector is reviewed in this paper. Based on several research problems and AI-based methods, the current literature is evaluated. The research issues are categorized into three categories based on the operation processes of the textile industry, including yarn manufacturing, fabric manufacture and coloration. Findings AI-assisted automation has improved not only machine efficiency but also overall industry operations. AI's fundamental concepts have been examined for real-world challenges. Several scientists conducted the majority of the case studies, and they confirmed that image analysis, backpropagation and neural networking may be specifically used as testing techniques in textile material testing. AI can be used to automate processes in various circumstances. Originality/value This research conducts a thorough analysis of artificial neural network applications in the textile sector.},

Different motion behaviours reflect different microenvironments, activity states, kinetics and interaction partners. Single-particle tracking (SPT) is a powerful method for analysing these behaviours directly and in live cells. However, SPT is confounded by multiple sources of experimental noise and biases. Interpreting tracks in terms of quantitative models thus remains a challenging task. We start this Primer by briefly presenting experimental setups and labelling techniques often employed for SPT, followed by a focus on the variety of tools available for analysing noisy tracks with multiple states. This includes tools designed to identify and characterize state fractions and diffusion coefficients, detect and quantify state transitions, predict the number of states and identify and parameterize various motion behaviours. We then highlight some of the many applications of SPT in cellular biology and discuss the limitations of current methods and what future developments are needed to address the current challenges of the SPT analysis.},

To study the long-range spatial correlation of the particle velocities, a conditional average, for a given fluid turbulent flow, is introduced. This approach allows us to separate the instantaneous velocity of any particle into two parts: a turbulent contribution, from an underlying continuous velocity field shared by all the particles, and a random contribution obeying the `molecular chaos' assumption.},

  abstract      = {The interest in cavitating flow reactors has intensified over recent years, and a significant amount of research effort has been focussed on demonstrating the potential applications of hydrodynamic cavitation. The knowledge base on the design of devices to optimise cavitation yield, performance and industrial scalability remains lacking however. It is essential to develop a sound understanding of the key hydrodynamic characteristics of cavitation devices to address these knowledge gaps. This work presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation into the hydrodynamic behaviour of cavitating devices which feature linear and swirling flows. Two of the most commonly utilized cavitation device geometries are studied, namely orifice and Venturi, with and without swirl. These devices are compared to a high swirl flow device (vortex diode). A series of experimental configurations were designed with the aid of multiphase, unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations, so as to achieve matching power input in terms of flow rate versus pressure drop across all 5 device configurations, allowing their cavitation characteristics to be directly compared on a consistent basis. High speed flow visualisation and detailed numerical predictions are presented which clearly describe the influence that key parameters such as swirl ratio and Reynolds number have on the nature of the observed cavitating flow structures. Cavitation inception conditions are described for each device, with Venturi and vortex devices shown to generate incipient cavitation at lower pressure ratios than orifice devices. Cavitation numbers are computed, which indicate that values of unity are obtained at inception across the range of devices provided that appropriate characteristic velocities are defined. Swirl is identified as an important parameter in cavitation device design, with the swirling flow device designs shown to successfully move the cavitating region away from solid surfaces towards the device axis. Importantly, this is achieved without an energy consumption penalty; the results describe how swirl can be utilized to design devices which minimise or eliminate the risk of surface erosion.},

Recent advances in computation have rendered previously computationally infeasible analyses readily executable on common computer hardware. However, in certain use cases, such as uncertainty quantification or high precision real-time simulation, the computational cost remains a challenge. This necessitates the adoption of reduced-order modelling methods, which can reduce the computational toll of such nonlinear analyses. In this work, we propose a reduction scheme relying on the exploitation of an autoencoder as means to infer a latent space from output-only response data. This latent space, which in essence approximates the system's nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), serves as an invertible reduction basis for the nonlinear system. The proposed machine learning framework is then complemented via the use of long short term memory (LSTM) networks in the reduced space. These are used for creating an nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) of the system, able to recreate the full system's dynamic response under a known driving input.},

Based on the data, empirical correlations were developed using scale-up analysis for predicting pressure-drop, bed porosity and average bed height during cross-flow fluidization apparently prevalent on the stage.

Using the discrete element method approach, the mechanism of cavity size hysteresis in the presence of gas flow has been studied. The modeling results on cavity size have been compared with experiments and show a reasonable agreement. It is found that bed history, interparticle interaction forces, and gas drag all play an important role in the formation of cavities. The bed porosity in the decreasing gas velocity case was always found higher than the increasing gas velocity. The net gas drag at any location above the gas injection point in the bed decreases as the gas velocity is increased. It is also found that the change in interparticle interaction forces with gas flow rate is a major cause of the hysteresis phenomenon.},

The new approach is of the same accuracy as the original approach as is demonstrated by studying mixing in the standard two-dimensional cavity flow. The power of the new approach is that it can easily be implemented to analyze mixing in complex geometries where the original approach fails. This is demonstrated by analyzing mixing in a static Sulzer SMX mixer. To enhance the availability of the mapping method for general users of CFD in commercial packages like Fluent, CFX, Star CD, etc., we finally add an example of an implementation of the new approach in Matlab, applying it to study mixing in a time periodic sine flow (TPSF).},

  abstract      = {Population balance models are tools for the study of dispersed systems, such as granular materials, polymers, colloids and aerosols. They are applied with increasing frequency across a wide range of disciplines, including chemical engineering, aerosol physics, astrophysics, polymer science, pharmaceutical sciences, and mathematical biology. Population balance models are used to track particle properties and their changes due to aggregation, fragmentation, nucleation and growth, processes that directly affect the distribution of particle sizes. The population balance equation is an integro-partial differential equation whose domain is the line of positive real numbers. This poses challenges for the stability and accuracy of the numerical methods used to solve for size distribution function and in response to these challenges several different methodologies have been developed in the literature. This review provides a critical presentation of the state of the art in numerical approaches for solving these complex models with emphasis in the algorithmic details that distinguish each methodology. The review covers finite volume methods, Monte Carlo method and sectional methods; the method of moments, another important numerical methodology, is not covered in this review.},

However, while these models are typically accurate, they are custom-designed for individual systems, making system-to-system (S2S) transferability difficult. This occurs even when substantial similarities exist in the process dynamics across different chemical systems. To address this challenge, we developed a novel time-series-transformer (TST) framework that exploits the powerful transfer learning capabilities inherent in transformer algorithms. This was demonstrated using readily available process data obtained from different crystallizers operating under various operational scenarios. Using this extensive dataset, we trained a TST model (CrystalGPT) to exhibit remarkable S2S transferability not only across all pre-established systems, but also to an unencountered system. CrystalGPT achieved a cumulative error across all systems, which is eight times superior to that of existing ML models. Additionally, we coupled CrystalGPT with a predictive controller to reduce the variance in setpoint tracking to just 1\%.},

  abstract      = {Sono-assisted adsorption process is a clean, resourceful and rapid method for elimination of toxic species from water. Mesoporous zeolite Y (NaY) was synthesized from rice husk ash (RHA), using a three-step technique and then modified with iron using an ion-exchange method. As-synthesized NaY, iron-modified zeolite Y (IMZY), and commercial zeolite Y (CZY) were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The EDX analysis implies the presence of iron in the structure of NaY. The swift sono-assisted adsorption of As(V) from aqueous solution was compared with conventional adsorption in the presence of all three adsorbents: NaY, IMZY, and CZY. The batch sono-adsorption technique was investigated using influenced parameters of solution pH (2-12), adsorbent dose (0.01-1.0 g/ L), sonication time (0-90 min), and initial As(V) concentration (10-50 mg/L), based on the percentage of As(V) removal. The highest removal of As(V) was obtained as 40.31\% by NaY, 99.90\% by IMZY and 41.24\% by CZY. The adsorption isotherms was best fitted with the Freundlich isotherm model, which indicates the multimolecular surface adsorption and pseudo-second-order kinetic model for all three adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacities of NaY, IMZT, and CZY for As(V) were 3.38, 94.51, and 3.34 mg/g, respectively, for 0.5 g/L adsorbents. The batch experimentation results demonstrated that IMZY could be used for swift and effective removal of As(V), which are frequently existing in groundwater. The work also provides a cradle-to-cradle solution to address problematic solid-waste RHA.},

Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model.

A particular feature is the ability to calculate the particle density \textregistered{}eld accurately even in the vicinity of discontinuities, particlefree `shadow' zones and particle separations from solid surfaces. The paper discusses the ill-posedness of the Eulerian equations and describes the numerical scheme, focusing on (i) the particle boundary condition at solid surfaces, (ii) the capture of discontinuities in the particle density \textregistered{}eld, (iii) special techniques to handle shadow zones, (iv) convergence acceleration for particle \textasciimacron{}ows with very small Stokes numbers and, (v) the possibility of crossing particle trajectories. Applications of the method are illustrated by calculations of particle \textasciimacron{}ow over a circular cylinder and through a turbine cascade. The results agree well with the predictions of a computationally more expensive Lagrangian tracking code and the method oers the possibility of extension to include turbulent particle transport. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Laboratory model tests were performed with a mass and funnel flow silo to investigate the kinematics of the flowing sand. The measurements were carried out for granular flow in model silos without inserts and in a funnel flow silo equipped with three different types of inserts: cone-in-cone, inverted cone and double cone. The effect of the initial sand density and roughness of silo walls on the volumetric and deviatoric strain in sand was investigated. The accuracy of measurements was discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of PIV were outlined. The results were qualitatively compared with sand displacements obtained with colored sand layers and with the aid of X-rays (initially dense sand). \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {Practical Process Control (loop tuning and troubleshooting). This book differs from others on the market in several respects. First, the presentation is totally in the time domain (the word "LaPlace" is nowhere to be found). The focus of the book is actually troubleshooting, not tuning. If a controller is "tunable", the tuning procedure will be straightforward and uneventful. But if a loop is "untunable", difficulties will be experienced, usually early in the tuning effort. The nature of any difficulty provides valuable clues to what is rendering the loop "untunable". For example, if reducing the controller gain leads to increased oscillations, one should look for possible interaction with one or more other loops. Tuning difficulties are always symptoms of other problems; effective troubleshooting involves recognizing the clues, identifying the root cause of the problem, and making corrections.  Furthermore, most loops are rendered "untunable" due to some aspect of the steady-state behavior of the process. Consequently, the book focuses more on the relationship of process control to steady-state process characteristics than to dynamic process characteristics. One prerequisite to effective troubleshooting is to "demystify" some of the characteristics of the PID control equations. One unique aspect of this book is that it explains in the time domain all aspects of the PID control equation (including as the difference between the parallel and series forms of the PID, the reset feedback form of the PID equation, reset windup protection, etc.) The book stresses an appropriate P\&I (process and instrumentation) diagram as critical to successful tuning. If the P\&I is not right, tuning difficulties are inevitable. Developing and analyzing P\&I diagrams is a critical aspect of troubleshooting.},

  abstract      = {The residence time distribution (RTD) of solids is essential for the design of CFB reactors where conversion proceeds with time. The residence time distribution for the solids is measured at di!erent working conditions. The resulting average residence times are correlated as function of gas velocity and solids circulation rate and are compared with literature data. In order to predict the RTD of the solids, the solids/gas \#ow is "rstly described by a plug \#ow with dispersion. A "tting procedure gave experimental PeH clet numbers, which were correlated as function of gas velocity and solids circulation rate. A more fundamental approach based on the core/annulus \#ow structure is thereafter used to predict the residence time. The riser is divided in a dilute core with particles \#owing upward and a denser "lm moving slowly downward along the wall. Particle interchange between the two regions is described by a convective interchange \#ow. The model is used to predict experimental RTD-curves. The interchange \#ux between core and annulus corresponds well with radial \#uxes reported in literature. Although the RTD is qualitatively well described, experimental curves show a higher dispersion than the calculated ones. To improve the core/annulus approach, further research is necessary. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This has also resulted in the merging of various disciplines of chemical engineering in formulating detailed descriptions of complex processes. Developments that exemplify this trend over the years are discussed in this review.

In an attempt and based on clinical observations, he explained how three different arterial diseases, namely atherosclerosis, aneurysm and dissection have the same root in malfunctioning Vasa Vasorums (VVs) which are micro capillaries responsible for artery wall nourishment. The authors already proposed a mathematical framework for the modeling of atherosclerosis which is the thickening of the artery walls due to an inflammatory response to VVs dysfunction. A multiphysics model based on a phase-field approach coupled with mechanical deformation was proposed for this purpose. The kinematics of mechanical deformation was described using finite strain theory. The entire model is three-dimensional and fully based on a macroscopic continuum description. The objective here is to extend that model by incorporating a damage mechanism in order to capture the tearing (rupture) in the artery wall as a result of micro-injuries in VV. Unlike the existing damage-based model of the dissection in the literature, here the damage is driven by the internal bleeding (hematoma) rather than purely mechanical external loading. The numerical implementation is carried out using finite element method (FEM).},

Design modifications such as incorporating perforations of varying size and different shapes of serrations are introduced to a standard Sulzer SMX geometry. CFD simulations are performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software to investigate mixing performance in these mixers under laminar flow conditions with an incompressible fluid as a working medium. For dispersive mixing, computational results were compared in terms of velocity field, pressure field, shear rate and extensional efficiency of each type of static mixer. Further, binary cluster particle tracer simulations in the flow domain are performed to compute the distributive mixing capacity of these static mixers which is quantified in terms of the standard deviation. Based on the computational results of both dispersive mixing and distributive mixing, the best modified static mixer geometry is proposed which facilitates significantly improved mixing compared to that of a standard SMX geometry.},

Voidage distributions and solids flow structure were investigated using optical fibre probes in a fluidized bed of FCC. The results show a relatively dense annular region, in which the time-average flow is downwards, surrounding a more dilute, upward flowing core region. However, the radial profiles of voidage indicate that the voidage increases gradually from the wall to the axis of the column, rather than showing a sharp transition between an annular and core region. Particles in the descending outer region are entrained by the feed jets into the core region. The radial position of the boundary between upward and downward net solids flow did not change significantly when the superficial gas velocity was varied.},

  abstract      = {A new pressure drop correlation in a Kenics static mixer has been developed. Pressure drop data were generated from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations, avoiding the experimental limitations in obtaining comprehensive data enough for developing a reliable pressure drop correlation. Dimensional analysis reveals that the pressure drop characteristic of the Kenics static mixer can be described by three dimensionless groups, i.e., the friction factor, Reynolds number (Re), and aspect ratio of a mixing element (AR). A systematic graphical analysis led to a single master curve governing the pressure drop behavior of the Kenics static mixer, which had never been achieved before. We derived a pressure drop correlation fitting well with the obtained master curve in a general form into which the AR effect on the pressure drop is directly incorporated. Unlike the already existing correlations available in the literature, the correlation proposed in this study can cover the whole range of Re from laminar to turbulence. The reliability of the proposed correlation was validated by the comparison with various pressure drop data reported in the literature.},

  abstract      = {Water is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry and life. It is therefore no surprise that the aqueous solubility of compounds has a key role in various domains, including but not limited to drug discovery, paint, coating, and battery materials design. Measurement and prediction of aqueous solubility is a complex and prevailing challenge in chemistry. For the latter, different data-driven prediction models have recently been developed to augment the physics-based modeling approaches. To construct accurate data-driven estimation models, it is essential that the underlying experimental calibration data used by these models is of high fidelity and quality. Existing solubility datasets show variance in the chemical space of compounds covered, measurement methods, experimental conditions, but also in the non-standard representations, size, and accessibility of data. To address this problem, we generated a new database of compounds, AqSolDB, by merging a total of nine different aqueous solubility datasets, curating the merged data, standardizing and validating the compound representation formats, marking with reliability labels, and providing 2D descriptors of compounds as a Supplementary Resource.},

  abstract      = {Product separation and purification is costly but crucial step in chemical production concepts. Lots of information is needed in designing these systems, this is not however always available for first conceptual design. The main focus in this project was on developing competence and readiness to conduct reliably but rapidly conceptual techno-economic assessments of (bio)chemical production processes. The idea was to develop a rapid method and a generic ``short-cut'' model for evaluation of different alternative separation systems mainly for solid-liquid and liquid-liquid systems, but also for gas-liquid and gas-solid systems. The model was created with Balas\textregistered{} simulation software linked with MS Excel. The description of the model is presented in PowerPoint slides, ChemSep – report slides. This document, instead, acts as a theory source for the use of the model. In this document, the classification of separation processes into heterogeneous and homogeneous separation processes is presented, different unit operations of separation are shortly described and the possible application examples are listed. Heterogeneous separation processes that are described in detail include decantation, hydrocyclones, settling, sedimentation, flotation, centrifugal separation, filtration, wet scrubbers, leaching/washing and solid drying. Homogeneous separation processes that are described in detail include flash vaporization, distillation, drying of solutions, evaporation, crystallization and membrane technology. The operational principles, equipment types, selection of appropriate equipment and applications for each above mentioned separation process are described. The theory of the calculation of mass and energy balance in each unit operation are excluded. It can easily be found in the literature. Also, a short chapter of criteria affecting the selection of a suitable separation process for the mixture in question is presented.},

This condition is useful in situations where the ow rate is known, or more importantly, in cases where the pressure gradient is not known a priori, such as in countercurrent ows. Using the present condition, the ow rate is imposed at the inlet in terms of a bulk velocity, but the velocity \"{y}eld evolves as part of the solution. The condition is formulated to be suitable for both \"{y}xed and moving periodic domains. For the case of a moving domain, a correction is introduced to account for changes in the instantaneous velocity through the periodic edges. Under periodic conditions, these corrections integrate to zero over a complete (temporal) period. The new periodic condition is shown to produce accurate results for at and wavy-walled channels under both induced ow and countercurrent conditions. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract      = {This study addresses the computational challenges in fluid flow simulations arising from demanding computational grids, required to capture the temporal and length scales involved. Our approach focuses on the pressure solver, as this is a resource-intensive component in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers. We achieve this by integrating a Machine Learning (ML) surrogate model with an incompressible fluid flow solver. We created two variants of an ML-enhanced CFD solver which were able to reduce the number of iterations required by the CFD pressure solver during unsteady flow simulations. Consequently, the simulations yielded comparable drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers, accompanied by an eightfold decrease in execution time. The performance enhancements are attributed to reduced computational effort per temporal iteration and early-stage forcing on the simulation dynamical behavior when using the ML-based surrogate models. This research introduces an approach to enhance the computational efficiency of fluid flow analyses by incorporating surrogate models to aid the pressure solver in CFD simulations. We propose a Hybrid CFD solver, ie. a physics-informed solver enhanced with data-driven surrogate models.},

Von Karman's study of this classical physics problem showed that the pressure on the bottom surface of the impacting body approaches infinity for flat impacts. Yet, in contrast to the high pressures found from experience and in previous studies, we show that a flat-bottomed cylinder impacting a pool of liquid can decrease the local pressure sufficiently to cavitate the liquid. Cavitation occurs because the liquid is slightly compressible and impact creates large pressure waves that reflect from the free surface to form negative pressure regions. We find that an impact velocity as low as \textasciitilde 3 m/s suffices to cavitate the liquid and propose a new cavitation number to predict cavitation onset in low-speed solid-liquid impact-scenarios. These findings imply that localized cavitation could occur in impacts such as boat slamming, cliff jumping, and ocean landing of spacecraft.},

  abstract      = {The local gas velocity and the intensity of the gas turbulence in a gas/solid flow are a required measurement in validating the gas and solids flow structure predicted by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models in fluid bed and transport reactors. The high concentration and velocities of solids, however, make the use of traditional gas velocity measurement devices such as pitot tubes, hot wire anemometers and other such devices difficult. A method of determining these velocities has been devised at the National Energy Technology Laboratory employing tracer gas. The technique developed measures the time average local axial velocity gas component of a gas/solid flow using an injected tracer gas which induces changes in the heat transfer characteristics of the gas mixture. A small amount of helium is injected upstream a known distance from a self-heated thermistor. The thermistor, protected from the solids by means of a filter, is exposed to gases that are continuously extracted from the flow. Changes in the convective heat transfer characteristics of the gas are indicated by voltage variations across a Wheatstone bridge. When pulsed injections of helium are introduced to the riser flow the change in convective heat transfer coefficient of the gas can be rapidly and accurately determined with this instrument. By knowing the separation distance between the helium injection point and the thermistor extraction location as well as the time delay between injection and detection, the gas velocity can easily be calculated. Variations in the measured gas velocities also allow the turbulence intensity of the gas to be estimated.},

All trials were conducted releasing chlorine through a 15.2 cm (6 in) circular breach in the 9,100 kg (10 T) capacity test vessel (disseminator) at different orientations (vertically downward, 45\textdegree{} below horizontal, and vertically up). A final 18,000 kg (20 T) release was made vertically downward using a truck vessel. This article analyzes disseminator load cell data to determine the mass release rate. Along with this data, previously published data are also considered to quantify the impact on release rate of flash fraction and superheat limit temperature for various materials.

The former is modeled using the kinetic theory of granular materials. For the latter, we begin with the model described by Schaeffer [J. Differ. Equ. 66 (1987) 19] and modify it to account for strain rate fluctuations and slow relaxation of the assembly to the yield surface. Results of simulations of two model problems, namely, the gravity discharge of particles from a bin and the rise of a bubble in a fluidized bed, are presented. The simulations capture the height-independent rate of discharge of particles from the bin, the dilation of particle assembly near the exit orifice, the significant effect of the interstitial air on the discharge behavior of fine particles and the occurrence of pressure deficit above the orifice. However, the stagnant shoulder at the bottom corners of the bin is not captured; instead, one obtains a region of slow flow at the corners. The bubble rise example shows the significant effect of frictional stresses on the bubble shape. In both examples, a simplified version of the rheological model obtained by invoking a critical state hypothesis is found to be adequate.},

  abstract      = {The objective of the present investigation was to test the applicability of particle image velocimetry (PIV), which is normally used for measuring velocities in liquids or gases, to measurement of velocities in granular flow. A second objective was to use PIV to provide experimental data for comparison with mathematical models. The flow of zinc particles, of size 0.4, 0.61 and 0.76 mm size, in a flatbottomed two-dimensional hopper was measured by PIV. The particles were characterized using ASTM procedures for angle of repose, packing density and flow rate through a funnel. Through PIV, velocities and mass flow rates were determined for exit apertures 5 and 7.5 mm in width and 10, 30 and 50 mm long. The bed of particles in the hopper showed the expected stagnant zones on either side of the aperture. There was a continual avalanche of particles at the ``V'' which forms at the surface of the bed and some images of this avalanche, obtained with a boroscope, are included.},

An analysis, based on a theoretical relation derived by HINZE, shows that the main contributions to the pressure drop come from: (1) The static hold-up of solids in the riser. (2) The friction of the solids at the wall. (3) The acceleration of the solids. From this theoretical relation and the experimental data an empirical relationship is established which contains all characteristic variables. The pressure drop across the riser proves not to depend on the viscosity or on the density of the transport gas within the ranges studied (viscosity: l\&37 x 10-B Nsec/m2; density: 0.33-5.0 kg/m3).},

Helium (He) was used as tracer gas, and the local He-concentration was determined by a mass spectrometer. The \#uidisation velocity ranged from 1.2 to 4.3 m/s in the boiler and from 1 to 6 m/s in the cold unit. The bed material was silica sand with an average particle diameter of 0.32 mm in both units. Measurements were also carried out in the bottom bed and splash zone of the boiler for comparison with those of the transport zone. In the cold experimental unit, a greater range of operating conditions could be covered than what was possible in the boiler, including a case without solids. In the core of the transport region of the boiler, there is no backmixing of gas and the horizontal mixing of injected tracer gas is characterised by an axi-symmetric spread of tracer gas around the centre line of injection. The horizontal gas-mixing rate is quanti"ed by a dispersion coe\$cient, which is above 0.01 m /s in the boiler and around 0.005 m /s in the cold unit. The di!erence in dispersion coe\$cients of the boiler and the cold unit is due to the di!erence in size.

  abstract      = {A force balance is derived for a hemispherical particle in the viscous boundary layer at the wall of a horizontal pipe conveying Newtonian uid; the hemisphere, of radius much less than that of the pipe, rests on the bottom with its at face against the wall. The drag on the hemisphere is calculated from the creeping ow \"{y}eld of Price (Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. Pt. 1 (1993)). This yields a prediction of the maximum velocity gradient at the wall for equilibrium, with limiting friction between the hemisphere and the wall. It is shown that the ow \"{y}eld of Price predicts a zero lift force but the validity of this, for actual ows, is questioned. Use of a hemisphere formulates a relevant well-posed problem, capable of mathematical solution. However, the ow \"{y}eld around real particles, e.g. sand, is complex, because of their irregular shapes, but the hemisphere work gives a qualitative indication of the behaviour of irregular particles. For turbulent ow in a pipe it is pertinent to consider a particle wholly within the viscous sub-layer, because it is isolated from signi\"{y}cant turbulence and therefore hard to move; for such ow, the theory gives Eq. (21) to predict the critical pipe velocity, vC , for incipient motion of the hemisphere. For laminar ow, the wall shear rate is readily obtained from the parabolic velocity pro\"{y}le leading to Eq. (26) for vC . The ow \"{y}eld of Price (and therefore the force acting on the hemisphere) is valid only for creeping ow (i.e. very low particle Reynolds number). Modi\"{y}cations to the force balance are tentatively suggested to account for inertial components to the drag force. The predictions of critical velocity are tested against our data for the incipient motion of small hemispheres at pipe walls in hydraulic conveying as well as new and previously published data for both hydraulic and pneumatic conveying. The new method of predicting incipient motion works well for both the pneumatic and hydraulic conveying of hemispheres and sand shaped particles but it overpredicts the critical velocity for more rounded particles. The dependency of critical velocity on particle shape is under-researched.},

Increasing the concentration of the biomass solids during biochemical conversion has a large potential to reduce production costs. These concentrated biomass slurries have highly viscous, non-Newtonian behavior that poses several technical challenges to the conversion process. A collaborative effort to measure the rheology of a biomass slurry at four separate laboratories has been undertaken. A comprehensive set of rheological properties were measured using several different rheometers, flow geometries, and experimental methods. The tendency for settling, water evaporation, and wall slip required special care when performing the experiments. The rheological properties were measured at different concentrations up to 30\% insoluble solids by mass. The slurry was found to be strongly shear-thinning, to be viscoelastic, and to have a significant concentration-dependent yield stress. The elastic modulus was found to be almost an order of magnitude larger than the loss modulus and weakly dependent on frequency. The techniques and results of this work will be useful to characterize other biomass slurries and in the design of biochemical conversion processing steps that operate at high solids concentrations.},

Pore-scale simulation of the flow within the porous bed was achieved through combining the immersed boundary method and the lattice Boltzmann method. Particle transport is computed using an adhesive discrete-element method based on a multi-time-scale soft-sphere model. The fluid flow results are validated by comparison with experimental data for dimensionless permeability of flow in a porous bed of spheres. For computations with non-adhesive particles, the particles are observed to drift to the centre of `channels' in the BCC array, within which most of the fluid flow occurs. The mechanism of this inward drift was found to be related to the phenomenon of oscillatory clustering, which is an inertial drift mechanism observed for particles in a corrugated channel. A measure for particle drift into these channels was developed, and the time rate of change of this measure was found to compare closely with an approximate theoretical prediction based on oscillatory clustering theory. The drift measure was observed to be limited at long time by hold-up of outlier particles caught in long-duration collisions with the fixed bed particles in regions of low fluid velocity magnitude. Simulations with adhesive particles exhibited marked increase in collision duration, as well as inhibition of the tendency to drift toward the flow channels due to adhesive hold-up.},

  abstract      = {In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of thermochemical biomass conversion using the discrete element method (DEM), the need to establish adequate coupling schemes for the fluid-to-particle and particle-to-fluid information exchange arises. Simultaneously, the requirements on the resolution of the fluid fields typically vary throughout the reactor, and the particulate flow regimes can vary from dilute to dense. For such conditions, there is currently a lack of consensus in the literature about the appropriate length scale to establish the aforementioned coupling and on the issue of whether the coupling in the two directions can be chosen independently or not. In the current work, we review the recent literature on coupling in CFD-DEM simulations, with a particular focus on semiresolved approaches. We discuss the different coupling methods available and identify requirements arising from dealing with thermochemical conversion processes. Finally, we establish some general guidelines for the simulation of these processes, while noting that it is impossible to simultaneously enforce symmetric couplings, sampling of the undisturbed fluid state (as sometimes required by correlations), and localized influence of the particle on the fluid fields. It is suggested that future model development shall focus on reintroducing the effects of varying local microstructure of the particulate flow that is filtered out in the particle–fluid coupling whenever excessive coupling lengths are used to stabilize the numerical solution procedure. Data-driven approaches, in combination with nonintrusive experimentation at high spatial and temporal resolution, are identified as a promising route to realize these ambitions.},

Osborne fractionation revealed that the highest amount of protein was extracted with distilled water, namely albumins; followed by glutelin, globulin and prolamin. UAE using distilled water generated the highest protein content in the isolate (\approx{}84\%) compared to HPP (\approx{}63\%). HDC with distilled water, 20 passes and post-extraction by isoelectric precipitation achieved protein contents and recovery rates of approximately 89\% and 72\%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that cavitation technologies were capable of facilitating an efficient separation of starch and protein bodies leading to higher protein extraction compared to the other methods explored.},

The presently proposed model is validated through comparisons with data available for internal flows through channels and for external flows over flat and curved plates with both smooth and rough surfaces. Then, its further validation in separating flows over a sand dune and a sand-roughened ramp is discussed. The validation results suggest that the presently proposed form can be successfully applied to a wide range of attached and separated turbulent flows with heat transfer over smooth and fine-grain rough surfaces.},

  abstract      = {A two-dimensional (2D) lattice Boltzmann-based model is developed to simulate solutal dendritic growth of binary alloys in the presence of forced flow. The model adopts the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) that describes transport phenomena by the evolution of distribution functions of moving pseudoparticles to numerically solve fluid flow and solute transport governed by both convection and diffusion. Based on the LBM-calculated solutal field, the dynamics of dendritic growth is determined according to a previously proposed local solutal equilibrium approach. After detailed model analysis and validation, the model is applied to simulate single and equiaxed multidendritic growth of Al–Cu alloys with forced convection. The results demonstrate the quantitative, numerically stable and computationally efficient capabilities of the proposed model. It is found that the solute distribution and dendritic growth are strongly influenced by convection, producing asymmetrical dendrites that grow faster in the upstream direction, but mostly slower in the downstream direction.},

  abstract      = {LNG vapour dispersion known as dense gas dispersion is one of the main hazards from accidental LNG spill and is of critical importance in risk assessment. Most of the previous studies on this topic were conducted in the singlephase framework which is incapable of considering the effect of fog formation. LNG importing and exporting terminals are typically located at coastal areas where there is a high chance of fog formation. In this study, a multiphase CFD model has been developed to investigate the dynamic mixing of cryogenic LNG vapour cloud and ambient air. The effect of fog formation on LNG vapour dispersion was studied. The model was validated by historical experiments conducted by LLNL, upon which good agreements were achieved. Case studies of different relative humidity were performed in order to investigate the LNG vapour dispersion behaviour affected by different fog concentrations. It was found that the affected area of the vapour dispersion is enlarged if the air relative humidity is increased. The findings in this study could improve the understanding of the mechanism of LNG vapour dispersion in humid environments, and help to provide more reliable risk assessments for LNG plants.},

It is observed from experimental studies that frost formation on a vertical cryogenic surface showed different behaviours compared to refrigeration conditions. Through comparing different empirical correlations of mass transfer, it is found that the Rans–Marshall correlation is suitable to be used to account for frost formation under cryogenic conditions. The simulation results show a good agreement with the experimental study in terms of temperature profile. The mass transfer rate is taken as the parameter to characterise the differences of frost formation under different conditions. Surface temperatures ranging from refrigeration to cryogenic are investigated in order to understand the systematic change of frosting behaviour. Conditions of forced convection at different air velocities are studied to evaluate the mass transfer process. The methodology and results discussed in this study can provide in-depth understandings of mass transfer phenomenon at cryogenic conditions.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling combined with single-phase (dry) and irrigated (multiphase) experiments were carried out to validate the CFD modelling results. Experiments were conducted to measure the dry and wet pressure drop at a range of liquid load (0–38.2 m3/m2\bullet{}h) and F-factor (0–1.2 Pa0.5). Liquid distribution was measured using Wire Mesh Sensor (WMS) for SpiroPak and compared with a commercial and 3D printed replica of Mellpak 250X and Montzpak B1–500. The topology of the packing was analysed to calculate the specific surface area that could be available for mass transfer. It was found that the SpiroPak can have up to 50\textasciitilde 200\% more surface area per unit volume when compared with commercial packing. Experimental and modelling results showed that SpiroPak could reduce the dry pressure drop by approximately 50\%. Parametric study found that reducing corrugation size to increase surface area and increasing the gap size to reduce the pressure drop were key design parameters of SpiroPak. Finally, scale-up and scale-out (tessellation) techniques were compared to determine the optimum element size for the application of SpiroPak on a large scale.},

Before the selective extraction of lithium, the \ensuremath{\beta}-diketones had tautomerism with the product of enol. The enol structure was unsteady in alkaline environment so that Li+ can be selectively extracted by taking the place of hydroxyl hydrogen. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of TOPO intensified the extraction ability by the generation of strong electrostatic. Based on the calculated Gibbs energy changes, the parameters of extraction efficiency and separation factor were analyzed and they had qualitative consistence with the experimental results. Meanwhile, it was determined that the electron-withdrawing effect of the subsistent group in the \ensuremath{\beta}-diketones had a critical influence on the extraction separation performance. Besides, the theoretical model predicted successfully the transition of extraction complex from hydrophilicity to lipophilicity after the combination with synergistic reagent.},

  abstract      = {Alkali leaching is an effective desilication method for improving the alumina-silica mass ratio (A/S) of bauxite. The paper aims to study the kinetics of kaolinite dissolution and hydrosodalite precipitation during alkali leaching of kaolinite-rich diasporic bauxite. Alkali leaching of bauxite in NaOH solutions was studied at Na2O concentrations of 200–260~g/L, temperatures of 90–105~\textdegree{}C, and times of 30–150~min. The leached bauxites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) techniques. The rate equations describing kaolinite dissolution and hydrosodalite precipitation were derived by fitting the Avrami model. The results show that kaolinite with finer particle sizes was preferentially dissolved during alkali leaching, providing a material basis for the precipitation of hydrosodalite. Hydrosodalite was heterogeneously nucleated on the dissolved edges of some kaolinite and grew in both one- and two-dimensions, presenting acicular and lamellar morphology. The dissolution rate of kaolinite and the crystallization mechanism of hydrosodalite were primarily influenced by Na2O concentration and temperature. Both kaolinite dissolution and hydrosodalite precipitation were controlled by chemical reactions with activation energies of 70.152 (\pm{} 1.429) kJ/mol and 289.089 (\pm{} 2.063) kJ/mol, respectively, and the orders of reaction with respect to Na2O of 0.733 (\pm{} 0.070) and 7.165 (\pm{} 0.047), respectively. The kinetic equations describing kaolinite dissolution, hydrosodalite precipitation and even the leaching of SiO2 were eventually modeled with Na2O concentration, temperature and time as variables.},

  abstract      = {In this study, we have derived a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for two-phase flows with thermocapillary effects. This model accommodates variations in physical properties such as density, viscosity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity between the two components. The model equations encompass a Cahn-Hilliard equation with the volume fraction as the phase variable, a Navier-Stokes equation, and a heat equation, and meanwhile maintains mass conservation, energy conservation, and entropy increase simultaneously. Given the highly coupled and nonlinear nature of the model equations, we developed a semi-decoupled, mass-preserving, and entropy-stable time-discrete numerical method. We conducted several numerical tests to validate both our model and numerical method. Additionally, we have investigated the merging process of two bubbles under non-isothermal conditions and compared the results with those under isothermal conditions. Our findings reveal that temperature gradients influence bubble morphology and lead to earlier merging. Moreover, we have observed that the merging of bubbles slows down with increasing heat Peclect number PeT when the initial temperature field increases linearly along the channel, while bubbles merge faster with heat Peclect number PeT when the initial temperature field decreases linearly along the channel.},

  abstract      = {In this report, we have outlined a number of scientific challenges which represent building blocks for the comprehensive understanding of disperse flows encountered in a variety of technologies and in nature. In dilute particle-laden turbulent flows, we see a need for more realistic descriptions of particle–fluid and particle–particle interactions that would ultimately be suitable for incorporation in large eddy simulations. Experiments are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which particles modulate turbulence. Progress in computer simulation methods and kinetic-theory analyses are leading to new opportunities to obtain the equations of motion for more concentrated multiphase flows which are strongly influenced by or dominated by the disperse phase. However, instabilities inherent to the multiphase nature of these flows lead to the very complex behavior of industrial scale multiphase flows. We require a better understanding of these instabilities as well as coarse-grained models for the average multiphase flows at larger scales. A major issue in dense granular flows is to elucidate the manner in which particle–particle frictional interactions can lead either to mixing or segregation of different particle species.},

In this paper, we consider such a scenario by investigating the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics of a novel `slip–stick' spherical particle whose surface is partitioned into slip and no-slip regions. In the limit where the slip length is small compared to the size of the particle, we first compute the translational velocity of such a particle due to the force density on its surface. Subsequently, we compute the rotational velocity and the response to an ambient straining field of a slip–stick particle. These three Fax\'{e}n-type formulae are rich in detail about the dynamics of the particles: chiefly, we find that the translational velocity of a slip–stick sphere is coupled to all of the moments of the force density on its surface; furthermore, such a particle can migrate parallel to the velocity gradient in a shear flow. Perhaps most important is the coupling we predict between torque and translation (and force and rotation), which is uncharacteristic of spherical particles in unbounded Stokes flow and originates purely from the slip–stick asymmetry.},

The reactor design includes Ni - Br in a bubble column acting as a catalyst. Energy and exergy calculations followed by a comprehensive economic analysis were appraised to evaluate the efficiency and performance of the integrated process. The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from the conceptual design ranged from 1.3 to 1.47 U.S.\$/kg, while the proposed design's net present value (NPV) was in the range of 3.76 – 4.35~M.U.S.\$. Factors such as equipment purchase cost (EPC) and feedstock cost significantly influenced the NPV and LCOH. In addition, a positive NPV and lower LCOH outline the proposed design's profitability.

A multifluid Eulerian model incorporating the kinetic theory for solidparticles was appliedin order to simulate the gas–solidflow. Momentum exchange coefficients were calculated using the Syamlal–O'Brien, Gidaspow, and Wen–Yu drag functions. The solid-phase kinetic energy fluctuation was characterized by varying the restitution coefficient values from 0.9 to 0.99. The modeling predictions compared reasonably well with experimental bed expansion ratio measurements andqualitative gas–solidflow patterns. Pressure drops predictedby the simulations were in relatively close agreement with experimental measurements at superficial gas velocities higher than the minimum fluidization velocity, Umf .

  abstract      = {Hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs) are a series of permanent microporous polymer materials initially reported by Davankov, and have received an increasing level of research interest. In recent years, HCPs have experienced rapid growth due to their remarkable advantages such as diverse synthetic methods, easy functionalization, high surface area, low cost reagents and mild operating conditions. Judicious selection of monomers, appropriate length crosslinkers and optimized reaction conditions yielded a well-developed polymer framework with an adjusted porous topology. Post fabrication of the as developed network facilitates the incorporation of various chemical functionalities that may lead to interesting properties and enhance the selection toward a specific application. To date, numerous HCPs have been prepared by post-crosslinking polystyrene-based precursors, one-step self-polycondensation or external crosslinking strategies. The advent of these methodologies has prompted researchers to construct well-defined porous polymer networks with customized micromorphology and functionalities. In this review, we describe not only the basic synthetic principles and strategies of HCPs, but also the advancements in the structural and morphological study as well as the frontiers of potential applications in energy and environmental fields such as gas storage, carbon capture, removal of pollutants, molecular separation, catalysis, drug delivery, sensing etc.},

A general battery model considering both temperature and degradation is often difficult to develop, given the fact that there are many different types of cells with different shapes and/or internal chemical components. In response, a migration-based framework is proposed in this paper for battery modeling, in which the effects of temperature and aging are treated as uncertainties. An accurate model for a fresh cell is established first and then migrated to the degraded batteries through a Bayes Monte Carlo method. Experiments are carried out on both LiFePO4 batteries and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3) O2 batteries under various ambient temperatures and aging levels. The results indicate that the typical voltage prediction error can be limited within \pm{}20 mV, for the cases of temperature change up to 40 \textdegree{}C, and capacity degradation up to 20\%. The proposed method paves ways to an effective battery management and energy control for electric vehicles or micro grid applications.},

In addition, the applicability of rotational periodic boundary conditions in CFD-DEM simulations of cylindrical fluidized beds is still unclear. Therefore, taking cylindrical fluidized bed as the object and studying the performance of different simulation methods can provide guidance for the selection of simulation methods in subsequent related studies. In the present study, TFM and coarse-grained CFD-DEM were used in simulations of the fluidized bed to evaluate the performance of different numerical methods. Furthermore, the applicability of rotating periodic boundary conditions in CFD-DEM simulations was investigated. The results show that TFM and coarse-grained CFD-DEM perform in general agreement in predicting macro variables (e.g., overall pressure drop and bed height). However, radial void fraction distribution and void fraction probability density function (PDF) distribution of CFD-DEM agreed better with the experimental data. CFD-DEM simulations with rotational periodic boundary conditions applied showed lower predicted void fraction PDF peaks at packed bed heights and poorly modelling particle mixing in the central of cylindrical fluidized bed due to changes in the boundary conditions as well as the number of particle parcels. Therefore, both TFM and CFD-DEM can obtain reasonable macro variables, but CFD-DEM predicted more accurate gas–solid two-phase distribution. The CFD-DEM with rotating periodic boundary conditions could not reasonably predict the pressure drop and gas–solid two-phase distribution inside the cylindrical fluidized bed.},

The cavitation phenomenon releases high energy due to the generation and collapse of bubbles, which improves the efficiency of various food processing. This review details the cavitation mechanism of ultrasonic cavitation (UC) and hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), factors affecting cavitation, the application of cavitation technology in food processing, and the application of cavitation technology in the extraction of various natural ingredients. The safety and nutrition of food processed by cavitation technology and future research directions are also discussed. The mechanism of UC refers to longitudinal displacement of the particles of the medium induced by ultrasonic waves causing a series of alternating compression and rarefaction of particles, whereas HC occurs when liquid enters a narrow section and undergoes large pressure differentials, both of which can trigger the generation, growth, and collapse of microbubbles. Cavitation could be applied in microbial inactivation, and drying and freezing processing. In addition, cavitation bubbles can have mechanical and thermal effects on plant cells. In general, cavitation technology is a new sustainable, green, and innovative technology with broad application prospects and capabilities.},

Due to its importance an ability to effectively extract sulforaphane from its source is desirable. This work investigated the feasibility of using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) to extract sulforaphane from cabbages. The effects of various parameters, which are the type of solvent (dichloromethane and water), set microwave power (130, 260 and 390W) and extraction time, on the extraction yield of sulforaphane were investigated. In addition, since it was previously shown that partially dried cabbages contain higher sulforaphane content than fresh cabbages, the effect of partial drying prior to MAE on the extractable amount of sulforaphane was investigated. A comparison between MAE and conventional extraction was also made. The results showed that MAE was more effective than the conventional extraction as the former led to higher yield of sulforaphane in a much shorter extraction time. There were no significant differences in the highest extractable sulforaphane contents from the fresh and semi-dried samples. Use of different solvents also did not lead to any significant effect on the MAE of sulforaphane, either from the fresh or semi-dried sample.},

  abstract      = {Chemical and mechanical engineers are quite familiar with concepts of fluid flow which include mass and momentum balances and constitutive equations which contain such material characteristics as viscosity and density. Combination of the above correlations yields the well-known Navier-Stokes equations which have to be solved to obtain details of the flow field; a large number of analytical solutions of these equations exist. Somewhat similar equations have been develeped for granular materials moving in the rapid granular flow regime, i.e. in the regime in which particle-particle contacts are not very extensive and hence friction is not prevalent. These equations result from a similarity between the movement ot molecules and the flow of small elastic (or elasto-plastie) particles and resemble, for certain limiting eases, the fluid flowequations. Slow, frictional flowsof powders are different in that particles are in contact for extended periods of time and friction is the overwhelming interaction. Flow in this regime is governed by the same mass and momentum balances but the constitutive equations are different. Only very recently have some of these equations been combined to yield a set of differential equations which take the place of the Navier-Stokes equations; only very few solutions of these equations exist. The present paper describes common features and major dissimilarities between different equations of motion for the above systems and some of their solutions and presents examples and comparisons of powder and fluid flows in identical geometries. Furthermore, general equations of motion for compressible powders in slow flow are developed and an example of an analytical s\textasciitilde lution is given.},

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is a unit that converts heavy distillates like gas oil or residues to gasoline and middle distillates using cracking catalyst. About 45\% of worldwide gasoline production comes from FCC processes and its ancillary units. Since a typical FCC unit can process a large amount of the feedstock into more valuable products, the overall economic benefits of a refining could be considerably increased if proper control and optimization strategies are implemented. FCC processes are known to be very difficult to model and control because of the large process scale, complicated hydro-dynamics and complex kinetics of both cracking and coke burning reactions. One of the more heavily investigated terms of nonlinear control, in the field of ``intelligent control'', is that due to fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). FLCs have been successfully applied to a stream of difficult, nonlinear dynamical process such as FCC. Here, with an application to a Turkish refinery FCC unit of FLC fuzzy results obtained using Matlab-Fuzzy Logic Toolbox version 6.5 were found to be acceptable. The paper indicates how fuzzy logic control (FLC), as a promising control technique, would be effectively used for improved process control of FCC in refinery process industry.},

  abstract      = {Slender trickle beds play a crucial role in various industrial processes involving gas-liquid-solid systems. Understanding the wetting characteristics is vital for optimizing their performance and efficiency. In this study, we employ a particle-resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics approach combining the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method for gas-liquid interactions and a second-order implicit Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) for fluid-solid interactions. The particle wettability is modeled by imposing a contact angle boundary condition at the gas-liquid-solid interface. The impact of the liquid flux on the wetting patterns and the rate of liquid penetration depth within the slender trickle bed is studied. The results show two main mechanisms of penetration through the bed: gravitation and inertia driven. The penetration of the liquid in the bed is driven by gravity when the liquid flux is low and the inertia is diminished in the top of the bed. This results in enhanced wetting from the onset of the penetration. If the inertia is high (high liquid flux), the initial liquid penetration is fast and spreading in the bed only occurs after full penetration of the bed.},

  abstract      = {Motivated by the previous literature works of spreadsheet solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a system of ODEs using fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, we have built a spreadsheet calculator for solving ODEs numerically by using the RK4 method and VBA programming. In this spreadsheet calculator, a user interface input form is developed to capture the needed information to solve the ODE via the RK4 method. In the first frame of the user interface input form, users are prompted to enter independent and dependent variables in the ODE. On the other hand, they are needed to input the interval for the independent variables, initial value for the dependent variable, step size h and select the desired accuracy of calculation in the second frame of the user interface input form. Lastly, in the third frame of the user interface input form, users are required to enter the ODE function and exact function of ODE if it exists. Once the Solve button is clicked, the full solution of the ODE will be calculated automatically using the RK4 method. This spreadsheet calculator is user-friendly especially for users who are not familiar with Excel. We hope that this spreadsheet calculator can be used as a marking scheme for educators and students who require the full solutions of the ODEs. Moreover, this spreadsheet calculator reduces calculation time and it is hoped to improve students' learning ability.},

  abstract      = {Purpose of review~         This article recounts the history of the diet-heart hypothesis from the late 1950s up to the current day, with revelations that have never before been published in the scientific literature. These novel insights include the role of authorities in launching the diet-hypothesis, including a potential conflict of interest for the American Heart Association; a number of crucial details regarding studies considered influential to the hypothesis; irregularities in the scientific reviews on saturated fats, for both the 2015 and 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans; and possible conflicts of interest on the relevant subcommittee reviewing saturated fats for the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. Information obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on emails from the 2015 process is published here for the first time. These findings are highly relevant to the 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines process, now underway, which has plans for a new review on saturated fats.         Recent findings~         Recent findings include shortcomings in the scientific review processes on saturated fats, for both the current 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the previous edition (2015–2020). Revelations include the fact that the publication of a book in the lay press triggered a new review of saturated fats for the 2015 Dietary Guidelines and that the Chair of the 2015 Advisory Committee acknowledged, in an e-mail, the lack of scientific justification for any specific numeric cap on these fats. Other, previously unpublished findings include significant potential financial conflicts on the relevant 2020 guidelines subcommittee, including the participation of plant-based advocates, an expert who promotes a plant-based diet for religious reasons, experts who had received extensive funding from industries, such as tree nuts and soy, whose products benefit from continued policy recommendations favoring polyunsaturated fats, and one expert who had spent more than 50 years of her career dedicated to `proving' the diet-heart hypothesis.         Summary~         The idea that saturated fats cause heart disease, called the diet-heart hypothesis, was introduced in the 1950s, based on weak, associational evidence. Subsequent clinical trials attempting to substantiate this hypothesis could never establish a causal link. However, these clinical-trial data were largely ignored for decades, until journalists brought them to light about a decade ago. Subsequent reexaminations of this evidence by nutrition experts have now been published in {$>$}20 review papers, which have largely concluded that saturated fats have no effect on cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality or total mortality. The current challenge is for this new consensus on saturated fats to be recognized by policy makers, who, in the United States, have shown marked resistance to the introduction of the new evidence. In the case of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines, experts have been found even to deny their own evidence. The global re-evaluation of saturated fats that has occurred over the past decade implies that caps on these fats are not warranted and should no longer be part of national dietary guidelines. Conflicts of interest and longstanding biases stand in the way of updating dietary policy to reflect the current evidence.},

  abstract      = {The drag force term appearing in two-fluid models for fluid–particle flows is commonly closed by expressing it as a function of the local quantities, such as the local particle volume fraction, the local slip velocity between the particle and fluid phases, and the local mean-squared fluctuating velocity of the particles. The adequacy of such closures for inhomogeneous suspensions has been debated in the literature and some researchers have suggested the need for additional terms involving spatial gradients in these quantities. To test this proposition, simulations of flow in inhomogeneous steady beds of particles have been performed using the lattice-Boltzmann method. The particle beds consisted of disordered assemblies with a density profile on a scale much larger than the particle radius. Inhomogeneous beds with a controlled density profile were generated in three different ways, (i) by inhomogeneous stretching of the particle bed in one direction, (ii) by applying an inhomogeneous force to the particle phase during random motion of the particles, and (iii) by taking snapshots of a direct simulation of a traveling wave in a fluidization simulation. The global structure of the three beds was comparable, while assessment of the radial distribution functions showed that the three beds exhibited clearly different microscopic structures. The force profiles along the inhomogeneous direction of the particle bed were obtained from the flow simulations. These were analyzed by applying spatial averaging in a manner identical to the averaging procedure that is used to derive the two-fluid model equations. The force profiles were compared to predictions based on flow simulations of homogeneous disordered particle beds over a range of volume fractions. To assess the role of the microstructure of the particle bed also simulations were executed where the homogeneous disordered bed was modified by either applying homogeneous stretching or by applying a lubrication force during generation of the particle bed.},

Formal teaching of chemical engineering at universities only started in the 19th century. Informally, the subject has been in existence at least since Roman times. Highly skilled people have been recognised as a means to ensure prosperity and allow innovation for at least several centuries, as examples like the Bergakademie Freiberg show. It can be shown that skilled people flock to prosperous regions and prosperous regions develop where skilled people aggregate, modern examples include Silicon Valley and Northwestern Europe. The competences needed by a chemical engineer continue to broaden, e.g. sustainability, digitisation force changes in the education of engineers. The sheer volume of material cannot be covered in a tertiary study period and the speed of change makes knowledge obsolete very fast, which puts more focus on new life-long learning requirements.

There is an increasing need for developing new ways of producing emulsions on demand having desired critical quality attributes. Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), which is a process of generation, growth and collapse of vapour cavities leading to intense localised shear and energy dissipation, offers an attractive platform for producing emulsions. In this work, we present experimental and computational results of a breakage of a single oil drop injected in a HC device. A single drop of oil was injected in a continuous stream of demineralised water flowing through a vortex based HC device. Tween 20 surfactant (2\%) was used to prevent coalescence. The droplet size distribution (DSD) at the outlet of HC device was characterised using the imaging method. A detailed 3D computational model was developed to simulate turbulent cavitating flow through the considered HC device and resulting drop breakage and droplet size distribution. The developed model was used to quantitatively relate Sauter mean diameter (d32) and droplet size distribution (DSD) at the outlet with the operating parameters of the HC device. A single-pass through the vortex based HC device was able to bring down droplet size from \sim{}103~\mathrm{\mu}m to \sim{}101~\mathrm{\mu}m. The data and the model discussed in this work will provide a systematic basis for developing models, cavitation devices and operating protocols to produce emulsions with desired DSD.},

  abstract      = {Liquid–liquid emulsions are used in a variety of industry sectors, including personal care, home care, food, and nutrition. The development of compact and modular systems and devices for creating emulsions with desired droplet size distribution (DSD) is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we have shown use of vortex-based cavitation devices for producing emulsions at nominal flow rate of 1 LPM and 20 LPM. We present new experimental results providing quantitative information on influence of multiple passes through the vortex based hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) device, type of oil and device scale on the breakage process and resulting DSDs. Multiple pass experiments were performed for generating oil-in-water emulsions containing 5 and 15\% of oil. Rapeseed oil (RO) and tetrachloroethylene (TCE) were used as oil phases with densities of 915 and 1620 kg/m3, respectively. The effect of pressure drop across the HC device in the range of 50–250 kPa on DSD was examined. The HC device was shown to exhibit significant higher efficiency compared to alternative emulsion making devices (i.e., homogenizers, venturi, and orifice-based HC devices), and the Sauter mean drop size was found to reduce from 66 \ensuremath{\mu}m to less than 2 \ensuremath{\mu}m after about 50 passes in all the device scales. The DSD of the RO–water system showed a bimodal nature, whereas monomodal DSD was found for TCE–water system. Preliminary simulations using the computational fluid dynamics–population balance model (CFD-PBM) models developed in the previous work indicated the inadequacy of developed models to capture the influence of cavitation on DSDs. By carrying out Hinze scale analysis of bimodal DSD, we for the first time showed the existence of two different mechanisms (one based on conventional turbulent shear and the other based on collapsing cavities) of droplet breakage in HC devices. The order of magnitude of turbulence energy dissipation rates generated due to collapsing cavity estimated using Hinze scale analysis showed good agreement with the values reported from cavity dynamics models. The presented experimental results and analysis will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in developing computational models and compact devices for producing emulsions of the desired DSD.},

The effect of pressure drop across the HC device in the range of 50–250 kPa on drop breakage was examined. DSD of emulsions produced through a single pass was measured using the focussed beam reflectance measurements. Comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the Eulerian approach was developed to simulate multiphase cavitating flow. Using the simulated flow, population balance model (PBM) with appropriate breakage kernels was solved to simulate droplet breakage in a vortex-based HC device. The device showed an excellent drop breakage efficiency (nearly 1\% which is much higher than other commercial devices such as rotor–stators or sonolators) and was able to reduce mean drop size from 66 to 15 \ensuremath{\mu}m in a single pass. The CFD and PBM models were able to simulate DSD.

We have experimentally and computationally investigated key flow characteristics of vortex based cavitation devices. The cavitating flow in such devices was simulated over a wide range of viscosities and over a range of device scales. Experiments were carried out using aqueous solutions of glycerol up to a viscosity of 800 cP. Cavitation inception was identified using acoustic signals. The simulated values of pressure drop and cavitation inception were compared with the experimental data. New correlations for estimating pressure drop (Euler number) and cavitation inception were developed. The correlations were able to describe three distinct regimes observed in the experimental data of pressure drop. The pressure drop and throat velocity required for the inception of cavitation were found to increase with an increase in viscosity. The presented results and developed correlations will be very useful for designing vortex based cavitation devices for a variety of applications.},

In this work, the performance of machined and 3D-printed vortex-based HC devices for producing liquid-liquid emulsions was compared in terms of droplet breakage efficiency and energy consumption per kilogram of emulsion. The Euler numbers of 3D-printed and VMC-machined HC devices were 42 and 48, respectively. The differences in droplet size distribution and other characteristic diameters were insignificant after 50 passes. The present work confirms the potential of harnessing 3D printing technology for fabricating HC devices and can facilitate development of new device designs to improve overall emulsification performance.},

The numerical simulation revealed that wall roughness significantly reduced the `particle free zone' and smoothed the particle number density profiles by altering the particle rebounding behaviours. It was also found that wall roughness reduced the particle mean velocities and also increased the particle fluctuating velocities in both streamwise and transverse directions.},

The work presented in this paper includes both theoretical calculations and experimental work on three-phase flow using multibeam gamma-ray densitometry. It is demonstrated that a fan beam geometry with one radiation source and several collimated detectors is sufficient to provide information on the liquid–gas distribution of the pipe flow. In order to perform testing on deviated multiphase oil, water and gas flows, a special tilt section was designed and built. Several different flow regimes were successfully identified from the acquired experimental measurement data.

  abstract      = {The implementation of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technology for efficient energy storage requires the development of a reliable kinetic model for both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. In this research study, the catalytic hydrocarbon saturation for a dibenzyltoluene (DBT) mixture solution, containing dibenzylbenzene (DBB), dibenzylethylbenzene (DBEB) and impurities has been performed in the presence of Ru/Al2O3 particles. The influence of different reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, initial reactant concentration, catalyst amount and stirring speed has been examined. A measurement-based system micro-kinetics, based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism with dissociative H2 surface adsorption, has been derived. H2 thermodynamic solubility equilibrium was defined through Henry's law. The adsorbing, desorption and reactivity of inert solvent molecules was not considered to be relevant. The mass transfer resistance over 1000~rpm stirring speed was negligible. Relative- and mean squared error of representation were 40.9\% and 1.00\texttimes{}10-4, respectively. Expressions gave an excellent data prediction for the profile period trends with a relatively accurate estimation of H2 intermediates' rate selectivity, H2-covered area approximation and pathway rate-determining steps. Due to the lack of commercially available standard chemical compounds for quantitative analysis techniques, a novel experiment-based numerical calibration method was developed. Mean field (micro)kinetics represent an advancement in the mesoscale mechanistic understanding of physical interface phenomena. This also enables catalysis structure–activity relationships, unlocking the methodology for new LOHC reaching beyond traditional, such as ammonia, methanol and formate, which do not release H2 alone. Integrated multiscale simulations could include fluidics later on.},

Although EIT systems have often been applied to yield qualitative information about gas–solid flows, the present EIT system yields quantitative information that is validated by comparison to a gamma densitometry tomography (GDT) system. EIT and GDT were applied to the CFB riser (14-cm inner diameter, 5.77-m height) containing fluid catalytic cracking particles in air.

For all cases, the average and near-wall solids volume fractions from EIT and GDT agreed to within 0.03 and 0.07, respectively. This good agreement suggests that, where feasible, EIT can be used in place of GDT, which is advantageous since EIT systems are often safer, less expensive, and faster than GDT systems.},

It has become increasingly more important to develop good, and theoretically sound models for scaling up and design of the reactors. The most common models used today rely heavily upon empirical information obtainable only from pilot size experiments and this makes ``a priori'' design from small scale data difficult. The model presented is based on a ``first principles'' approach where the parameters are fundamental in nature and as far as possible, obtainable from general fluid dynamics literature. It is a dynamic two phase model incorporating a k-\ensuremath{\epsilon} turbulence model, compressible gas phase and axisymmetry. The equations are discretisized using a finite volume technique with an upwind or hybrid differencing scheme and solved using a variation of the SIMPLE (Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) method. The results from simulations of a two-phase bubble column are compared with measured radial distributions of gas hold-up, liquid velocity and turbulent kinetic energy using air and desalinated water as media. As chemical reaction, the production of methanol from synthesis gas is implemented. Simulation results using a pseudohomogenous 3-phase slurry model are compared with data from literature.},

From these measurements, a new and accurate empirical correlation for the drag coefficient, CD, of variously shaped particles has been developed. This correlation has been formulated in terms of the Reynolds number based on the particle nominal diameter, Re, the ratio of the surface-equivalent-sphere to the nominal diameters, dA/dn, and the particle circularity, c. The predictions have been tested against both the experimental data for CD collected in this study and the ones reported in previous works for cubes, rectangular parallelepipeds, tetrahedrons, cylinders and other shapes.

We solve the two-dimensional stationary Navier-Stokes equations within a geometrically intricate domain and explore methodologies that allow us to integrate additional physical insights into the model. These approaches include imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) strongly and employing domain decomposition (DD), with both overlapping and non-overlapping subdomains. We adapt the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) approach to solve different sets of equations in distinct subdomains based on the diverse flow characteristics present in each region. Our exploration results in a hierarchy of models spanning various levels of complexity, where the best models exhibit \$ \textbackslash ell\_1 \$ prediction errors of less than 1\% for both pressure and velocity. To illustrate the reproducibility of our approach, we track the errors over repeated independent training runs of the best identified model and show its reliability. Subsequently, by incorporating the stirring rate as a parametric input, we develop a fast-to-evaluate model of the flow capable of interpolating across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Although we exclusively restrict ourselves to STRs in this work, we conclude that the steps taken to obtain the presented model hierarchy can be transferred to other applications.},

The methodology is investigated using the example of the control of dispersity and molecular weight distribution in a batch reactor for emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate. An artifical neural network (ANN) is used as a model to predict the quality as a function of the manipulated variables and on-line measurements. This model is constructed using an augmented dataset that integrates experimental information and knowledge from a mathematical model. The proposed model is compared with other types such as a theoretical model whose key parameters are fitted to experimental data. The hybrid ANN is superior to the parameter-fitting approach for this case. Experimental and simulation studies confirm the advantage of using the proposed model and the predictive control algorithm.},

In this work, we close this performance gap by introducing a neural nano-optics imager. We devise a fully differentiable learning framework that learns a metasurface physical structure in conjunction with a neural feature-based image reconstruction algorithm. Experimentally validating the proposed method, we achieve an order of magnitude lower reconstruction error than existing approaches. As such, we present a high-quality, nano-optic imager that combines the widest field-of-view for full-color metasurface operation while simultaneously achieving the largest demonstrated aperture of 0.5 mm at an f-number of 2.},

  abstract      = {Despite its potential as an environmentally clean fuel and energy source, hydrogen storage and utilization has been significantly hampered by its extremely low volumetric density (0.08988~g/L at 1~atm), making it inefficient to store and transport. Therefore, liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) systems are being recently investigated as potential alternatives for hydrogen storage and transport. However, as a budding research area, the selection of a suitable LOHC, its deployment in hydrogen fuel stations, and its economic viability are not well established. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive investigation of four different LOHCs [Methylcyclohexane (MCH), Dibenzyltoluene (DBT), N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) and Naphthalene (NAP)] via Aspen HYSYS simulations. The LOHCs were compared and contrasted using their physiochemical properties, techno-economic analysis and heat network integration. The techno-economic analysis revealed that NAP-based hydrogen storage has the lowest cost among the LOHC options, while NEC shows the highest cost. However, when considering the breakeven point, the order changes to DBT, MCH, NAP, and NEC with 3, 3.8, 5.1 and 5.9, respectively. This result is attributed to the different hydrogen uptakes of the LOHCs, resulting in a longer breakeven period for NEC. Internal rate of return and net present value analysis also demonstrated the superior economic feasibility of the proposed systems. In terms of heat integration, the DBT process outperformed the other LOHCs as the most heat-efficient process with 80~\% utility reduction, while the NEC process exhibited the lowest heat integration potential of 66.7~\% utility reduction. Combining these findings with the physiochemical properties of the LOHCs, DBT emerges as the most attractive due to its favorable performance across multiple categories, such as toxicities, prices, energy consumptions, and material handling, using a spiderweb diagram.},

Recently, a highly active catalyst made of Ni/ZrO2 for methanation has been developed, and is currently investigated as a potential use in a high-performance reactor. However, design of reactor must be carried out carefully, since this reaction is highly exothermic, which may cause reactor runaway and deterioration of catalysts. For this problem, a mathematical model that can predict the behavior inside the reactor is necessary. In this work, we consider the methanation reaction of CO2 in a reactor model and estimate the kinetic parameters in the reaction rate model from experimental data. In the parameter estimation using literature values and Tikhonov regularization, eight kinetic parameters in the rate equations were identified from 64 data points with a wide range of conditions. We confirm that molar fractions at the reactor exit predicted by this reactor model are in good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the developed model was validated to predict the compositions and temperature that were not used in the estimation. We expect the developed model will be a powerful tool for the reactor design.},

Second, calculated results based on the discrete particle model are compared with the results of Tsuo and Gidaspow (AIChE J., 36 (6) (1990) 885) who used the two-fluid model to predict cluster patterns in the riser of a circulating fluidized bed. Following Tsuo and Gidaspow, parametric studies were conducted, that is, the effects of gas velocity, solids mass flux, particle size and duct size on flow patterns were studied. Quantitatively, a large difference is observed between the results of both models. For instance, the cluster population is much larger in the discrete particle model than in the twofluid model. Qualitatively, both results exhibit the same tendencies in most cases. However, concerning the effect of duct size, even the qualitative results are different: the discrete particle model shows that as the duct size increases, clusters are formed not only near the wall but also in the central part of the duct, while the two-fluid model gives the result that clusters disappear in a wide duct as the duct size increases. The present authors neglect fluid viscosity and thus the results are not satisfactory near the wall. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

Next, methods of numerical analysis of gas–particle flows are classified based on the concept of length scale. That is, the methods are classified into micro-, meso- and macro-scale approaches. The scalebased classification is applied to gas-phase and particulate phase, respectively. Most of existing models of multiphase flows are categorized into one of the combination of scale-based models for gas and particles. After the classification, description focuses on the discrete particle simulation which belongs to the micro-scale approach for the particle phase. The advantage of the particle–micro approach is to deal with particle–particle interaction in the rational way. To treat the particle-to-particle interaction mathematically, techniques named DEM (Distinct Element Method) and DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) have been developed. DEM is a powerful means for the contact-dominated flows and DSMC method for the collision-dominated flows. Combining DEM or DSMC with CFD (computer fluid dynamics), applications of the discrete particle simulation have drastically expanded into many industrial flows because both particle-to-particle and particle-to-fluid interactions have significant effects on most industrial flows. Various examples of simulations are shown; such as dense phase pneumatic conveying, spouted bed, fast circulating fluidized bed and so on.},

  abstract      = {Hypercrosslinked polystyrene networks have been recognised since the 1970s. They were prepared by extensive crosslinking of linear polystyrene chains in a strongly solvating media. Generally, the basic principle of obtaining hypercrosslinked polymers consists in the formation of a rigid highly solvated three-dimensional network. Owing to the high rigidity and reduced degree of chain entanglement, such ``expanded'' networks are characterized by loose chain packing, i.e., high free volume, and the unique ability to swell in both good solvents and non-solvents. In addition to the above polymer-analogues transformation of polystyrene, the article expands the synthesis techniques to polymerization and polycondensation procedures and also involves other types of polymers and monomers. Typical examples of preparing hypercrosslinked networks include the crosslinking of linear chains of polysulfone and polyarylates, copolymerization of styrene with a large amount of divinylbenzene, self-condensation of p-xylylene dichloride. All resulting materials differ substantially from classical polymers of the same chemical nature and comprise a new class of hypercrosslinked polymeric materials. Some polymers described in the literature were shown to also belong to the hypercrosslinked family.},

Dietary fibre concentrates (DFC) that are low in sugar and neutral in taste are sought by the food industry to increase DF content and improve texture in food products. The aim was to set up a biorefinery process to produce DFC from forced roots of Belgian endive (DFC-BE) and characterise the resulting product. As a control, non-treated forced roots powder (FRP-BE) was tested. Water extraction significantly (p~{$<~$}0.05) decreased the content of sugars, phenolic acids (PA) and sesquiterpene lactones (SL) in DFC-BE. In contrast, total dietary fibre concentration (TDF) was higher in DFC-BE (81.82~g/100~g DW) in comparison to FRP-BE (49.04~g/100~g DW). DFC-BE offers an excellent water holding capacity (WHC) of 14.71~g water/g DW and a swelling capacity (SWC) of 23.46~mL water/g DW, suggesting possible use as a functional food ingredient.},

Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) provide flexibility in use as they are available in the form of powder, granule, and fiber. Superabsorbent fiber is mainly produced by two different ways, i.e. mixing the superabsorbent material with hydrophobic/hydrophilic material or directly using a SAP in fiber spinning with dry or wet spinning technology. Superabsorbent fibers are superior to conventional wood pulp and cotton linter that are superabsorbent by nature and can be blended with natural and synthetic fibers and converted into a wide range of yarn and fabric structures. The global demand for absorbent products continues to increase with the growth of population. This chapter focuses on superabsorbent fibers, their production, test methods, and finally applications together with brief explanation of main principle of superabsorbency and polymer materials.},

This technique has been applied to a variety of multiphase flow reactors largely based on the theoretical framework for optimal design and performance parameters. No systematic evaluation and validation of the design and performance parameters of the RPT technique has been reported in the literature thus far. Consequently, the theoretical framework for the design of RPT experiments has had limited scalability and application to a wide variety of flow systems. Thus far, design of a ``good'' RPT experiment continues to be an art, no matter how much the richness of flow of information that the experimental method brings. The present work reports systematic experimental evaluation of design parameters for an optimal RPT experiment and validation of the theoretical results reported in literature. The experiments were performed in a carefully designed setup in which precise positioning of the tracer particle was made possible. The experiments assess the effect of various parameters on the performance of the RPT experiment, such as the choice of radioactive isotope, activity, gamma-ray energy, size of the detector, and relative positioning of detectors. Finally, a set of recommendations based on experimental work are provided to ``optimally'' perform the RPT experiment in any single or multiphase reactor.},

  abstract      = {In this project, the selective oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride (MAN) was studied. Gas phase catalytic oxidation of benzene was carried out in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor on six different types of catalysts, which have different compositions. Effects of temperature, flow rates of benzene and air and catalyst type on the reaction selectivity were investigated at atmospheric pressure. The experiments were performed over a temperature range of 325 to 400 \textdegree{}C, a space-time (W/FA0) range from 11.28 \texttimes{} 105 to 31.9 \texttimes{} 105 g s mol–1, and benzene/ air mole ratio changes between 0.0109 and 0.0477. It was seen that conversion of benzene to MAN increased with increasing temperature for the catalysts supported by silica gel, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. From the results it was found that conversion increased with increasing flow rate of air. When the comparison of the catalysts were made, it could be said that catalysts supported by silica gel showed higher MAN conversions. So it can be concluded that catalysts supported by silica gel were more suitable catalysts for benzene oxidation to MAN in a fluidized bed reactor.},

Typically, spectral features of the cavitation noise signals obtained through Fourier analysis are specific to the experimental set-up and are analyzed to classify the signals in terms of presumed domains of bubble behaviors. The objective of this research was to develop the experimental capabilities and algorithm to monitor and classify cavitation a priori using machine learning (ML) in a precise, repeatable, and translatable fashion among various setups and applications. Initially, simultaneous high-speed videos and passive acoustics maps were acquired for a single oscillating bubble in a simple setup. Machine learning methods such as support vector machine and convolutional neural networks were used to classify the acoustic data and train a classification algorithm. The algorithm was then adapted for a novel sonochemical reactor that induces spontaneous cavitation nucleation and utilizes a passive cavitation detector to monitor cavitation noise. Further research will be done in correlating potassium iodide (KI) degradation with frequency spectra using ML classification in order to optimize the sonochemical efficiency.},

  abstract      = {In fluidised bed olefin polymerisation reactors, a liquid monomer is added for enhancing heat removal (super-condensed mode). This broadens the operating window and can substantially increase the capacity of a given reactor hardware. Design and location of liquid injection nozzles play a key role in dictating the performance of condensed mode operations. An understanding of the fundamental characteristics of droplet impingement onto solid particles is critical for proper design. In this paper, we study the interactions between liquid droplets and hot solid surfaces across various boiling regimes. High-speed digital imaging is used to capture the droplet vaporisation process. Water droplets impacting on a solid wall with different Weber numbers are investigated. The effect of various parameters such as surface and initial droplet diameter, liquid velocity and surface tension is studied. Experimental data of dynamic drop impact on a flat hot surface are reported. A phenomenological model is developed to describe the droplet vaporisation phenomena in single phase and nucleate boiling regimes. The results from the phenomenological model are compared with the experimental data presented here and the experimental results reported in the literature. The study provides useful clues for understanding the real case when solid particles are much larger than the injected liquid droplets.},

  abstract      = {Intensification is intrinsic to better chemical and process engineering and has always been used in practice. Multiphase reactions and reactors are ubiquitous in chemical and allied industries and are of great economic and ecological importance. There is a great scope for intensifying multiphase reactions and reactors for realizing productivity enhancements, which are crucial for sustainable manufacturing. These enhancements can be in terms of increased throughput; better yield, conversion, and selectivity; smaller environmental footprint; and intrinsically safer operations. The advances in intensified reactors, especially microreactors and microfluidic devices, have created significant awareness about intensification in recent decades. In this article, we discuss different strategies for intensifying multiphase reactions and reactors based on the published information. A variety of tools and examples are presented to showcase the potential of intensification. We have found the efforts toward intensification of multiphase reactions and reactors very rewarding academically as well as professionally. We hope that this article will further stimulate interest in this area and pave the way toward realizing next generation productivity for chemical and allied industries.},

  abstract      = {Liquid-fluidized beds of noncohesive beads, gas-fluidized beds of noncohesive light beads, and gas-fluidized beds of fine particles are examples of systems exhibiting nonbubbling fluid-like fluidization. In contrast, stable fluid bubbles have been seen to develop continuously in liquid-fluidized beds of high-density beads, gas-fluidized beds of noncohesive beads, and gas-fluidized beds of fine particles at high gas velocities. On the other hand, for slightly cohesive particles bubbling is just restrained by permanent interparticle contacts in a solid-like fluidized bed. The disparity of behavior between these apparently disconnected systems has contributed to feed a longstanding controversy on the mechanism of bubbling suppression in fluidized beds that still persists. In this article, a description of fluidized beds of cohesive powders based on particle agglomeration due to attractive forces is demonstrated. The effects of fluid viscosity and particle size and density on the type of fluidization behavior are investigated. A main finding is that for fluidization of sufficiently fine particles and=or with high-viscosity gas the fluidized bed transits directly from a nonbubbling fluid-like state to elutriation. A review of empirical observations reported in the literature illustrates a Geldart's diagram modified to consider multistage agglomeration of nanoparticles. The proposed diagram serves to discriminate between the so-called agglomerate particulate fluidization (APF) behavior and agglomerate bubbling fluidization (ABF) behavior on the basis of primary particle size and density.},

  abstract      = {Results are presented of an experimental investigation on how bed inclination affects the fluidization and sedimentation behavior of fine cohesive particles. In contrast with the expected Geldart C behavior, and due to self-agglomeration, these fine particles are uniformly fluidized by gas in a vertically oriented bed, displaying a fluid-like regime and expanding smoothly as the gas velocity is increased. When the gas flow supply to the bed is suddenly stopped, the initial sedimentation velocity of the vertically oriented bed is similar to the fluidizing gas velocity as corresponds to uniform fluidization. The main effect of inclination is to induce fluidization heterogeneity. The local gas velocity increases in the adjacent region to the upper wall at the expense of the region adjacent to the lower wall. This situation anticipates the onset of local bubbling in the region adjacent to the upper wall. Meanwhile the region adjacent to the lower wall remains in a solid-like state and does not reach the fluid-like state until values of the gas flow are applied much higher than those needed in a vertical fluidized bed. As a consequence, the expansion and fluidization uniformity of the tilted bed are hindered. If the gas supply to the inclined bed is suddenly stopped, and because of induced heterogeneity, sedimentation takes place at a decreased rate as compared with sedimentation velocity in the uniformly fluidized vertical bed.},

Expansion of the non-bubbling bed depends on the orientation of the applied field with respect to gas flow. Hindered bed expansion is reported for axial fields, whereas enhanced expansion is observed for transversal fields. In the present paper we propose a modified Richardson–Zaki equation that takes into account aggregation and chain orientation to describe bed expansion as the gas flow is increased. The only free parameter in this equation is the chain length, that is directly related to the field intensity through a magnetic granular Bond number, defined as the ratio of magnetic to gravitational energy per unit volume. Results from the proposed model are successfully compared with published data in the literature.},

  abstract      = {Spout fluidized beds find widespread application in the process industry in granulation processes, in which efficient contacting between large particles, droplets and gas is of paramount importance. However, detailed understanding of the complex behavior of these systems is lacking. In this paper, we study the effect of the inter-particle interaction on the bed dynamics, by investigating the bed dynamics as a function of the restitution coefficient. This is done computationally, with the use of an extended discrete particle model. The examined flow regimes comprise the intermediate/spout-fluidization regime (B1), the spouting-withaeration regime (B2) and the jet-in-fluidized-bed regime (B3). The pressure drop and the vertical particle velocity are compared to experimental data obtained by Link (Chem. Eng. Sci. 2007, 62, 195). The computed results with en = 0.97 show the same resemblance with the experiments. It is shown that, if the restitution coefficient decreases, more bubbles are present causing more pronounced heterogeneity (instability) in the overall flow structure of the bed, to more or less extent dependent on the flow regime. The particle velocity and root mean square profiles confirm the effect on the stability of the bed and show that the spout channel for cases B1 and B3 becomes unstable when the restitution coefficient decreases. For case B2, a transition occurs from the spouting-with-aeration to the intermediate/spout-fluidization regime at low restitution coefficient. These findings show the great importance of the influence of the restitution coefficient on the dynamics of the bed. During the granulation process, when the particles contain different moisture contents, regions in the bed exist that contain particles with different restitution coefficients. These regions thus experience different dynamics, resulting in varying performance.},

  abstract      = {Dense gas-particle flows are encountered in a variety of industrially important processes for large scale production of fuels, fertilizers and base chemicals. The scale-up of these processes is often problematic and is related to the intrinsic complexities of these flows which are unfortunately not yet fully understood despite significant efforts made in both academic and industrial research laboratories. In dense gas-particle flows both (effective) fluid-particle and (dissipative) particle-particle interactions need to be accounted for because these phenomena to a large extent govern the prevailing flow phenomena, i.e. the formation and evolution of heterogeneous structures. These structures have significant impact on the quality of the gas-solid contact and as a direct consequence thereof strongly affect the performance of the process. Due to the inherent complexity of dense gas-particles flows, we have adopted a multi-scale modeling approach in which both fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions can be properly accounted for. The idea is essentially that fundamental models, taking into account the relevant details of fluid-particle (lattice Boltzmann model) and particle-particle (discrete particle model) interactions, are used to develop closure laws to feed continuum models which can be used to compute the flow structures on a much larger (industrial) scale. Our multi-scale approach (see Fig.1) involves the lattice Boltzmann model, the discrete particle model, the continuum model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow, and the discrete bubble model. In this paper we give an overview of the multi-scale modeling strategy, accompanied by illustrative computational results for bubble formation. In addition, areas which need substantial further attention will be highlighted.},

Over the years, researchers have developed a large number of numerical models of gas-fluidized beds that describe gassolid flow at different levels of detail. In this review, we discriminate these models on the basis of whether a Lagrangian or a Eulerian approach is used for the gas and/or particulate flow and subsequently classify them into five main categories, three of which we discuss in more detail. Specifically, these are resolved discrete particle models (also called direct numerical simulations), unresolved discrete particle models (also called discrete element models), and two-fluid models. For each of the levels of description, we give the general equations of motion and indicate how they can be solved numerically by finite-difference techniques, followed by some illustrative examples of a fluidized bed simulation. Finally, we address some of the challenges ahead in the multiscale modeling of gas-fluidized beds.},

  abstract      = {Recently reported results on the origin, propagation and attenuation of pressure waves in bubbling gas-solid fluidized beds are re-evaluated and the results are compared with additional experiments reported here. It is found that the measured pressure fluctuations are a result of slow and fast propagating pressure waves. Pressure waves with high propagation velocities ( {$>$} 10 m / s) are unambiguously identified as compression waves, which move upwards and downwards. Upward moving compression waves originate from gas bubble formation and gas bubble coalescence. The amplitude of upward moving pressure waves is linearly dependent on the distance to the bed surface. Downward moving compression waves are caused by gas bubble eruptions at the fluidized bed surface, bubble coalescence and by changes in bed voidage. In this case the pressure wave amplitude is independent of the distance to the bed surface. Pressure waves with propagation velocities of less than 2 m/s are caused by rising gas bubbles. These pressure waves move upwards only, with an amplitude proportional to the bubble size. The average wave propagation velocity measured in a freely bubbling bed is lower than that predicted from the pseudo-homogeneous compressible wave theory owing to the presence of slowly rising gas bubbles. The average propagation velocity of pressure waves in a gassolid circulating fluidized bed is adequately described as a function of local voidage by pseudo-homogeneous compressible wave theory. At low voidages in the bottom of the riser, the propagation velocity is lowered by the presence of gas bubbles or large gas voids. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

  abstract      = {The dynamic behaviour of gas–solids flow in a CFB riser is characterized by Fourier spectral analysis of pressure fluctuations. Time series of pressure fluctuations were recorded at different measurement positions in a lab-scale riser at gas velocities of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0m/s under dilute and dense flow conditions, with solids mass fluxes ranging from 0 to 232kg/m2s. When dense flow conditions are met at the measurement position, two regions with different power-law fall-off are observed in the power spectral density. At dilute flow conditions, no clear regions with a power-law fall-off are observed. The power in region I shows a sharp decrease from a value of \approx{}2–\approx{}0.5 at the transition from dilute to dense flow at the measurement position. With increasing mass flux, the power increases to a value of approximately 2 again. The power in region II increases from a value of \approx{}3.5–\approx{}5 for all measurement positions when a dense bed is formed in the bottom section of the riser. With the coherence between measurement positions, it is demonstrated that gas/particle turbulence is a negligible source for pressure fluctuations. Gas velocity fluctuations and solids clusters are the predominant sources for these fluctuations. The power-law fall-off regions are attributed to solids clusters, and explained by the typical triangular or saw-tooth shape of the pressure fluctuations.},

The optimization considered three objectives: the maximization of the ethylene oxide production and selectivity, and the maximization of a safety factor related to the presence of oxygen in the reactor. The Pareto domain for this optimization problem was first approximated using the Objective-Based Gradient Algorithm, and the Pareto-optimal solutions were ranked using the Net-Flow procedure to determine the best operating conditions. From the optimization results, it is recommended that the ethylene oxide reactor be operated at high inlet pressure and gas temperature, and low inlet volumetric gas flowrate and chemical reaction moderator concentration. These operating conditions led to the highest ranked compromise solution, balancing the trade-off between each of the three objectives. Finally, it was found that a decrease in the inlet pressure or variation in the volumetric gas flowrate could readily lead to operating conditions outside of the Pareto domain, and these input variables should therefore be carefully controlled throughout operation of the reactor.},

This reactor was designed to allow for a swirling motion of the liquid carrier material, favouring the removal of H2 gas from the flow and forcing the equilibrium of the reaction towards dehydrogenation, as well as to keep the catalyst particles in motion. The CFD simulations were validated qualitatively with experimental operation of the reactor, in a system with identical dimensionless numbers (Reynolds and Stokes), in order to use less costly products during the prototyping phase.},

  abstract      = {The hydrodynamics of a compact dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasifier, consisting of a short riser and a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB), designed for high-ash coal, has been investigated. The effects of fluidization numbers from various aeration ports, and secondary aeration (SA) in the riser have been examined on solids circulation rate and solids holdup in the DFB. The performance of solids recycle systems has been investigated for on-bed and in-bed solids discharge from the BFB to the riser resulting in a low- and high- bed density operation in the riser. For high superficial gas velocity and high-density operation of the riser, an intense solids backmixing is noticed near the riser-exit, which decreases when SA is used. SA is found to be more effective in maintaining a proper balance between solids holdup and solids circulation rate when the bottom riser bed is operated in the fast fluidized bed regime for in-bed solids discharge. Acoustic and electrostatic signals were used to detect and analyze the flow regimes transition in vertical pneumatic conveying from the scope of particle motion. It was found that the minimum acoustic energy and electrostatic accumulation appeared close to the minimum transport velocity. Furthermore, analysis of particle velocity based on electrostatic signals demonstrated that negative particle velocities appeared in plug flow since particles fell down between plugs, thus collision between falling particles and plug dominated and the energy fraction of collision increased with the decreasing gas velocity in plug flow. Finally, based on combination of different detection methods, two new flow regimes transition diagrams were developed. The one based on AE energy and pressure drop indicated different relationships between particle-wall interaction and energy loss in different flow regimes, while another one based on the electrostatic accumulation demonstrated the transition zone between the minimum transport velocity and flow regime transition velocity. Dynamic modeling is required to understand hydrodynamics of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser as a function of time. The paper develops a dynamic model of the riser from the conservation of solid mass. Solid mass that flows out of the riser requires particle residence time to close the mass balance equation. The mean residence time of solids was derived as the riser length divided by the superficial riser gas velocity normalized by a ratio of solid concentration in the riser outlet to that in the riser itself. For bed materials including high-density polyethylene beads, glass beads, and cork, the percentage of solid concentration in the horizontal crossover pipe connecting the riser exit and the cyclone inlet was found to be 22\% of the average concentration of solids in the riser. Upon finding the particle residence time, we calculated the solid flow rate out of the riser and along with the knowledge of solids flowing into the riser column we determined the riser inventory as a function of time. We used the estimated solid inventory to model overall pressure drop across the riser from the conservation of momentum. The momentum equation included the balance of pressure force by the hydrostatic head of solids, and the wall frictions due to gas and solids in a fully developed zone. The prediction of overall riser pressure drop compared well with its measured values at many dynamic conditions. Therefore, our dynamic model is useful for developing advanced control strategy or for improving existing control systems of the CFB plant. The residence time approach is also useful for the design of a transport reactor. The technique also comes handy when setting up the boundary condition for the overall pressure drop in the CFD modeling that can simulate incremental pressures along the riser height. Accurate information concerning riser inventory in a fluidized bed is required in some applications such as the calcium looping process, because it is related to the CO2 capture efficiency of the system. In a circulating fluidized bed (CFB), the riser inventory is normally calculated from the riser pressure drop; however, the friction and the acceleration phenomena may have a significant influence on the total riser pressure drop. Therefore, deviation may occur in the calculation from the actual mass. For this reason the magnitude of the friction and the acceleration pressure drop in the entire riser is studied in small-scale risers. Two series of studies were performed: the first one in a scaled cold model riser of the 10 kWth facility, and the second one in the 10 kWth fluidized bed riser under process conditions. The velocities were chosen to comply with the fluidization regimes suitable for the calcium looping process, namely, the turbulent and the fast. In cold-model experiments in a low-velocity turbulent fluidization regime, the actual weight (static pressure drop) of the particles is observed more than the weight calculated from a recorded pressure drop. This phenomenon is also repeated in pilot plant conditions. In the cold-model setup, the friction and acceleration pressure drop became apparent in the fast fluidization regime, and increased as the gas velocity rose. Within calcium looping conditions in the pilot plant operation, the static pressure drop was observed more than the recorded pressure drop. Therefore, as a conservative approach, the influence of friction pressure drop may be neglected while calculating the solid inventory of the riser. The concept of transit inventory is introduced as a fraction of total inventory, which lies in freefall zones of the CFB system. This fraction increases as gas velocity rises. Cluster structures affect macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior in gas–solid risers. The moment and energy balances for the dense phase and dilute phase are presented by the multi-scale resolution approach to investigate the dependence of drag coefficient on structure parameters. The modified model of cluster structure-dependent (CSD) drag coefficient is proposed on the basis of the minimization of energy dissipation by heterogeneous drag (MEDHD). Unlike previous works on CSD drag coefficient model, the modified CSD drag model takes wall friction into account. The closure for the drag coefficient depends not only on flow behavior of gas and particles but also on the wall friction. The structure-dependent drag coefficients calculated from the approach of the minimization of energy dissipation by drag force are then incorporated into the two-fluid model to simulate the behavior of gas–solid flow in a riser. The distributions of concentration and velocity of particles are predicted. Simulated results are in agreement with experimental data published in the literature. The effect of the wall friction on flow behavior of particles is analyzed. Friction between co-current downflow gas–solid flow and column wall was investigated by measuring apparent and actual solids concentrations in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) downer. A new model to predict pressure drops due to friction between the gas–solid suspension in the fully developed zone and the downer wall was developed. The results show that the friction between the gas–solid suspension and the downer wall causes a significant deviation of the apparent solids concentrations from the actual ones, especially for those operating conditions with higher superficial gas velocities and solids circulation rates. When the superficial gas velocity is greater than 8 m/s, the actual solids concentrations in the fully developed region of the downer can be up to two to three times of the apparent values. Particle diameters have different influences on the frictional pressure drops under different superficial gas velocity. After the frictional pressure drop is considered, the predicted actual solids concentrations by the proposed model agree well with the experimental values.},

  abstract      = {In literature little attempt has been made to verify experimentally Eulerian-Eulerian gas-solid model simulations of bubbling fluidised beds with existing correlations for bubble size or bubble velocity. In the present study, a CFD model for a free bubbling fluidised bed was implemented in the commercial code CFX of AEA Technology. This CFD model is based on a two fluid model including the kinetic theory of granular flow. Simulations of the bubble behaviour in Ruidised beds at different superficial gas velocities and at different column diameters are compared to the Darton et al. ( 1977) equation for the bubble diameter versus the height in the column and to the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation, corrected for the two dimensional geometry using the bubble rise velocity correlation of Pyle and Harrison ( 1967). It is shown that the predicted bubble sizes are in agreement with the Darton et al. (1977) bubble size equation. Comparison of the predicted bubble velocity with the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation shows a deviation for the velocity of smaller bubbles. To explain this, the predicted bubbles are divided into two bubble classes : bubbles that have either coalesced, broken-up or have touched the wall, and bubbles without these occurrences. The bubbles of this second class are in agreement with the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation. Fit parameters of Hilligardt and Werther (1986) are compared to the fit parameters obtained in this work. It is shown that coalescence, break-up, and direct wall interactions are very important effects, often dominating the dynamic bubble behaviour, but these effects are not accounted for by the Hilligardt and Werther (1986) equation. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Experimental data on pressure, voidage, and bed height fluctuations, and the power spectral density are compared with three different implementations of the Lagrangian–Eulerian model. Though qualitative trends found in the experiment are correctly reproduced by the simulations, it is found that the simulations are particularly sensitive to porosity estimation procedures used in the three different simulation strategies employed. Furthermore, the phenomenon of particle clustering predicted by the model does not conform to experimental observations; this is because the physics of the break-up of clusters is not properly captured in the Lagrangian-Eulerian model. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

While chemical engineering textbooks provide theoretical knowledge on crystallization and nucleation theories, they often fall short in providing provide practical insights on the nucleation mechanism. To bridge this gap, we introduced a virtual experiment on nucleation in second-year chemical engineering classrooms. The main goal is to educate students on crystallization procedures in research and process industries, teaching them how to analyse and manage collected data while integrating theoretical knowledge. This includes conveying the kind of information that can be obtained from a crystallisation process and instructing students on how to analyse and manage the data collected in the light of the theories learned. We devised an original chemical engineering problem on nucleation, derived directly from the raw data collected in the classroom from virtual experiments. This method differs from the conventional approach of solving standard textbook problems. The textbook problems, regrettably often lack crucial information on how nucleation rate or surface free energy are directly obtained from raw data. By the conclusion of the virtual experiment, students have acquired a comprehensive understanding encompassing both practical and theoretical aspects of crystallization, with a particular focus on nucleation. The methodologies elucidated in this study can be applied across a spectrum of chemical engineering modules, including process engineering, unit operations in chemical engineering, mass transfer, and can even be integrated into specialized courses dedicated to crystallization.},

  abstract      = {Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) are versatile and efficient computational techniques to solve flow problems in complex geometric configurations that retain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. Although these methods became known in the 1970s and gained credibility only in the new millennium, they had already been conceived and implemented at the beginning of the 1960s, even if the early computers of those times did not allow researchers to exploit their potential. Nowadays IBMs are established numerical schemes employed for the solution of many complex problems in which fluid mechanics may account for only part of the multiphysics dynamics. Despite the indisputable advantages, these methods also have drawbacks, and each problem should be carefully analyzed before deciding which particular IBM implementation is most suitable and whether additional modeling is necessary. High–Reynolds number flows constitute one of the main limitations of IBMs owing to the resolution of thin wall shear layers, which cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries. To alleviate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies, although in these cases possible pitfalls must also be considered.},

  abstract      = {The rheological characteristics of untreated and dilute acid pretreated corn stover (CS) slurries at high solids concentrations were studied under continuous shear using plate–plate type measurements. Slurry rheological behavior was examined as a function of insoluble solids concentration (10–40\%), extent of pretreatment (0–75\% removal of xylan) and particle size (-20 and -80 mesh). Results show that CS slurries exhibit shear-thinning behavior describable using a Casson model. Further, results demonstrate that the apparent viscosity and yield stress increase with increasing solids concentration (which corresponds to a decrease in free water). Dilute acid pretreatment leads to lower viscosity and yield stresses at equivalent solids concentrations, as does smaller particle size. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the availability of free water in the slurry plays a significant role in determining its rheological behavior. In particular, as the free water content of the slurry decreases, e.g., with increasing solids concentration, the greater interaction among particles likely increases the apparent viscosity and yield stress properties of the slurry. The results also suggest that the availability of free water, and thereby slurry rheological properties, depend on the chemical composition of the corn stover as well as its physical characteristics such as particle size and porosity. Hydrophilic polymers within the cell wall, such as xylan or pectin, or larger pores within bigger particles, facilitate sequestration of water in the solid phase resulting in decreased availability of free water. Thus, dilute acid pretreated slurries, which contain smaller size particles having significantly lower xylan content than slurries of untreated milled stover, exhibit much lower viscosities and yield stresses than untreated slurries containing large particles at similar solid concentrations.},

  abstract      = {Using the action of the ultrasonic field on an aqueous medium with organic polymers, it is possible to influence the intensification of the processes of discoloration and coagulation of fine suspension with subsequent filtration. It is emphasized that the physical methods of water purification include fields - pulsed, magnetic, high-frequency, X-ray, ultraviolet. It is shown that the ultrasonic field has the following effects in an aqueous medium: dispersion and emulsification, coagulation, degassing, crystallization and dissolution, oxidation, reduction, polymerization. The literature sources are given, in which the beginning of the study of various chemical effects arising in the ultrasonic field is noted. Materials have been collected showing the results of experiments with ultrasonic frequencies. In an aqueous environment with the participation of ultrasound, reactions are possible: - synthesis and decomposition of organic and inorganic compounds; - reduction reactions and oxidation reactions; - with macromolecules and ultrasonic vibrations, depolymerization or polymerization processes are accelerated: - crystallization; - degassing. These reactions occur and are initiated by the phenomenon of cavitation. Cavitation is an increase in the diameter of a spherical cavity of a vapor-air mixture in a certain pressure range. Pulsating cavities with ultrasonic frequency are destroyed in the positive phase. The theories of the existence of ultrasonic cavitation by Napiras and Nolting, Frenkel, Lopyrev are given. According to Frenkel, at the moment of the formation of a spherical cavity, an electrical voltage is created inside it. Lopyrev's theory assumes the influence of ultrasound on water from the standpoint of the theory of the ``liquid state''. This model explains the high dipole moment of water. The influence of the ultrasonic field on the water causes the appearance of associations of molecules. In this case, the effect of the orientation of the molecules is detected. The relevance of the work lies in the study of the ultrasonic field in the cavitation mode - for the intensification of water treatment processes, which is within the scientific problem of using physical fields in technological production cycles. The purpose is shown and the task of the work is stated. Information is provided on the scheme of the laboratory device and the procedure for determining the quality of water with ultrasound exposure. The facts of the conducted experimental studies confirming the presence of a cavitation regime in the aquatic environment are presented. The results of experimental work on the ``Jet'' installation together with an ultrasonic reactor in cavitation mode are obtained and described.

CoSs [Current Sheets (CS), magnetic filaments, large amplitude magnetic disturbances, vortices, and shocklets] appear intermittently inside a turbulent plasma and are collectively the locus of magnetic energy transfer (dissipation) into particle kinetic energy, leading to heating and/or acceleration of the latter. CoSs and especially CSs are also evolving and fragmenting, becoming locally the source of new clusters of CoSs. Strong turbulence can be generated by the nonlinear coupling of large amplitude unstable plasma modes, by the explosive reorganization of large-scale magnetic fields, or by the fragmentation of CoSs. A small fraction of CSs inside a strongly turbulent plasma will end up reconnecting. Magnetic Reconnection (MR) is one of the potential forms of energy dissipation of a turbulent plasma. Analyzing the evolution of CSs and MR in isolation from the surrounding CoSs and plasma flows may be convenient for 2D numerical studies, but it is far from a realistic modeling of 3D astrophysical, space, and laboratory environments, where strong turbulence can be exited, such as in the solar wind, the solar atmosphere, solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections, large-scale space and astrophysical shocks, the magnetosheath, the magnetotail, astrophysical jets, and Edge Localized Modes in confined laboratory plasmas (tokamaks).},

  abstract      = {Turbulence characteristics of vertical air–solid pipe flow are investigated in this paper. Direct numerical simulations of the gas phase have been performed, while the solid particles have been simulated by a Lagrangian approach, including particle collisions. The modelling of wall roughness is shown to be important to obtain agreement with experimental data. Reynolds stresses and Reynolds stress budgets are given for both phases and for a wide range of solid–air mass load ratios (mass loads), varying from 0.11 to 30. Air turbulence intensities, Reynolds shear stress, and turbulence production reduce with increasing mass load. The mean air profile does not alter for low mass loads. In this regime, a simple theory predicts that the reduction of air turbulent production relative to unladen turbulent production is approximately equal to the mass load ratio. The insight that the solids Reynolds shear stress can be significant, even for low mass loads, is essential for this explanation. It is shown that at least two mechanisms cause the turbulence reduction. In addition to the classically recognized mechanism of dissipation of turbulent fluctuations by particles, there is another suppressing mechanism in inhomogeneous flows: the non-uniform relative velocity of the phases, created because particles slip at the wall, collide, and slowly react with the continuous phase. Investigation of the air turbulent kinetic energy equation demonstrates that the relative reduction of air pressure strain is larger than the reduction of turbulent production and dissipation, and pressure strain may therefore be a cause of the reduction of the other quantities. The fluctuational dissipation induced by the drag forces from particles is small compared to the other terms, but not negligible. For intermediate and high mass loads the air turbulence remains low. The relatively small turbulence intensities are not generated by the standard turbulent mechanisms any more, but directly caused by the particle motions. The particle–fluid interaction term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation is no longer dissipative, but productive instead. On increasing the mass load, the radial and azimuthal fluctuations of the particles grow. The corresponding reduction of solids anisotropy is an effect of the inter-particle collisions, which act as a solids pressure strain term. For intermediate and high mass loads, fluctuational drag force and particle collisions appear to be the relevant dissipation mechanisms in the solids fluctuational energy equation. In contrast to the air turbulent production, the solids `turbulent' production term has the same level for low and high mass loads, while it attains a clear local minimum between. With increasing mass load, large-scale coherent turbulent fluid structures weaken, and eventually disappear. Simultaneously, the fluid fluctuations at relatively small length scales are enhanced by the motion of the particles. The highest particle concentration occurs near the wall for low mass loads, but on increasing the mass load, the concentration profile becomes uniform, while for the highest mass load particles accumulate in the centre of the pipe. Two-point correlation functions indicate that the addition of a small number of small solid particles to a clean pipe flow increases the streamwise length scale of the turbulence.},

  abstract      = {An efficient direct numerical simulation method to tackle the problem of particulate flows at moderate to high concentration and finite Reynolds number is presented. Our method is built on the framework established by Glowinski and his co-workers [Glowinski R, Pan TW, Hesla TI, Joseph DD. A distributed lagrange multiplier/fictitious domain method for particulate flow. Int J Multiphase Flow 1999;25:755–94] in the sense that we use their Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) formulation and their operator-splitting idea but differs in the treatment of particle collisions. Compared to our previous works [Yu Z, Wachs A, Peysson Y. Numerical simulation of particle sedimentation in shear-thinning fluids with a fictitious domain method. J Non Newtonian Fluid Mech 2006;136:126–139; Yu Z, Shao X, Wachs A. A fictitious domain method for particulate flow with heat transfer. J Comput Phys 2006;217:424–52; Yu Z, Wachs A. A fictitious domain method for dynamic simulation of particle sedimentation in Bingham fluids. J Non Newtonian Fluid Mech 2007;145:78–91], the novelty of our present contribution relies on replacing the simple artificial repulsive force based collision model usually employed in the literature by an efficient Discrete Element Method (DEM) granular solver. The use of our DEM solver enables us to consider particles of arbitrary shape (at least convex) and to account for actual contacts, in the sense that particles actually touch each other, in contrast with the repulsive force based collision model. We validate GRIFF,1 our numerical code, against benchmark problems and compare our predictions with those available in the literature. Results, which, to the best of our knowledge, have never been reported elsewhere, on the 2D sedimentation of isometric polygonal particles with collisions are presented.},

  abstract      = {Phase Equilibria in Chemical Engineering is devoted to the thermodynamic basis and practical aspects of the calculation of equilibrium conditions of multiple phases that are pertinent to chemical engineering processes. Efforts have been made throughout the book to provide guidance to adequate theory and practice. The book begins with a long chapter on equations of state, since it is intimately bound up with the development of thermodynamics. Following material on basic thermodynamics and nonidealities in terms of fugacities and activities, individual chapters are devoted to equilibria primarily between pairs of phases. A few topics that do not fit into these categories and for which the state of the art is not yet developed quantitatively have been relegated to a separate chapter. The chapter on chemical equilibria is pertinent since many processes involve simultaneous chemical and phase equilibria. Also included are chapters on the evaluation of enthalpy and entropy changes of nonideal substances and mixtures, and on experimental methods. This book is intended as a reference and self-study as well as a textbook either for full courses in phase equilibria or as a supplement to related courses in the chemical engineering curriculum. Practicing engineers concerned with separation technology and process design also may find the book useful.},

Taking a data-driven approach, we run many offline simulations in advance and train a model to predict the velocity field from the mass distribution and system control signals. Rapid model inference of particle velocities replaces the intense process of computing contact forces and velocity updates. In coupled DEM and multibody system simulation, the predictor model can be trained to output the interfacial reaction forces as well. An adaptive model order reduction technique is investigated, decomposing the media in domains of solid, liquid, and gaseous state. The model reduction is applied to solid and liquid domains where the particle motion is strongly correlated with the mean flow, while resolved DEM is used for gaseous domains. Using a ridge regression predictor, the performance is tested on simulations of a pile discharge and bulldozing. The measured accuracy is about 90\% and 65\%, respectively, and the speed-up range between 10 and 60.},

A mechanistic model of thermocouple measurements in a general gas – solid – droplet three-phase flow was further established for building up the linkage between the averaged mixture temperature and the temperature of each phase as well as for the measurement interpretation. Phase transfer and interactions between the spray and the ambient flow such as entrainment and turbulent transfer across the jet boundary were delineated in the analytical model. The histogram of spray droplet evaporation, the jet boundary expansion, and the phase distributions of velocity, temperature and concentration were predicted. Effects of the ambient flow velocity, solids loading and spray jet mass flow rate on both the jet structure and temperature profiles were illustrated. Unique phenomena such as the shortening of the spray penetration, the ambient temperature reduction, and the ambient gas acceleration were explored and interpreted. The comparison between the modeling predictions and measurements on the mixture temperature profiles suggests that the proposed analytical approach is reasonably correct.},

  abstract      = {As a particle method, macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling (MaPPM) is an effective approach applied to micro-scale simulation of particle–fluid systems. In this paper, a parallel algorithm for macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling based on spatial decomposition (SD) is presented. The parallel implementation utilizes MPI as the programming environment. Due to movement of particles during simulation, the parallelization of MaPPM may suffer from load imbalance and attendant performance degradation. Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB) is adopted to partition the whole computational domain in a dynamic fashion to balance the workload in processors. The Shift scheme is modified to meet the communication requirement in the dynamic partition. The parallel approach was applied to simulation of bubble behavior in gas–solid fluidized beds with different system sizes to test its performance. The computations were conducted on cluster of workstations (COW). Experimental results show that the algorithm has a good scalability. With dynamic load balancing (DLB), the parallel efficiency can be improved by up to 8\%. To sum up, it was a successful implementation for the parallelization of macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling.},

Direct numerical simulation is performed by a compressible code, named S3D. In this paper, the effects of evaporating and non-evaporating droplets on isotropic turbulent flows are investigated. From the simulations it is found that for the case without evaporation, the inclusion of small droplets suppresses the turbulence, while evaporation usually enhances turbulence at later times for higher massloading ratios.},

  abstract      = {Gas–solid two-phase flow features temporal-spatial multi-scale structures. Calculation of characteristic scales for an air/FCC (fluid-catalyticcracking particle) flow indicates that the lack of scale separation entails a structure-dependent modeling approach even on the sub-grid level. For solving this problem, the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is extended and coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) through calculation of a structure-dependent drag coefficient in each grid, for which the schemes EMMS/sub-grid and EMMS/matrix are presented. Numerical analysis of the extended EMMS model suggests that gas and particles tend to achieve a compromise of flow dominance by gas finding the way with less resistance and particles clustering. So the dilute-phase part of drag force can be neglected and the major flow resistance arises from inside the dense-phase aggregate and over the interface. The inertial difference between the dense phase and the interface results in breakup or formation of particle clusters. The integrated approach is further verified through numerical description of the choking point demarcating the flow regime transition between the dilute pneumatic transport and the all-dense flow. Simulation shows that usual practice with assignment of only gas velocity and solids flux is insufficient for determination of the dense bottom height in a riser, and this can be attributed to the absence of another independent variable, solids inventory or imposed pressure drop. This critical phenomenon has been identified by earlier experiments, but most simulation practitioners remain unaware of it. More verification of the model is performed through visualization of micro-scale dynamics, characterization of meso-scale clusters and quantification of macro-scale distribution of two-phase parameters. Good agreement with experimental evidence is quite encouraging even quantitatively.},

To solve this problem, a newly established multi-scale CFD (computational fluid dynamics) approach, which is based on drag correction from the EMMS (energy-minimization multi-scale) model, is used to simulate our experiments about choking and relevant flowregime transitions. The computed flow-regime diagram is described with the functional relation between the imposed pressure drop and the solids flux at given gas flow rates. A bell-shaped area with an abrupt plateau, within which the solids flux equals the saturation carrying capacity and the dense upflow coexists with the dilute pneumatic transport, marks the choking transition in this diagram. The non-choking transition, however, is characterized by a smooth shift from the dilute flow to the dense flow, without an area for coexistence of flow regimes. The critical point, the summit of the bell-shaped area, demarcates between the choking and the non-choking transitions, near which the fluctuation of solids volume fraction reaches a maximum. In general, this CFD simulation of flow regime transitions suggests a good perspective of the EMMS based multi-scale approach.},

Simulation is carried out in a two-dimensional fluidized bed 2.0 m high and 0.3 m wide equipped with a nozzle in the centre at the inlet. Resin, belonging to Geldart B Group, is selected as the solid material. The numerical results show that the solid movement is predominantly upward in the center of the bed, whilst it is primarily downward in the outer region of the bed. Particles exchange between these two regions across their neighboring boundary. Gas interchange between the jet and the emulsion phase becomes obvious with the jet evolution. The time-averaged distributions of gas and solid velocities in the bed are greatly influenced by jet gas velocity, and the effect of the static bed height can be ignored. These numerical computations provide helpful information for designing and scaling up the jetting fluidized bed.},

  abstract      = {Gas–solid two-phase flow in CFB risers is characterized by the clustering of solid particles producing dynamical multi-scale structures, and how to quantify such heterogeneity is a critical yet unsolved issue. Recently, incorporating the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model with Eulerian approach has obtained encouraging results for simulating the hydrodynamics in CFB risers. However, owing to the cluster diameter correlation used, the present model is still limited to the simulation of Geldart A particles. In this study, a stochastic geometry approach named doubly stochastic Poisson processes is used to analyze the fluctuation characteristics of solid concentration in CFB risers, which provides a mean to define the solid concentration inside clusters. The predicted results are validated by experimental data available in literature, and a revised cluster diameter correlation is then proposed for EMMS model previously developed for cocurrent-up gas–solid flow. Following our previous studies, the EMMS model thus improved is incorporated into an Eulerian–Eulerian description of gas–solid flow as a sub-grid scale model for inter-phase drag force, with which the hydrodynamics of both Geldart A and Geldart B particles in CFB risers are simulated. It is shown that the experimentally found S-shaped axial voidage profiles and the choking phenomenon can be well predicted. The computed one-dimensional slip velocities decrease toward the top of the risers and increase with decreasing cross-sectional averaged voidages. The experimentally found dependence of the root mean square of the solid concentration on its mean value at a given position is also well predicted.},

  abstract      = {The upflowing and downflowing particle velocities are investigated by using a two-optical fiber probe system in the dense gas-solid fluidized bed with an inner diameter of 0.185 m and a height of 3.000 m. Two kinds of glass ballotinis, belonging to Geldart type B classification, are selected as solid material. Experiments are conducted under different operating gas velocities, static bed heights, and particle diameters. The results indicate that the upflowing particle velocity is a strong function of operating gas velocity and particle diameter, while the downflowing particle velocity depends mainly on the operating gas velocity. When the ratio of the operating gas velocity to the minimum fluidization velocity of the particles keeps the same constant, the effect of the particle diameter on the upflowing and downflowing particle velocities can be ignored. Both direction and size of the solid particle velocity are related to the bubble behaviors in the fluidized bed, and the upflowing particle velocity is lower than the bubble rise velocity. Furthermore, the across-sectional, non-uniform flow structure in the bed increases slightly with increasing static bed height at the high operating gas velocity.},

Geldart group B particles with mean diameters of 140 \mathrm{\mu}m and densities of 2700 kg/m3 were used as bed materials. Flow behaviors were investigated with the solid mass flux ranges from 108 to 395 kg/m2 and the superficial gas velocity ranges from 7.6 to 10.2 m/s. The pressure drop, apparent solids holdups, average slip velocity and solids-to-air mass flow ratio under different operating conditions were obtained. The results showed that the riser total pressure drop increased sharply with bed height in the low elevation but slowly in the high elevation, since the solids holdup was higher in the low region than that in the high region. The solids holdup increased with the increasing of solids mass flux while it decreased with increasing superficial gas velocity. A dense suspension upflow flow (DSU) structure was found only existing in the low elevation while the rest upper region was still in the dilute phase, and the length of DSU flow structure increased with solids mass flux. The average slip velocity was found to be the strong function of apparent solids holdup; increasing apparent solids holdup leads to the increase of slip velocity. The riser total pressure drop and apparent solids holdup increase with the solids-to-air mass flow ratio.},

Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), a cross-sectional imaging technique, has been used to measure the dilute flow in a large square CFB. A sensor has been specifically designed for the measurement and a new algorithm has been developed for image reconstruction. Flow conditioning parts (internals) are designed and placed inside the CFB, aiming to enhance the contact between gas and particles in the dilute gas–solids flow. The dynamic characteristics and detailed information were obtained on two sections in the bed at different height. The performance of the internals is related to their size, combination, height in the bed and the superficial gas velocity. It has been confirmed that a particular combination of internals can increase the solids concentration in the central area of a cross-section, and can improve the probability density distribution (PDD) with a moderate gas velocity. Using a combination of a large internal at an upper location and a small one at a lower location can optimise the flow in the CFB.},

The computed results indicate that the mass transfer of air to particles in the cluster is reduced due to the particle clustering and increments of particle size and temperature. Influences of the porosity of the cluster, inlet gas velocity and temperature on mass transfer of air to the cluster are analyzed. The mass transfer coefficients of gas to cluster increase with the increase of porosity of the cluster and inlet air velocity, but decrease with the particle diameter. The downmoving cluster gives higher mass transfer than that of the upward moving cluster.

  abstract      = {Meso-scale structure is of critical importance to circulating fluidized bed (CFB) applications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with consideration of meso-scale structures can help understand the structure-oriented coupling between flow, heat/mass transfer and reactions. This article is to review our recent progress on the so-called multiscale CFD (MSCFD), which characterizes the sub-grid meso-scale structure with stability criteria in addition to conservation equations. It is found that the mesh-independent solution of fine-grid two-fluid model (TFM) without sub-grid structures is inexact, in the sense that it overestimates the drag coefficient and fails to capture the characteristic S-shaped axial profile of voidage in a CFB riser. By comparison, MSCFD approach in terms of EMMS/matrix seems to reach a meshindependent solution of the sub-grid structure, and succeeds in predicting the axial profile and flow regime transitions. Further application of MSCFD finds that neglect of geometric factors is one of the major reasons that cause disputes in understanding the flow regime transitions in a CFB. The operating diagram should, accordingly, include geometric factors besides commonly believed operating parameters for the intrinsic flow regime diagram. Recent extension of MSCFD to mass transfer finds that Reynolds number is insufficient for correlating the overall Sherwood number in a CFB. This is believed the main reason why the conventional correlations of Sherwood number scatter by several orders of magnitude. Certain jump change of state of motion around Reynolds number of 50–100 can be expected to clarify the abrupt decay of Sherwood number in both classical- and circulating-fluidized beds. Finally, we expect that the real-size, 3-D, full-loop, time-dependent multiscale simulation of CFB is an emerging paradigm that will realize virtual experiment of CFBs.},

The photocatalytic efficiency for this transformation largely depends on CO2 adsorption and diffusion. However, the CO2 adsorption on the surface of photocatalysts is generally low due to their low specific surface area and the lack of matched pores. Here we report a well-defined porous hypercrosslinked polymer-TiO2-graphene composite structure with relatively high surface area i.e., 988\,m2\,g-1 and CO2 uptake capacity i.e., 12.87\,wt\%. This composite shows high photocatalytic performance especially for CH4 production, i.e., 27.62\,\ensuremath{\mu}mol\,g-1\,h-1, under mild reaction conditions without the use of sacrificial reagents or precious metal co-catalysts. The enhanced CO2 reactivity can be ascribed to their improved CO2 adsorption and diffusion, visible-light absorption, and photo-generated charge separation efficiency. This strategy provides new insights into the combination of microporous organic polymers with photocatalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion.},

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keyword frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.},

This review summarizes recent progress in applying phase-field simulation to investigate the effect of alloy composition and casting process parameters on the solidification structure of metals. The effects of several typical elements and process parameters, including carbon, boron, silicon, cooling rate, pulling speed, scanning speed, anisotropy, and gravity on the solidification structure are discussed.

  abstract      = {With the rapid development of flexible electronics, a large amount of electronic waste is becoming a global concern. Because of the biodegradable and environment-friendly properties, cellulose paper as flexible substrates is an alternative pathway to effectively address the electronic pollution. Recently, paper-based piezoresistive pressure sensors with a simple structure and easy signal detection have been widely used in health monitoring, soft robots, and so forth. However, the low sensitivity and narrow working range of paper-based sensors limit their practical applications. Here, an all paper-based piezoresistive pressure sensor is successfully constructed by assembling a bottom electrode with a screen-printed interdigital Cu electrode on paper and a top sensing electrode. The top electrode is simply fabricated using a one-step impregnation method to coat a thin poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer on air-laid paper. The constructed all-paper sensor displays a maximum sensitivity of 768.07 kPa–1, a wide detection range (up to 250 kPa), and excellent cycle stability (5000 cycles). Furthermore, the sensor can clearly respond from low pressure (such as wrist pulse) to high pressure (finger tapping). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the surface and interface design of rough and fiber-structured paper and the high conductivity of copper and PEDOT:PSS. Finally, based on the printing technology, array sensors are fabricated to identify spatial pressure distributions, demonstrating the capability of low-cost and large-area fabrication for the practical production applications. This printable all-paper sensor with excellent sensing performance exhibits great potential for use in new-generation green and portable electronics.},

In this work, we proposed random forest (RF) models to predict the densities and the surface tensions of DESs, which are essential for the separation process. In the proposed models, the structural information and the calculated critical properties were used as two different types of features, respectively.

The open-source CFD solver OpenFoam is adopted because further model improvement is straightforward. The hydrodynamics, cavity volume, and cavitation shedding frequency are compared between different simulations.

We establish a connection between the collective dynamics of the pillars and that of electrons in a magnetic field by developing a tight-binding model and a WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) analysis. This enables us to predict the topological pumping pattern, which we validate through numerical and experimental steering of waves from one edge to the other. Furthermore, we observe the immune nature of the topologically pumped surface waves to disorder and defects. The combination of surface patterning and WKB analysis provides a versatile platform for controlling surface waves and exploring topological matter in higher dimensions.},

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

Based on the dataset, we conduct an in-depth benchmarking study of representative open-source and proprietary LLMs with various prompting strategies. The results reveal that the current LLMs fall short of delivering satisfactory performance, with the best overall score of merely 43.22\%. Furthermore, through a detailed user study, we categorize the errors made by LLMs into ten problem-solving abilities. Our analysis indicates that no single prompting strategy significantly outperforms the others and some strategies that demonstrate improvements in certain problem-solving skills could result in declines in other skills. We envision that SciBench will catalyze further developments in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, thereby ultimately contributing to scientific research and discovery.},

The rotational speed, flow rate and inlet pressure significantly affect the cavitation patterns, resulting in different degradation characteristics of MB, the degradation rate of MB increases when the shedding frequency of shear cavitation is intensified.

The research focuses on three areas: the plasma mainstream section, the circumferential jet mixing chamber, and the reaction chamber. We investigate the characteristics of the mainstream and explore the impact of the jet momentum ratio on the mixing process and the losses from methane heating. We explain these phenomena using Damkohler numbers to demonstrate the relationship from a time-scale perspective. The findings indicate that an increased momentum ratio improves mixing, reduces temperature and material non-uniformity, and minimizes losses from pyrolysis during methane heating. Additionally, we provide a formula for calculating the penetration depth of the jet. The examination of Damkohler numbers also suggests that the momentum ratio primarily reduces methane losses by extending the reaction time scale. This work offers guidance on extending the usage of plasma heaters and integrating them into other industry processes in the future.},

  abstract      = {Cavitation in tubes is a common occurrence in nature and engineering applications. Previous studies of cavitation bubble dynamics mainly consider bubbles in stagnant-water tubes, but the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in tubes with flow is not clear. This study investigates the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in tubes with flow by numerical simulations. The results show that, unlike bubbles in stagnant-water tubes, bubbles under the combined effects of water inflow and tube wall confinement exhibit asymmetric behavior along the axis of the tube. The inflow suppresses the development of the bubble interface near the tube inlet, causing that side of the interface to move with the inflow. In contrast, the expansion and contraction of the bubble and the generation of liquid jets occur on the side near the outlet. This feature results in significant asymmetry in the bubble interface; therefore, we introduce a skewness parameter to characterize the difference in length between the left and right parts of the bubble during the bubble evolution. The evolution of the bubble significantly affects the mass flow rate at the outlet of the tube, and even leads to backflow during the bubble contraction process.},

  abstract      = {This article details the construction of an experimental visualization platform for observing cavitation. The platform uses high-speed photography and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques to conduct experimental research into the flow pattern and vortex field of cavitation in Venturi tubes. Dynamic mode decomposition is employed to extract the energy distribution characteristics of the cavitation flow field. Cavitation occurs at an exit-to-inlet pressure ratio of 0.595, and the length of the cavitation zone increases as this ratio decreases. When the pressure ratio reaches 0.280, the flow rate remains almost constant and the flow becomes chocked. The cavitation shape evolves periodically in the chocking flow, and the cavitation zone can be divided into three parts: an initiation and development area, a fusion area, and a collapse area. The fusion area exhibits periodic changes in the form of contraction, expansion, and re-contraction. Near the wall, the collapse area exhibits complex boundary conditions, with re-entrant jet causing bubble aggregation, rolling, and shedding. PIV and energy extraction reveal that vortices primarily appear near the wall, where they undergo a periodic process of fragmentation and fusion. The strength of the vortices exhibits a small–large–small pattern that is related to the cloud aggregation, rolling, and shedding caused by the re-entrant jet.},

Some of the pitfalls and limitations of various laboratory reactors are discussed for some typically complex industrial reaction systems. A modus operandi is suggested for choosing from among the potential reactors those that have the best chance of supplying the desired data. As is typical of many complex industrial reaction systems, no one reactor turns out to be ideal and many times the building of two or more types is advantageous.},

For these reactor configurations conventional plug flow models and pseudo-homogeneous kinetic models fail. An adequate modeling can be carried out with full computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in combination with detailed reaction mechanisms. In this study, a full three-dimensional fixed-bed reactor for the catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) over rhodium was simulated with a detailed reaction mechanism. The bed consists of 113 spherical solid particles in which thermal conductivity was considered. Two different Reynolds numbers were investigated, i.e., 35 and 700. The simulated DRM fixed-bed reactor demonstrates the strong interaction between chemical kinetics and transport of momentum, heat and mass. The observed velocity, temperature and species fields are characterized by their three-dimensional behavior and interactions highlighting their complexity and discrepancy from lumped model predictions. In addition, the reaction mechanism determines regions with catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition. This study demonstrates the advantages of modeling heterogeneous catalytic fixed-bed reactors with small N fully in three-dimensional in combination with detailed reaction mechanisms. Finally, this modeling approach reduces dependencies on empiricism for the calculation of multiscale reaction devices.},

The coefficient of restitution is shown to be an approximate function of the ratio of the relative impact velocity to the system compressional wave speed, and the ratio of yield pressure to Young's modulus. The system compressional wave speed is further a function of the relative radii of the impacting particles, and it is predicted that the coefficient of restitution for equally sized sphere–sphere impacts is about 19\% small than for sphere–plate impacts of otherwise identical particles. This result is confirmed experimentally. Theory is also developed to quantify an increase in restitution coefficient following identical impacts at the same point. Progressive plastic deformation about the impact point leads to a collision that is increasingly more elastic, and the restitution coefficient for typical particles approaches unity after about five to 10 impacts. This is also approximately confirmed experimentally.},

The shape and size of the catalyst particles are the key factors affecting the pressure drop of the fixed bed reactor. In this work, the effect of hollow structure of honeycomb catalyst pellets (one type of pellets commonly used in the industry) on the pressure drop in packed bed reactors is investigated by using particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics (PRCFD). Firstly, the PRCFD model built in this work is validated by comparing with the voidages and pressure drops obtained from experiments. The deviation between the pressure drops calculated by PRCFD model and obtained from experiments is less than 5\%, proving the rationality and accuracy of the PRCFD model. Then, the effect of pore number is investigated. The results show that pore number only very slightly affects the voidage but significantly affects the pressure drop under the same volumes of pore and catalyst. With the increase of pore number, the pressure drop goes up, as the loss of momentum is higher when fluid flows through a smaller pore. Eventually, the effect of pore structure of a Raschig ring catalyst pellet is studied. The voidage and pressure drop can be significantly regulated by adjusting outer cylinder radius, inner pore radius, and height. When the wall of the Raschig ring is thinner, the voidage is higher, resulting in the lower pressure drop. This work can provide a powerful model and some theoretical guidance for the optimal design of catalyst pellet shape.},

  abstract      = {Based on the assumption of a core-annulus structure, radial gas mixing characteristics were experimentally studied in the core of the upper dilute zone of a pilot scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB), 0.4 m in diameter and 9 m in height. CO2 as a tracer was injected continuously into the center of the bed by a point source. Radial tracer gas concentration profiles were measured in several planes downstream of the injection point. An analytical solution derived by Klinkenberg et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem., 6 (1953) 1202) [l] for the description of gas mixing in turbulent single phase flow was successfully applied to determine the Peclet number, Pe,., for radial gas mixing in the core zone. Pe, c was found to be independent of the superficial gas velocity u, which is in agreement with the gas mixing beha;iour in turbulent single phase flow. A mean value of Per,. =465, which is also in agreement with other authors' measurements in single phase flow, was calculated from measurements at different solids rates G,, up to 70 kg m-' s-l. The fact that Pe,. was found to be independent of G, is attributed to the low mean solids concentration in the core zone and to the size of the particles, which is too small to cause a significant influence on the turbulent intensity of the gas phase.},

  abstract      = {In this study, an attempt has been made to compare an intrusive solids velocity measurement technique with the laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) which is a typical non-intrusive solids velocity measurement technique. Single-fibre reflection (SFR) probe and LDA measurements were directly compared under identical operating conditions in the upper dilute zone of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB). This experimental unit was a cold model CFB (inner diameter of the riser, 0.4 m; height, 15.6 m). The measurements were taken at a height of 6 m above the distributor. Quartz sand with a mean diameter of 166 \mathrm{\mu}m was fluidized at a superficial gas velocity of 4 m s -1. The cross-sectional average solids volume concentration was 1.2 vol.\%. The highest instantaneous local solids concentration was 5 vol.\% close to the riser wall. LDA measurements were taken with a miniaturized measuring head (diameter, 14 mm) operating in the backscatter mode and inserted in a probe casing (diameter, 22 mm). The focal point of the laser beams was located at a distance of 19 mm from the probe casing window. This allows the LDA measuring head to be moved through the fluidized bed and valid LDA measurements to be acquired inside relatively dense suspensions. The fibre-optical probe measurements were taken with a two-channel SFR probe (fibre: diameter, 600 \mathrm{\mu}m; probe: diameter, 8 mm; centre-to-centre distance between the two sensing surfaces, 2.3 mm). The measurements at a superficial gas velocity of 4 m s -1 showed mean solids velocities between 10 m s -1 upwards and 3ms-1 downwards. The LDA system faces problems in the regions of higher solids concentration located close to the riser wall where data acquisition rates decrease considerably. The good agreement between the local average solids velocities acquired with the two systems proves that intrusive probe measurements cause negligible distortion of the solids velocity Pattern in a CFB environment.},

In the present paper an overview is given on available measuring techniques. In the first section techniques for industrial routine measurements are discussed. These are mainly temperature and pressure drop measurements. Practical applications and also the limitations of these techniques are outlined. In the second section more sophisticated techniques for local measurements inside fluidized bed systems, which have already proven their suitability in large-scale industrial reactors, are dealt with. Examples include suction probes for measurements of local solids mass flows, heat transfer probes for the detection of defluidized zones and solids flows inside fluidized-bed reactors and capacitance probes for solids concentration and velocity measurements under high-temperature conditions. The third section finally presents advanced techniques which are either still under development or which are particularly intended for academic investigations of basic fluidization phenomena. Examples include sensor techniques, imaging and tomographic methods. q 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

An array of thermistor probes measures the spread of the tracer. A series of experiments has been done in the upper core region of a 7 m tall, 0.20 m diameter test circulating fluidized bed (CFB). The experiments involved one type of particle, having 180 /\textasciitilde m diameter and 2350 kg/m3 density. Models for the spread of tracer particles, transfer of heat from tracer particles to surrounding gas and particles, and for heat transfer to the thermistors were used to make estimates of the radial particle ditfusivity in the core region. The diffusivity was on the order of 10 crn2/s for the range of velocities and solid concentrations tested. A second set of preliminary solid mixing experiments has been done in the bottom of a 1.8 m tall, 0.16 m square CFB using 55 /xm FCC (fluid cracking catalyst) particles. The mixing in this region, although not representative of a strictly diffusional process, appears to be somewhat more vigorous than the core mixing in the upper region of the bed.},

  abstract      = {Amine-infused hydrogels provide a facile platform for developing solid sorbents with improved CO2 capture performance relative to that of their liquid counterparts. In this study, we develop hydrogel materials that can be easily manufactured at a large scale and have high flow gas permeability characteristics, fast uptake kinetics, and minimal performance degradation after recycling, properties which are particularly important for applications in direct air capture (DAC). To overcome water loss issues associated with hydrogel materials for DAC, we have introduced high-boiling-point/nonaqueous solvent systems, which significantly lowered the solvent loss, leading to dramatically improved recyclability. Among the materials developed, cross-linked poly(N-2-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (PHEAA) infused with diethanolamine (DEA) exhibited 7.82 and 2.90 wt \% CO2 uptake with pure CO2 and DAC, respectively. Interestingly, by changing the hydrogel platform between either a cross-linked superabsorbent [i.e., poly(acrylamide/sodium acrylate)], PHEAA, or poly(acrylamide) (PolyAA) and impregnating with different amines/solvents, the uptake kinetics could be controlled and significantly improved. In fact, the PolyAA system impregnated with DEA in ethylene glycol showed 90\% of the total capacity (6.37\%) in 350 s (vs 4300 s in the case of the PHEAA/DEA system) as well as an enhanced amine efficiency (0.76 vs 0.28 mol CO2 per amine). Thus, this study demonstrates the use of different nonaqueous solvents on readily synthesized hydrogel platforms to improve the DAC uptake efficiency and kinetics. The fast kinetics enable shorter adsorption/desorption cycles, which will be advantageous in improving the CO2 uptake selectivity and reducing the sorption of water in larger-scale implementations of this approach, in both urban and industrial applications.},

  abstract      = {Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) uses hydrogen as fuel to generate electricity and by-product water at relatively low operating temperatures, which is environmentally friendly. Since PEMFC performance characteristics are inherently nonlinear and related, predicting the best performance for the different operating conditions is essential to improve the system's efficiency. Thus, modeling using artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict its performance can significantly improve the capabilities of handling multi-variable nonlinear performance of the PEMFC. This paper predicts the electrical performance of a PEMFC stack under various operating conditions. The four input terms for the 5~W PEMFC include anode and cathode pressures and flow rates. The model performances are based on ANN using two different learning algorithms to estimate the stack voltage and power. The models have shown consistently to be comparable to the experimental data. All models with at least five hidden neurons have coefficients of determination of 0.95 or higher. Meanwhile, the PEMFC voltage and power models have mean squared errors of less than 1~\texttimes{}~10-3 V and 1~\texttimes{}~10-3 W, respectively. Therefore, the model results demonstrate the potential use of ANN into the implementation of such models to predict the steady state behavior of the PEMFC system (not limited to polarization curves) for different operating conditions and help in the optimization process for achieving the best performance of the system.},

In this review, we broadly and deeply review more than 10,000 papers and extract the hidden trends of carbon capture and absorbent regeneration in the past few decades, using a novel data-mining analysis technique. We comprehensively analyzed an array of recent absorbent regeneration methods utilized in postcombustion, precombustion, carbon capture from industrial point sources, and direct air carbon capture, with an emphasis on sorbent and solvent-based techniques.

Processing wet solids through a process like hydrothermal liquifaction to produce upgradeable bio-oil is one pathway that could transform high moisture waste into a fuel. This work pioneers two green processing pathways to produce a biomass feedstock for liquefaction that is far less viscous at higher solids loadings than traditional slurries. This decrease in viscosity could significantly improve the profitability of producing fuels through slurry-based conversion processes. Natural biological degradation of corn stover before grinding has been shown to lower slurry viscosity by a factor of three and torrefaction has been shown to produce slurries that are 150x less viscous than the original material. Additionally, new insight has been gained into the critical physical and chemical parameters that impact slurry viscosity. Common parameters in slurry processing, like the average particle size, shear rate, and solids loadings clearly control viscosity, and these results are confirmed for biomass. Additionally, new physical parameters like aspect ratio and sphericity, as well as chemical parameters like extractives content, non-structural sugars, and zeta potential have been shown to impact and be good predictors of slurry viscosity and processability.},

Chemical and process engineering students need to be equipped to adopt innovative approaches to resource processing, energy management and technological application in complex, ill-defined problem-solving professional contexts. This paper argues that a key factor in attracting and retaining students is to enable a shift in their perception of the field in both the curricular and professional spaces. The Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) analytical tool called the `epistemic plane' is used to demonstrate the analysis of the theory-practice divide evident between the chemical engineering curriculum at a South African university and industrial sites. An initiative to enable final year Bachelor's students to visit a range of mineral processing sites as part of their research projects, demonstrates that exposure to personnel and industrial processes is effective in changing their perception of the field, and thus successfully contributes to potential retention and employment in a field necessary to advance sustainable development goals.},

  abstract      = {For almost 4 years professional institutions involved in accrediting university Chemical Engineering programs have used what is known as "Output Driven Accreditation" guidelines. The concept is that chemical engineering graduates should acquire certain graduate attributes as they progress through the university program (normally of 4 years duration). The lecture summarises the concepts of graduate attributes (outputs) and considers how selected university chemical engineering programs from a number of countries align with professional accreditation requirements. It is of concern that a number of programs do not comply with some of the key outputs that the profession promotes. As an example, we are living in the age of sustainability and responsible chemical engineering professional bodies require that graduates are fully aware of the essential principles of sustainability. There is good evidence that students and graduates in a number of countries have only a very limited knowledge at best, of these principles. There is no doubt that many chemical engineers in industry have only a passing knowledge of the true fundamentals of sustainability and their responsibility in this area. An important consequence of an "output driven" accreditation system is that course curricula are not prescribed for accreditation giving the teaching institution much greater flexibility than hitherto. Hence we can expect to see more specialities arising in chemical engineering programs with full accreditation. An undergraduate program specialising in biomolecular engineering would be expected to arise alongside a traditional chemical engineering undergraduate program both carrying full chemical engineering professional accreditation.},

The focus of the paper is on continuum methods where it covers the three common approaches in the sharp interface limit, namely the volumeof-fluid method with interface reconstruction, the level set method and the front tracking method, as well as methods with finite interface thickness such as color-function based methods and the phase-field method. Variants of the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method for two-fluid flows are also discussed, as well as various hybrid approaches. The mathematical foundation of each method is given and its specific advantages and limitations are highlighted. For continuum methods, the coupling of the interface evolution equation with the single-field Navier–Stokes equations and related issues are discussed. Methods and models for surface tension forces, contact lines, heat and mass transfer and phase change are presented. In the second part of this article applications of the methods in microfluidics and micro process engineering are reviewed, including flow hydrodynamics (separated and segmented flow, bubble and drop formation, breakup and coalescence), heat and mass transfer (with and without chemical reactions), mixing and dispersion, Marangoni flows and surfactants, and boiling.},

Local solids concentration measurements and global differential pressure measurements in the fully developed region were used to estimate the correlation integral. Pressure fluctuations in the fully developed region of the downer showed bi-fractal behavior. Large-scale behavior corresponded to a low correlation dimension, and small-scale behavior corresponded to a high correlation dimension. FCC particles showed more significant bi-fractal behavior than glass beads. Local flow dynamics from solids concentration measurements were contributed by solids flow of many different scales, namely dispersed particles and clusters of different sizes, so that there was only one scaling region in the log–log plot of correlation integral versus distance. Solids flux was found to significantly affect the correlation dimension.},

Both statistical and chaos analysis were employed. Values for the Kolmogorov entropy (K), correlation dimension (D), and Hurst exponent (H) were estimated from time series of solids concentration measurements. Axial distributions of chaos parameters were more complex in the downer than those in the riser, especially in the entrance section. Flow in the downer was more uniform with a flatter core in all the radial profiles of chaos parameters. The radial profiles of K varied significantly with increasing axial levels due to different clustering behavior in the wall region of the downer. In both the riser and the downer, anti-persistent flow in the core region and persistent flow behavior near the wall were identified from the profiles of H. Different flow behavior in the region close to the wall in the downer and riser was characterized from the combination of the three chaos parameters. Relationships between chaos parameters and local time-averaged solids holdup in the core and wall regions of the developed sections in both the downer and riser were also analyzed.},

The paper presents theoretical and experimental investigations on particle rotation speed in the gas--solid flow inside a cold CFB riser. The possible particle rotation speed, caused by non-homogeneous flow field and particle collision, and its variation with time were investigated. The average particle rotation speed was predicted with considerations of particle size, average particle collision velocity, particle collision rate and particle number density. It is found that particle collision is the most significant reason for particle rotation. The maximal and average rotation speed for particles with an average size of several hundred micrometers in the CFB riser under typical working condition may be several thousand revolutions per second and several hundred revolutions per second, respectively. The rotation speed of glass beads with an average size of 500 m in the upper dilute zone of a cold CFB riser was measured by using a high speed digital imaging system. The variation of particle rotation speed with time was observed, which is in accordance with the theoretical result. The average rotation speed for glass beads was statistically analyzed based on a large number of particle examples. With several factors taken into account, the experimental result is considered to agree with the theoretical one.},

The paper presents direct measurements of collision rate as well as collision properties of spherical glass beads with sizes of 500 \pm{} 50 lm in the upper dilute zone of a cold pilot-scale CFB riser, by using a high-speed imaging system. The recording rate of the high-speed digital camera is as high as 5000 fps with a resolution of 640 \^{A} 480. A large number of particle movement images at a height of 3.54 m above the distributor plates were taken. Manual inspection and automatic methods based on digital image processing algorithms were carried out to analyze particle image sequences. The experimental results show that the measured particle collision rate is proportional both to the particles' average relative translational velocity and the square of the particle number density, which coincides with the collision theory derived according to the analogy of kinetic theory of gases. But the theoretical model is found to overestimate the real collision rates, and a coefficient a of 0.33 may be used to correct this discrepancy. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are also discussed. The measurement results of collision properties based on more than 50 particle collision events agrees well with Walton's hard-sphere collision model. The three collision parameters, i.e., the average coefficient of friction l, the normal and tangential coefficients of restitution e and b0, for the glass beads used are measured to be 0.175 \pm{} 0.005, 0.96 \pm{} 0.02, and 0.43 \pm{} 0.09, respectively.},

Hydrodynamics in such a reactor coupling system is studied using a compressive model that considers the pressure balances around all the sub-units in the prototype. The continuity closure condition is used to determine the material balance of the solid particles flowing in the circulating fluidized bed system. The model predictions have good agreement with the experimental data in rather wide operating conditions, e.g., when the solids circulation rate goes to more than 400 kg/m2 s. The effects of the solids inventory, the superficial gas velocity, the particle diameter and density, the inside diameter of risers, and the fractional opening of the control valve for the solids flow on the operation of the DtoR system, are investigated and discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that the model offers appropriate guidance for the design and the operation of the coupled circulating fluidized bed system.},

A coupled high-density downer-to-riser reactor was proposed to utilize the advantages of both downer and riser to improve the gasoline quality and to efficiently control the product distribution. The basic idea is to decompose the complex FCC reactions into two reaction zones with distinct operating conditions. The downer accommodates high-severity operation at the initial stage with the benefit of near plug-flow while the riser is operated at a lower temperature with longer contacting time to promote hydrogen shift reactions. A comprehensive 2D reactor model is presented to predict the reactor performances for different reactor designs.

  abstract      = {The present work demonstrates, for the first time, the development of a computationally efficient closed-loop system with a model predictive controller (MPC) where a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) process model is utilized to represent the process behavior. Specifically, we present the development of a MPC and its implementation within the CFD model of a steam methane reforming reactor, which has been developed and validated in our previous work, to create the CFD-based closed-loop system. Initially, we develop an MPC algorithm using a linear approximation of the dynamics based on the CFD data, and implement it within the CFD simulation as a user-defined function. The MPC accounts for the physical limitations (maximum allowable operating temperature of the outer reforming tube wall) of the reactor as a constraint. We demonstrate the application of the developed MPC within the CFD simulations for a set-point change under the influence of a tube-side feed disturbance. The CFD model determines an optimal outer reforming tube wall temperature trajectory to track the set-point, and the results of the simulation are compared with those resulting from a CFD-based closed-loop simulation under proportional-integral (PI) control.},

  abstract      = {Reversible hydrogen absorption/desorption, the very fundamental property of metal hydrides (MHs), can be utilized to promote the hydrogen absorption of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). The hydrogen absorption of N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) catalyzed by a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was extremely slow, while the process could be significantly enhanced by simply mixing yttrium trihydride (YH3). The hydrogen absorption performance was similar to that on the noble metal catalyst Ru/Al2O3. Using isotope labelling, we demonstrated that the enhanced hydrogen absorption originated from the reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption property of YH3: the atomic hydrogen in YH3 can be transferred to the activated NEC molecules on Ni/Al2O3; subsequently, the hydrogen vacancy left in YH3 is replenished by H2. Inspired by this mechanism, we observed more general MH-promoted hydrogen absorption of LOHCs on transition metal catalysts. The combination of solid MHs and LOHCs with highly complementary merits provides a new strategy to develop high-performance hydrogen storage materials.},

  abstract      = {Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative model for a drastically different shape representation --- describing a shape as a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer. We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset consisting of 178,238 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.},

The application of DEM in the simulating fast fluidization of fine particles in MFB has not yet received attention. This article presents a drag model that relies on the surrounding environment of particles, namely the particle circumstance-dependent drag model or PCDD model. Fast fluidization in an MFB of fine particles is simulated using DEM based on the PCDD model. Simulations indicate that the local structure in an MFB exhibits particle aggregation, which is a natural property of fast fluidization, forming a structure where a continuous dilute phase and dispersed concentrated phase coexist. There exists a strong effect of solid back-mixing in an MFB, leading to relatively low outlet solid flux. The gas back-mixing effect is, however, not so distinct. The axial porosity shows a monotonically increasing distribution with the bed height but does not strictly follow the single exponential distribution. The solid volume fraction at the bottom of the bed is significantly lower than the correlated value in CFB. The axial heterogeneous distribution of the cross-sectional average porosity in the lower half of the bed is also weakened. The radial porosity shows a higher distribution pattern in the central region and a lower one in the sidewall region.},

This study presents a systematic physics-informed machine learning method that integrates transfer learning and labeled data to construct a spatiotemporal model of the PSA process. To approximate the latent solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the specific steps of pressurization, adsorption, heavy reflux, counter-current depressurization, and light reflux, the system's network representation is decomposed into five lightweight sub-networks. On this basis, we propose a parameter-based transfer learning (TL) combined with domain decomposition to address the long-term integration of periodic PDEs and expedite the network training process. Moreover, to tackle challenges related to sharp adsorption fronts, our method allows for the inclusion of a specified amount of labeled data at the boundaries and/or within the system in the loss function. The results show that the proposed method closely matches the outcomes achieved through the conventional numerical method, effectively simulating all steps and cyclic behavior within the PSA processes.},

An improved capillary force model is developed to compute the capillary interactions for partially floating particles at a free surface. Two well-known benchmark cases, namely drag coefficient calculation and the single sphere settling, are conducted to validate the resolved CFD-DEM model. It turns out that the resolved CFD-DEM model developed in this paper can accurately calculate the fluid-solid interactions and predict the trajectory of solid particles interacting with the liquid phase. Numerical demonstrations, namely two particles moving along a free surface when the liquid phase evaporates, and particle transport and accumulations inside an evaporating sessile droplet show the performance of the resolved model.},

Computational fluid dynamics is employed for a Eulerian–Eulerian model, which represents each phase as an interspersed continuum. The transport equation for granular temperature is solved and a hyperbolic tangent function is used to provide a smooth transition between the plastic and viscous regimes for the solid phase. The aim of the present work is to show the range of validity for employing simulations based on a 2D Cartesian coordinate system to approximate both cylindrical and rectangular fluidized beds. Three different fluidization regimes, bubbling, slugging and turbulent regimes, are investigated and the results of 2D and 3D simulations are presented for both cylindrical and rectangular domains. The results demonstrate that a 2D Cartesian system can be used to successfully simulate and predict a bubbling regime. However, caution must be exercised when using 2D Cartesian coordinates for other fluidized regimes. A budget analysis that explains all the differences in detail is presented in Part II to complement the hydrodynamic theory of this paper.},

The individual terms of the governing equations in 2D and 3D simulations with the cylindrical and Cartesian coordinate systems are evaluated in this study through a budget analysis. The additional terms appearing in the 3D equations can be used to explain the discrepancies between 2D and 3D simulations. The values of the additional terms is shown to increase as inlet gas velocity increases. This explains the good agreement between 2D and 3D simulations that is observed for bubbling regimes with low gas velocity, and why the differences between 2D and 3D simulations increases for slugging and turbulent regimes.},

Herein, a family of sponge-like hypercrosslinked imidazolium-based MPILs with different ionic densities were successfully prepared by free-radical polymerization and subsequent supercritical CO2 drying (SCD). Among these MPILs, PVIm-6-SCD from a monomer which was produced from the reaction of 1-vinyl-1H-imidazole with 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis(bromomethyl)benzene and has the highest ionic density (six ion pairs) displayed unprecedentedly high CO2 adsorption: 3.60 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 1 atm. What's more, PVIm-6-SCD, revealed as one of the most efficient catalysts compared to those reported in the literature, can efficiently convert CO2 by cycloaddition with various epoxides into cyclic carbonates at atmospheric pressure, even under relatively low temperature, solvent-free, metal-free and additive-free conditions because of its abundant mesopores providing a large specific surface area and high ionic density providing rich exposed bromide anions as active sites, as well as high CO2 adsorption capacity. Moreover, it can be easily separated with good reusability.

To describe the transition process to turbulence on the stationary side of a closed rotor–stator cavity, a comprehensive approach combining global linear stability analysis with direct numerical simulation was adopted in the present study. The proposed model aligns with that of Yim et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 848, 2018, pp. 631–647), who investigated the stability characteristics of the rotating-disk boundary layer in a rotor–stator cavity. In order to achieve a stable inflow for the stationary-disk boundary layer, we rotate the shroud together with the rotating disk. Through careful global stability analysis, the predominant spiral mode exhibiting the highest instability in the boundary layer of the stationary disk was discerned, corroborating observations from simulations. Initially, the spiral mode undergoes linear amplification, reaches a state of linear saturation and enters the nonlinear regime. Following nonlinear saturation in the flow field, a circular wave mode arises due to the influence of mean flow distortion. As the Reynolds number attained a sufficiently high level, the interplay between the downstream-propagating circular mode and spiral mode amplified disturbances in the boundary layer of the stationary disk, ultimately leading to the development of localised turbulence at the mid-radius of the rotor–stator cavity. Notably, the present study is the first to elucidate the coexistence of laminar–transitional–turbulent flow states in the stationary-disk boundary layer through direct numerical simulations.},

This study investigated the use of HPH or microfluidization as an alternative assisted method for sulforaphane extraction from raw broccoli seeds. The mean particle size, morphological characteristics, and extraction yields of all samples processed at different HPH pressure levels (3000-23,000\,psi) and passes (1–5) were examined. After HPH, the particle size of broccoli seeds was reduced 2–10 times and the particle size distribution pattern also changed from bimodal to unimodal with increasing pressures and number of passes. The highest sulforaphane content obtained with HPH at 5000\,psi and 5 passes was 2199\,\ensuremath{\mu}g sulforaphane/g broccoli seeds, which is 3 times more than the control one. Particular interest was given to the relationship between sulforaphane yield and particle size. Generally, the extraction yield increased with decreasing particle size; however, excessive size reduction did not necessarily result in significant increase in sulforaphane content. In addition, the pressure is not the higher the better ({$<$}8000\,psi, 55\,MPa). Scanning electron morphology (SEM) also confirmed that cell rupture and cell walls breakage occurred during the HPH process.},

However, solving the fluid flow at a grid size of several coarse-grained particles (CGPs) cannot accurately predict the gas–solid interaction, and thus reasonable correction model is required. This study develops a sub-grid model to correct the gas–solid interaction and thereby improve the accuracy of coarse-grid CFD–CGDEM simulation. First, the fluid grids with the size of several CGPs are divided into the auxiliary three-dimensional sub-grids. Then, the CGPs are mapped onto the sub-grids by the weight function to reconstruct the local solid velocities and solid fractions of the sub-grids. After that, the simplified mass and momentum conservation equations are solved to resolve the local gas velocities of sub-grids. Finally, the drag on each CGP is corrected based on the local gas-phase hydrodynamics of sub-grids. Results show that the sub-grid model resolving the local gas velocity in all the three directions works better than that just in the main stream direction. The coarse-grid CFD–CGDEM simulations with this sub-grid model agree well with the experiment for the bubbling, turbulent and rapid fluidized beds. Besides, by solving the simplified conservation equations with graphics processing units, the coarse-grid CFD–CGDEM coupled with the sub-grid model achieves 674 times speedup compared to the fine-grid simulation, demonstrating a much more efficient method to study industrial-scale gas–solid fluidized beds.},

Three different kinds of cluster sizes were distinguished in accordance with the measuring techniques: (1) vertical length measured with optical fiber or capacitance probes; (2) cross-sectional size determined with image analysis of graphs taken by video camera or other suitable detection systems; and (3) hydrodynamic equivalent diameter of clusters derived from differential pressure drop (solid concentration) via appropriate fluid dynamic models. The hydrodynamic equivalent cluster diameter correlated in hydrodynamic modeling was generalized as the diameter of spheres (uniform in size) having the same total volume as actual clusters (not a single cluster), which is subject to hydrodynamic equations, such as force balance, for clusters. It was demonstrated that hydrodynamic equivalent cluster diameter is close to cross-sectional size, but much less than vertical length of clusters experimentally measured. The correlation reported in Xu and Li (1998) (Chem.

Through measuring the lateral distributions of solid concentration in the range \ensuremath{\epsilon}mf\sim{}1.0 of the cross-sectionally averaged voidage, it was found that the first variational stage, from dense uniform (minimum fluidization) to nonuniform, is completed via the rapid decrease of the particle concentration in the bed core, and the succeeding second stage, from nonuniform to dilute uniform (pneumatic transport), is implemented via the quick decrease of the particle concentration near the bed wall. Based on this observation, general correlations were proposed to predict the local voidages on the bed wall (specifically, at the point where the dimensionless radius is equal to 0.99) and at the bed center, which can be used for the entire spectrum of gas–solid fluidization regimes prevailing in CFB risers. Further analyses demonstrated that such two variational regions are related also to the regime transition and the lateral distribution features of the transient solid concentration fluctuations.},

New experiments were conducted to further clarify when and why Ug and Gs alone are insufficient to define the gas – solid flows in such CFB risers. Three different flow patterns, i.e. dilute suspension, axially nonuniform flow and fully dense flow, and their respective parametric dependencies of hydrodynamics are clarified. As a consequence, the article reiterates that the downcomer bed height or solids inventory, and the operational status of the solids flow control valve, including its opening and aeration, have to be specified in addition to Ug and Gs when analyzing the gas – solid flows in CFB risers. This results in the general steps necessary to compute the axial voidage profiles of such risers.},

The fluid flow is distributed within each computational cell from pressure balance considerations according to weighted local porosities, rather than by using traditional linear interpolations. The drag on each particle is then calculated with its local porosity and slip velocity, which shows significant difference to traditional methods. Simulations in this model have reproduced multi-scale flow behaviors in better agreement with experimental results, suggesting the validity of the model. ᭧ 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Most natural resources are processed as particle-fluid multiphase systems in chemical, mineral and material industries, therefore, discrete particles methods (DPM) are reasonable choices of simulation method for engineering the relevant processes and equipments. However, direct application of these methods is challenged by the complex multiscale behavior of such systems, which leads to enormous computational cost or otherwise qualitatively inaccurate description of the mesoscale structures. The coarse-grained DPM based on the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model, or EMMS-DPM, was proposed to reduce the computational cost by several orders while maintaining an accurate description of the mesoscale structures, which paves the way for its engineering applications. Further empowered by the high-efficiency multi-scale DEM software DEMms and the corresponding customized heterogeneous supercomputing facilities with graphics processing units (GPUs), it may even approach realtime simulation of industrial reactors. This short review will introduce the principle of DPM, in particular, EMMS-DPM, and the recent developments in modeling, numerical implementation and application of large-scale DPM which aims to reach industrial scale on one hand and resolves mesoscale structures critical to reaction-transport coupling on the other hand. This review finally prospects on the future developments of DPM in this direction.},

Due to the exceptional selectivity, high adsorption capacity, and long-term stability, solid sorbents are regarded as crucial materials for effective CO2 capture. Machine learning, as an emerging and crucial tool in artificial intelligence, has been adopted for the high-efficient screen of catalysts and sorbents in recent years. By analyzing available data on material properties, machine learning can greatly enhance the effectiveness and precision in identifying high-efficiency CO2 sorbents. This work provides an overview of the latest advancements in the application of machine learning technology in CO2 capture, which specifically focuses on CO2 capture by sorbents. Several machine learning techniques and their applications in different types of CO2 sorbents are fully summarized with concise comments, followed with conclusion and some challenges and perspectives. This review can serve as a guide for the development of carbon capture technology and facilitate the extensive utilization of machine learning technology in environmental protection.},

  abstract      = {There is robust epidemiological evidence for the beneficial effects of broccoli consumption on health, many of them clearly mediated by the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. Present in the plant as its precursor, glucoraphanin, sulforaphane is formed through the actions of myrosinase, a \ensuremath{\beta}-thioglucosidase present in either the plant tissue or the mammalian microbiome. Since first isolated from broccoli and demonstrated to have cancer chemoprotective properties in rats in the early 1990s, over 3000 publications have described its efficacy in rodent disease models, underlying mechanisms of action or, to date, over 50 clinical trials examining pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease mitigation. This review evaluates the current state of knowledge regarding the relationships between formulation (e.g., plants, sprouts, beverages, supplements), bioavailability and efficacy, and the doses of glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane that have been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies. We pay special attention to the challenges for better integration of animal model and clinical studies, particularly with regard to selection of dose and route of administration. More effort is required to elucidate underlying mechanisms of action and to develop and validate biomarkers of pharmacodynamic action in humans. A sobering lesson is that changes in approach will be required to implement a public health paradigm for dispensing benefit across all spectrums of the global population.},

  abstract      = {The interaction between a turbulent gas flow and particle motion was investigated by  numerical simulations of gas–particle turbulent downward flow in a vertical channel.  In particular the effect of inter-particle collision on the two-phase flow field was  investigated. The gas flow field was obtained by large-eddy simulation (LES). Particles  were treated by a Lagrangian method, with inter-particle collisions calculated by a  deterministic method. The spatial resolution for LES of gas–solid two-phase turbulent  flow was examined and relations between grid resolution and Stokes number are  presented. Profiles of particle mean velocity, particle wall-normal fluctuation velocity  and number density are flattened as a result of inter-particle collisions and these  results are in good agreement with experimental measurements. Calculated turbulence  attenuation by particles agrees well with experimental measurements for small Stokes  numbers, but not for large Stokes number particle. The shape and scale of particle  concentrations calculated considering inter-particle collision are in good agreement  with experimental observations.},

  abstract      = {The utilization of machine learning has a potential to improve the environment of the development of antimicrobial agents. For practical use of machine learning, it is important that the conversion of molecules information to an appropriate descriptor because too informative descriptor requires enormous computation time and experiments for gathering data, whereas a less informative descriptor has problems in validity. In this study, we utilized a descriptor only focused on substituent. The type and the position of substituents on the molecules that have a 4-quinolone structure (11,879 compounds) were converted to the combined substituent number (CSN). While the CSN does not include information on the detailed structure, physical properties, and quantum chemistry of molecules, the prediction model constructed by machine learning of CSN indicated a sufficient coefficient of determination (0.719 for the training dataset and 0.519 for the validation dataset). In addition, this CSN can easily construct the unknown molecules library which has a relatively consistent structure by recombination of substituents (32,079,318 compounds) and screening of them. The validity of the prediction model was also confirmed by growth inhibition experiments for E. coli using the model-suggested molecules and commercially available antimicrobial agents.},

Previous literature offers only a very limited knowledge of the detailed solids flow profiles immediately above the solids feeding level and below the exit at the riser top, all with low solids circulation rates of less than 200 kg/m2 s. The study of entrance and exit regions is very valuable for a better understanding of the solids distribution in the high-flux riser. Asymmetry of the radial profiles of solids concentration and particle velocity at both entrance and exit regions are observed under high-flux conditions. Such asymmetry is much stronger under high-flux conditions than under low-flux conditions.},

A suction probe was used for the direct measurement, while the calculated local solids flux data obtained from solids velocity and concentration measured by two separate fibre optic probes were used to compare. Two shapes were found for the radial profile of the solids flux, a parabolic shape and a flat core shape. The shapes obtained could be predicted, based on the operating conditions, using a new concept of the effective solids saturation carrying capacity. The radial profile of solids flux is less uniform in a larger riser than in a smaller riser. Flow development is slower with the increase of riser diameter. The operating conditions were found to affect the solids flux in each reactor in the same general fashion: increasing gas velocity decreased the amount of downflow solids in the risers; increases in the solids circulation rate caused more solids to flow downwards.},

This study proposed a semi-surrogate model for CFD with integration of the cutting-edge ML algorithm, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), which enlightened a possible pathway to effectively and efficiently solve and predict those costly but highly repetitive fluid dynamics-related problems. Droplet evaporation, a complex but essential phenomenon in respiratory droplets transport, was studied as the practical case using the proposed model. Droplets evaporation and dynamic size distributions were firstly tracked under various combinations of indoor humidity and temperature using traditional Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD framework, followed by generating several datasets for XGB training. The trained XGB was then used to interpret the evaporated droplets size over time under new combinations of indoor conditions. Outcomes revealed that well-trained XGB-base semi-surrogate model was capable of interpreting complex non-linear relationships between droplets dynamic parameters (diameter and time) and indoor parameters (humidity and temperature). For each specific parameter, the predictive error of well-trained XGB could retain below 5~\% and its prediction speed was found nearly 1 million times faster than that of new CFD simulations. Successful applications of XGB in conjunction with CFD demonstrated its great potential on providing rapid and more efficient predictions of complex, costly and repetitive fluid dynamics-related phenomenons (e.g. droplets evaporation). Also, the XGB predicted droplets evaporation data from this study could be further applied as initial conditions into new simulations via the User-defined function (UDF).},

Due to the confined effect of the bearing clearance, cavitation bubbles grow in a two-dimensional way. To uncover the cavitation process with confined and high speed shearing effect, the high-speed cavitation flowing of different refrigerants is researched experimentally based on the high-speed shearing test rig with micro-clearance. The influence of thermophysical properties on growth of cavitation bubble is evaluated and analyzed. The confined effect of micro-clearance and high-speed shearing effect has a significant influence on the cavitation bubbles evolution. The high-speed camera is used to record the morphology of cavitation bubbles for various refrigerants with different thermalphysical properties. Furthermore, the thermal-sensitive cavitation model is used to analyze the bubble-foam alternation from cavitation flow inside micro-clearance. For different refrigerants, the growth process of cavitation bubble area is exponential. Inside the micro-clearance, the cavitation inducing pressure drops of different refrigerants are analogous due to the similar thermodynamic properties. According to pressure drop during cavitation, different refrigerants are classified by introducing dimensionless numbers, \ensuremath{\sigma}\cdot{}Re2 and \ensuremath{\sigma}\cdot{}We. The pressure and temperature drop increase with the dimensionless numbers. The refrigerants with similar thermodynamic properties have a similar relationship between dimensionless number and supercooling degree.},

Experiments were carried out in a 140 mm i.d. bed with FCC particles (d, = 54 pm, 6, = 1 54.5 kg m-``) at operating gas velocities ranging from 1.5 to 6.5 m s-l and mass ratio of solid/ gas up to 6. The local particle velocity in a dense riser (mass ratio of solid/gas up to 15) was also determined by a transit time fiber optic probe. The experimental results show that the radial profiles of local slip velocity, gas velocity and particle velocity are all uneven. The radial profiles of gas velocity in the dilute riser are in a form with a higher velocity in the bed center which is 1.5 to 2.0 times the superficial gas velocity and a lower velocity in the wall region which approaches zero. Owing to the uneven distribution and movement of particles and gas, as well as the particles aggregation, the radial profiles of local slip velocity are non-uniform, flat in the central region and steep in the region near the wall, and a higher velocity value appears in the wall region. Experimental results also indicate that the cross-sectional average slip velocity calculated from one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model is far greater than the experimental local slip velocity.},

However, its significant effects on interfacial drag coefficient are seldom taken into account in current computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations by using the two-fluid models. The energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) approach, in which the heterogeneous structure is described by the so-called multi-scale resolution and energy-minimization method, is adapted in this study for investigating the dependence of drag coefficient on structure parameters. The structure-dependent drag coefficients calculated from the EMMS approach are then incorporated into the two-fluid model to simulate the behavior of the concurrent-up gas–solid flow in a riser. Simulation results indicate that the simulated solid concentration with the Wen and Yu/Ergun drag correlations is rather dilute, leading to a more homogenous structure; while the dynamic formation and dissolution of clusters can be captured with the drag correlations derived from the EMMS approach, and the simulated outlet solid flux and voidage profile in both radial and axial directions are in reasonable agreement with experimental results, suggesting the feasibility for the EMMS approach to be used as a sub-grid closure law for drag coefficient.},

Geldart classification of powders does not apply at elevated pressure and temperature. There are ample evidences reported in the literature indicating that normally Geldart Group B powders at ambient conditions, such as polymer particles, can behave like a Group A powder under polymerization conditions at elevated pressure and moderate temperature with substantial emulsion-phase expansion, relatively small bubbles, smooth fluidization, and reduced gas bypassing [J.R.

Herein, we illustrate the influential mechanisms of the pore structure and lithiophilicity on the Li deposition behavior within the 3D porous host through a combination of phase-field simulations and experimental investigation. The optimal pore structure and size are predicted by simulating the Li nucleation and growth processes, which are further experimentally verified. Furthermore, the effect of lithiophilicity on the electrochemical performance of the 3D porous host is clarified by constructing a lithiophilic structure model, and a Cu-Zn alloy host with better lithiophilicity is prepared to confirm the superior comprehensive properties. Thus, the porous Cu-Zn alloy host with prestored Li (Cu-Zn\@Li) presents excellent cycling stability up to 1600 hours at the current density of 1 mA cm-2 for 1 mAh cm-2. In practical occasions, Cu-Zn\@Li\vert{}LFP full cell demonstrates excellent capacity retention with over 71\% after 850 cycles at 0.5 C. The phase-field simulation has been demonstrated to provide deep understanding and valuable guidance for design and preparation of high-performance 3D porous current collectors for Li metal anodes.},

However, traditional modeling methods are limited to a specific or reported SOEC system. Therefore, four machine learning models are developed to predict the performance of SOEC processes of various types, operating parameters, and feed conditions. The impact of these features on the SOEC's outputs is explained by the Shapley additive explanations and partial dependency plot analyses. The preferred model is integrated with a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal values of each input feature. Results show the improved extreme gradient enhanced regression (XGBoost) algorithm is the core of the machine learning model of the process since it has the highest R2 ({$>$} 0.95) in the three outputs. The electrolytic cell descriptors have a greater impact on the system performance, contributing up to 54.5\%. The effective area, voltage, and temperature are the three most influential factors in the SOEC system, contributing 21.6\%, 16.6\%, and 13.0\% to its performance. High temperature, high pressure, and low effective area are the most~favorable conditions for H2 production rate. After conducting multi-objective optimization, the optimal current intensity and hydrogen production rate were determined to be 1.61 A/cm2 and 1.174~L/(h\cdot{}cm2).},

  abstract      = {Fluidic oscillators are garnering increasing attention in various fields due to their self-induced oscillation characteristics. This study proposes a novel fluidic oscillator, the sweeping-vortex fluidic oscillator (SVFO), characterized by unique feedback properties. These properties exploit fluid feedback from the side opposite the attached wall and the spin delay of the captive vortex to yield low-frequency oscillating jets. The oscillation characteristics and the influence of main geometric parameters were investigated using computational fluid dynamics approach. Results show that the evolution of the flow field within the SVFO demonstrates an intricately dynamic interacting. The deflection switching of the main jet is primarily controlled by a pair of counter-rotating moving vortexes. Geometric parameters influence the stability of the dynamic evolution of both captive and moving vortexes, thereby altering the signal components of the output performance transmitted to the inlet. The overall width of the oscillator has a pronounced impact on the oscillation frequency, and with an increase in the overall width, a maximum frequency increase of 87 \% can be observed. Furthermore, the height of the sweeping chamber and the diameter of the vortex chamber outlet have a noticeable effect on the pressure pulse amplitude. A pressure fluctuation coefficient greater than 1.1 was recorded. The results also suggest that the geometric parameters of the fluidic oscillator need to be designed within a reasonable range; otherwise, the jet oscillator will not function. A more refined optimization of geometric parameters could be obtained with the aim of achieving a stable main jet, feedback flow of appropriate intensity, and optimal attachment conditions. This work reveals the oscillation mechanism and the influence of geometric parameters on SVFOs, providing a theoretical basis for designing related oscillators.},

The influence of the disturbance induced by the bubble formation could extend to certain distances, which decreased with the increase in the channel size. During regular flow stage, three mass transfer regimes were observed, which was shown to be dependent on the circulation patterns inside the liquid slug. The channel size significantly influences the occurrence of these regimes. From the analysis of the evolution characteristics, a simple map based the Fo number was proposed for the distinguish of these regimes. The values of the mass transfer coefficient are compared to two models derived from the penetration theory. The validity of the models and scope of application are discussed and proposed.},

  abstract      = {The simultaneous flow of gas, oil, and water forms various flow patterns due to the complex interfacial re\- lationships. Three-phase flow patterns are classified as the gas-liquid and liquid-liquid flow patterns. Pressure drop, void fraction, liquid holdup, and phase distribution are important characteristics of the three-phase flow. These characteristics are generally associated with the three-phase flow patterns. Hence, the knowledge about flow patterns can help to predict the overall behavior of the three-phase flow. Studies have been conducted to identify three-phase flow pattern and their characteristics at various superficial velocities of gas, oil, and water. The major purpose of the studies is to gather information about the three-phase co-current flow and use it for improvement of the efficiency of the flow systems. Therefore, the accuracy of the measurement technique is critical. Several types of flow pattern identification and measurement techniques have been developed to improve accuracy and provide high-quality results. In this article, classical and advanced techniques used for the three-phase flow identification and measurement have been reviewed. The survey will help the researchers working in the area of multiphase flow to choose the right technique based on the objectives of the studies.},

  abstract      = {We propose a simplified theory for the particles-turbulence interaction in a dilute two-phase flow with particles of arbitrary sizes. The theory takes into account two sources of turbulence in particle-laden flows: (i) the carrier fluid velocity gradients; and (ii) turbulent wakes behind the coarse particles. The theoretical description is based on the modified mixing-length theory and turbulent kinetic energy balance method. The solution ofthe problem for particle-laden flow does not require any additional quantitative empirical data; only the standard semi-empirical parameters for pure carrier fluid are used. The dimensional analysis of the system of equations is used to reduce to the minimum the number of nondimensional parameters in turbulent particle-laden flows. In the limits of fine and coarse particles the asymptotic expression for turbulence intensity is found. It is shown that in the former case the carrier fluid fluctuations intensity is found. It is shown that in the former case the carrier fluid fluctuations depend only on the value of the total mass content of the admixture; whereas in the latter one they are determined by the total mass content of the admixture, the density ratio of the phase and the aerodynamic properties of the particles. The proposed theory is applied to predict the fluctuations intensity in various types of turbulent particle-laden flows. The results of the calculations are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data.},

It was shown that aperiodic behavior of the 00s oscillations has no characteristic time scale. The power spectral distributions on the 00s oscillations in the fast fluidiied bed were found to be composed of three frequency regions, and their differences from those in the bubbling fluidized bed and in the transport were discussed. The fractal dimensions of the power spectra in the high frequency region were evaluated through the so-called llf-like distributions. The l\&like and l/B,,-like distributions obtained from the power spectral analyses were considered to be two important characteristics of the linkage between the 00s oscillations and variations of the local solids structure.},

In addition, the growingbody of data on gas-solid flows is analyzed in a self-consistent manner. Pita and Sundaresan [2] have recently shown that the model was able to reproduce one set of experimental data surprisingly well although the model neglects some important physics relevant to the problem; for example, only elastic particle--particle collisions were considered. In this study, attention is restricted to the same case, and it is found that, in general, the model predictions compare favorably with the experimental data. Predictions from a model which neglects particle-particle interactions are shown, as well as the effect of these interactions on the complex relationship between the operating variables.},

  abstract      = {In the field of fluid mechanics, traditional turbulence models such as those based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations play a crucial role in solving numerous problems. However, their accuracy in complex scenarios is often limited due to inherent assumptions and approximations, as well as imprecise coefficients in the turbulence model equations. Addressing these challenges, our research introduces an innovative approach employing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to optimize the parameters of the standard    k - \ensuremath{\omega} turbulence model. PINNs integrate physical loss functions into the model, enabling the adaptation of all coefficients in the standard    k - \ensuremath{\omega} model as trainable parameters. This novel methodology significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of turbulent flow simulations, as demonstrated by our application to the flow over periodic hills. The two coefficients that have been modified considerably are      \ensuremath{\sigma} \ensuremath{\omega} and \ensuremath{\alpha}, which correspond to the diffusion and production terms in the specific dissipation rate equation. The results indicate that the RANS simulation with PINNs coefficients (   k - \ensuremath{\omega} -PINNs simulation) improves the prediction of separation in the near-wall region and mitigates the overestimation of turbulent kinetic energy compared to the base RANS simulation. This research marks a significant advancement in turbulence modeling, showcasing the potential of PINNs in parameter identification and optimization in fluid mechanics.},

  abstract      = {We report on 3D computer simulations based on the soft-sphere discrete particle model (DPM) of Geldart A particles in a 3D gas-fluidized bed. The effects of particle and gas properties on the fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles are studied, with focus on the predictions of Umf and Umb, which are compared with the classical empirical correlations due to Abrahamsen and Geldart [1980. Powder Technology 26, 35–46]. It is found that the predicted minimum fluidization velocities are consistent with the correlation given by Abrahamsen and Geldart for all cases that we studied. The overshoot of the pressure drop near the minimum fluidization point is shown to be influenced by both particle–wall friction and the interparticle van der Waals forces. A qualitative agreement between the correlation and the simulation data for Umb has been found for different particle–wall friction coefficients, interparticle van der Waals forces, particle densities, particle sizes, and gas densities. For fine particles with a diameter dp {$<$} 40 m, a deviation has been found between the Umb from simulation and the correlation. This may be due to the fact that the interparticle van der Waals forces are not incorporated in the simulations, where it is expected that they play an important role in this size range. The simulation results obtained for different gas viscosities, however, display a different trend when compared with the correlation. We found that with an increasing gas shear viscosity the Umb experiences a minimum point near 2.0 \texttimes{} 10-5 Pa s, while in the correlation the minimum bubbling velocity decreases monotonously for increasing g. ᭧ 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {This study employs the VOF method to conduct the direct numerical simulation of the collapse progress of the near-wall bubble cluster. Factors such as viscosity, compressibility, and surface tension are taken into account, with an emphasis on the flow field energy evolution. Firstly, the collapse of a cubic bubble cluster comprising 64 bubbles is simulated, validating previous research regarding the morphological evolution and energy release mechanisms during cluster collapse. Overall, the cubic bubble cluster collapse exhibits a layer-by-layer phenomenon, where the outer layer bubbles collapse first, converting a portion of bubble potential energy into fluid kinetic energy, which then contributes to the inner layer bubble collapse. The pressure wave energy is primarily released when the whole bubble cluster completely collapses. Secondly, we investigate the collapse process of columnar bubble clusters, which closely resemble realistic cloud cavitation. By comparing the collapse behavior of bubble clusters with different heights, we reveal the non-linear delay effect of the cluster height on the collapse time. Additionally, we consolidate our long-term research on the bubble cluster and conclude that both the scale and shape of the bubble clusters have a limited impact on the conversion rate \ensuremath{\eta} of bubble potential energy to pressure wave energy \ensuremath{\eta}. For instance, when the stand-off distance \ensuremath{\eta}=1.5 and the inter-bubble distance D=2.5, the conversion rate \ensuremath{\eta} remains consistently 9–15\% for various bubble clusters of different scales and shapes.},

  abstract      = {Recently, there has been a steady increase in demand for lithium (Li) and its compounds, accounting for 10\% over the past decade. The level of production and industrial use of lithium currently serves as a development indicator of advanced countries' innovative potential. Although there are large-scale and high-quality lithium deposits in Russia (Kola and Irkutsk regions), Li production is manufacturing mostly from import stock. In modern Russian realities, roasting and hydrometallurgical processing of ores and concentrates using sulfuric acid and lime-soda methods seem to be practically uncontested. The present study provides a thorough review of technologies of Li production from such industrial sources, as spodumene, lepidolite, petalite, and mica. Major large-scale methods, used currently in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, are discussed and matched with the world's scientific achievements to shape a complex picture of the current technology level. The latest enhancements of the sulfation method significantly increase its overall technological efficiency: sulfuric acid treatment of spodumene is the most cost-effective for processing of lithium ores containing at least 1.0\% Li2O without preliminary enrichment. At the same time, the main advantages of the lime roasting method are versatility, the absence of scarce reagents, and the use of typical equipment. Roasting remains the only known industrial method that allows getting lithium hydroxide directly from raw material, without precipitation of intermediate compounds. However, the roasting scheme also has several disadvantages: the necessity of the use of concentrates with high lithium content; elevated energy consumption; operating complexity. The technology of autoclave leaching of Ukrainian petalite ores being discussed as well. Presumably, autoclave-based methods are optimal for poor raw material processing with high efficiency. In conclusion, technologies of Li-mica processing briefly considered, taking into account the issues of waste disposal and economic background. Altogether, the review summarizes the essential aspects of industrial technologies of lithium ores and concentrates processing, mainly used in Eastern Europe and Russia.},

Many commercial data analysis packages do not fully address the initial data cleaning and data conditioning tasks which can consume up to 80\% of the modelling time. The software toolkit has been developed specifically with the aim of focusing on the industrial needs for the initial data pre-screening of large industrial data sets. The core feature of Pre-Screen is that it has been specifically developed to make the analysis of large data sets as fast and visual as possible, and accessible for both process and control engineers, analytical scientists and academic R\&D without taking away the need for engineering science understanding. The toolbox builds on top of the MATLAB numerical computing environment, with powerful user interface procedures providing user friendly, mouse/menu driven software. The toolbox has been complied to allow use by those whom do not have access to MATLAB.},

This paper reviews some recent studies of emulsions in turbulent Taylor–Couette flow, mainly focusing on the statistics of the dispersed phase and the global momentum transport of the system. We first study the size distribution and the breakup mechanism of the dispersed droplets for turbulent emulsions with a low volume-fraction (dilute) of the dispersed phase. For systems with a high volume-fraction (dense) of the dispersed phase, we address the detailed response of the global transport (effective viscosity) of the turbulent emulsion and its connection to the droplet statistics. Finally, we will discuss catastrophic phase inversions, which can happen when the volume-fraction of the dispersed phase exceeds a critical value during dynamic emulsification. We end the manuscript with a summary and an outlook including some open questions for future research.

In addition, in order to improve the quality of the electrical energy injected into the grid and to prevent possible electrical faults, the total harmonic distortion (THD) in the grid current should be controlled in accordance with IEEE-519 standards. In other respects, uncontrolled injected energy may causes losses, excessive electrical energy demand and overloading. In this study, an artificial neural network based active and reactive power control method is proposed for grid-connected single-phase Proton Exchange Membrane Hydrogen Fuel Cell (PEMFC). The aim of the proposed control structure is to have low harmonic distortion, high power factor performance as well as an easy and understandable structure. The proposed method was applied to a 6~kW prototype. Five different scenarios and nine different activation function were tried to verify the performance of the proposed control method. As a result of these processes, the power factor was measured as unity ({$>$}0.99) and the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid current, under all operation states, is {\$<\$}2\%. In addition, it has been observed that the success rate of artificial neural networks is {\$>\$}97\%.},

The distributions of gas temperature and concentrations of gas species were obtained using a simple two-dimensional model with Rh/Al2O3 catalyst particles. Numerical results show that the reforming reaction rate on catalyst particles in the cluster is much smaller than the rate on isolated catalyst particle in the stream. The molar ratio of H2/CO is increased due to catalyst particle clustering. The effects of gas temperature, inlet gas velocity and reactor pressure on reforming reactions are also investigated.},

To reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the cavitation bubble near a rigid boundary with a gas-entrapping hole, a fully compressible three-phase model, accounting for the three-phase volume transport equation, was implemented in OpenFOAM. The predicted bubble shape was validated with the corresponding experimental photos, and good agreement was achieved. The bubble's primary physical features (e.g., the expanding shock wave, upward and downward liquid jet, and high-pressure region) are well reproduced, which helps understand the underlying mechanisms. The numerical results show that the solid wall with a gas-entrapping hole could affect the morphology of both the bubble and liquid jet, as well as shortens the bubble's first oscillation period in comparison to an intact rigid wall. The relationship among the prolongation factor, the standoff distance, and the relative size ratio is analyzed. It is found the prolongation factor increases as the relative size ratio decrease. As the standoff distance decreases, the gas entrapping hole plays a significant role in the oscillation period of the bubble. The current model can be further extended to reveal the microscopic mechanism of aeration avoiding cavitation damage and investigate the interaction between air bubbles and cavitation bubbles, which is of great interest to practical applications.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, deep learning has become ubiquitous and is empowering various fields. In particular, the combination of artificial intelligence and traditional science (AI for science, AI4Science) has attracted widespread attention. In the field of AI4Science, the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to solve partial differential equations (AI4PDEs) has become the focus of computational mechanics research. The core of AI4PDEs is to fuse data with equations and can solve almost any PDEs. Due to the advantages of AI4PDEs in data fusion, computational efficiency using AI4PDEs is usually increased by tens of thousands of times compared to traditional algorithms. Therefore, this article comprehensively reviews the research on AI4PDEs, summarizes the existing AI4PDEs algorithms and theories, discusses its application in solid mechanics, including forward and inverse problems, and outlines future research directions, especially the foundation model of computational mechanics. Existing algorithms of AI4PDEs include physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep energy methods (DEM), operator learning, and (physics-informed neural operator, PINO). AI4PDEs has numerous applications in scientific computing, and this paper focuses on application of AI4PDEs in the forward and inverse problems of solid mechanics. The forward problems include linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, hyperelasticity, and fracture mechanics; while the inverse problems encompass the identification of material parameters, constitutive laws, defect recognition, and topology optimization. AI4PDEs represents a novel method of scientific simulation, which offers approximate solutions for specific problems by leveraging large datasets and then fine-tunes according to the specific physical equations, avoiding the need to start calculations from scratch as traditional algorithms do. Thus, AI4PDEs is a prototype for the foundation model of computational mechanics in the future, capable of significantly accelerating traditional numerical methods. We believe that utilizing artificial intelligence to empower scientific computing is not only a vital direction for the future of computation but also a dawn of humanity in scientific research, laying the foundation for mankind to reach new heights in scientific development.},

  abstract      = {The Venturi reactor, widely used in process intensification through hydrodynamic cavitation technology, has proven highly effective in various chemical and environmental applications. The cavitation intensity of a Venturi is primarily influenced by shape parameters such as the convergent angle (\ensuremath{\beta}1), throat diameter (dth), throat length (lth), and divergent angle (\ensuremath{\beta}2). However, the impact of these parameters on cavitation intensity has not been sufficiently clarified. In this study, the structural optimization of a Venturi reactor was accomplished by integrating deep neural networks with particle swarm optimization. The Cavitation Intensity Prediction Network model, which combines artificial neural networks and numerical simulation, was used to establish the nonlinear relationship between shape parameters and cavitation intensity. Partial dependence plots and individual conditional expectation plots were utilized to clarify the influence of each parameter. The findings reveal that the cavitation intensity of the optimal Venturi is 2.76 times greater than that of the original design. Reducing \ensuremath{\beta}1 resulted in a swift conversion of static pressure into dynamic pressure, but it also caused an uneven distribution of fluid velocity. To reduce this unevenness and allow the dynamic pressure in the throat to reach its peak, which is advantageous for cavitation generation, lth should be extended. dth directly influenced the efficiency of converting static pressure into dynamic pressure and was a key factor in determining cavitation intensity. \ensuremath{\beta}2 indirectly impacted cavitation intensity by modulating the space available for cavitation development. The insights gained from this study may provide valuable guidance for designing Venturis in process intensification applications.},

The current work utilizes the volume of fluid method in conjunction with discrete element method (VOF-DEM) to study particle entrainment in gas–liquid-solid three-phase reactors featuring different gas inlet layouts. Following model validation, this study delves into the multiphase flow characteristics and particle behaviors in detail. The results reveal that the merging of adjacent channels leads to the formation of larger combined bubbles, thereby increasing particle force, velocity and entrainment height. The average entrainment height during the merging of adjacent bubble channels is 42\% higher compared to the four-channel configuration. However, this amalgamation diminishes the channel count and particle entrainment count. Specifically, the highest particle entrainment occurs in the two-channel configuration, which is 26\% greater than that in the adjacent-channel merging configuration. Conversely, increasing the channel number decreases bubble size and overall particle entrainment capacity. With consistent bubble sizes, an increase in particle entrainment is associated with reduced entrainment height, indicative of diminished momentum transfer from bubble wakes to individual particles. Additionally, maintaining an optimal number of channels ensures high gas inlet velocity and bubble size, thereby enhancing particle entrainment efficiency. Lastly, appropriately reducing channel distance fosters interaction between adjacent channels, resulting in a meandering bubble path that further promotes particle entrainment and elution efficiency. The results obtained from this study serve as a useful reference for the design and optimization of similar systems.},

  abstract      = {In the production of Chinese aluminum industry, the accumulation and storage of many waste aluminum electrolytes containing lithium causes severe environmental pollution and is also a waste of lithium resources. Therefore, extracting lithium from waste aluminum electrolytes can supplement the market's demand for lithium resources and achieve the regeneration and utilization of solid waste resources. This article proposes a method for ultrasonic-assisted organic acid leaching of lithium-containing waste aluminum electrolytes and lithium recovery. It was found that organic acid malonic acid could selectively leach lithium from waste lithium containing aluminum electrolyte. Under the conditions of ultrasound power of 400~W, the malonic acid concentration of 2~mol/L, the liquid-solid ratio of 25:1, leaching temperature of 80~\textdegree{}C, and a leaching time of 2~h, the leaching rate of Li reaches 92.37\%, which is 4\% higher than conventional leaching. Ultrasound is used to optimize the leaching conditions and save production costs. Neutralize the leaching solution to obtain the Na3AlF6 by-product, which can be returned to the aluminum electrolysis cell for further use. Finally, high-purity lithium carbonate products were obtained through precipitation, forming a new technology for clean and efficient lithium recovery from waste aluminum electrolytes.},

  abstract      = {A bubbling fluidized bed reactor is designed to investigate the high-temperature calcination and decomposition characteristics of phosphogypsum (PG). The reactor employs electric heating, and a lifting discharge tube is installed in the middle of the air distributor to allow flexible switching between batch and continuous feeding modes. The batch test results show that the solid-phase bed materials with a PG particle size of 0.27–0.55 mm and a coal particle size of 0.55–0.83 mm are found to have uniformly mixed at a PG/coal mass ratio of 5:1 and calcined at a high temperature of 1100 \textdegree{}C for 30 min. PG completely decomposes to yield mainly CaS and a small amount of Ca2(SiO4) as the solid-phase products. For the above-mentioned optimal process parameters, a 120 min thermal-state continuous test is conducted. Feeding and discharging are performed at intervals of 30 min to maintain the stability of the static bed height inside the reactor. The results indicate that the PG decomposition rate is higher than 92\% in the batch and continuous tests. However, the continuous decomposition of PG has significant process advantages, such as a higher CaS yield (71.20\%) compared to that in the batch mode (64.49\%). Furthermore, PG undergoes agglomeration and bonding within the particles when heated, intensifying the formation of a Ca2(SiO4) eutectic.},

  abstract      = {Having passed the primitive phases and starting to revolutionize many different fields in some way, artificial intelligence is on its way to becoming a disruptive technology. It is also foreseen to totally change human-centred traditional engineering design approaches. Although still in the early phases, AI-powered engineering applications enable them to work with ambiguous design parameters and solve complex engineering problems, not otherwise possible with traditional design methods. This work attempts to shine a light on current progress and future research trends in AI applications in design/engineering design concepts, covering the last 15 years which is the ramp-up period for AI. Methods such as machine learning, genetic algorithm, and fuzzy logic have been carefully examined from an engineering design perspective. AI-powered design studies have been categorized and critically reviewed for various design stages such as inspiration, idea and concept generation, evaluation, optimization, decision-making, and modelling. As an overview result of this review, we can confidently say that the interest in data-based design methods and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has increased in recent years. Furthermore, the use of AI methods in engineering design applications helps to obtain efficient, fast, accurate, and comprehensive results. Especially with deep learning methods and combinations, situations where human capacity is insufficient can be addressed efficiently. However, choosing the right AI method for a design problem under consideration is significantly important for such successful results. Hence, we have given an outline perspective on choosing the right AI method based on the literature outcomes for design problems.},

This study investigates hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) as an efficient method for dispersing cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) produced via enzymatic hydrolysis, comparing its performance with the conventional ultrasonication (US) method. HC successfully dispersed CNCs at a concentration of 0.2 \% w/v in just 10 min, maintaining excellent colloidal stability after several days with minimal changes in particle size and transparency. In contrast, CNCs dispersed using US exhibited significant agglomeration and loss of colloidal stability. Additionally, CNCs dispersed via HC demonstrated strong potential as a gelling agent, as evidenceed by their use in formulating of a transparent gel-based hand sanitizer, positioning them as efficient alternative to commercial gels. Importantly, HC achieved up to ten times greater energy efficiency than US, with substantially lower energy dissipation per kilogram of CNC. This improved efficiency highlights HC advantages for large-scale industrial applications, offering sustainable and cost-effective solutions for nanomaterial production.},

In the first step of the study, kinetic model of the existing reactions was obtained using artificial neural network (ANN) approach. In order to build the ANN model industrial data of a typical EO reactor were employed. Time, C2H4, C2H4O, CO2, H2O and O2 mole fractions were network inputs and the multiplication of reaction rate and catalyst deactivation (r\textasteriskcentereda)was ANN output. From 164 data, 109 data were employed to train ANN. After employing different training algorithms, it was found that, the radial basis function network (RBFN) training algorithm provides the best estimations of the data. This best obtained network was tested against fifty five unseen data. The network estimations were close to unseen data which confirmed generalization capability of the obtained network. In the next step of study, (r\textasteriskcentereda) was estimated with ANN and then the hybrid model of the reactor was solved. Simulation results were compared with EO mechanistic model and also with plant industrial data. It was found that GBM is 8.437 times more accurate than the mechanistic model.},

Calculations at the industrial reactor scale show that a promising way to improve reproducibility and uniformity of NC deposition at short term could be to increase deposition time by highly diluting silane in a carrier gas. This dilution leads to a decrease of silane deposition rate and to a marked increase of the contribution to deposition of unsaturated species such as silylene SiH2. This result gives importance to our DFT calculations since they reveal that only silylene (and probably other unsaturated species) are involved in the very first steps of nucleation i.e. silicon chemisorption on silanol Si–OH or siloxane Si–O–Si bonds present on SiO2 substrates. Saturated molecules such as silane could only contribute to NC growth, i.e. chemisorption on already deposited silicon bonds, since their decomposition activation barriers on SiO2 surface are as high as 3 eV.},

Despite their potential, the effectiveness of their direct photochemical conversion into the resulting quadricyclanes has room for improvement owing to (i) moderate quantum yields, (ii) poor overlap with the solar spectrum and (iii) photochemical back reactions. Herein, we present an approach to enhance the performance of such molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems through the triplet-sensitized conversion of aryl-substituted norbornadienes. Our study combines deep spectroscopic analyses, irradiation experiments, and quantum mechanical calculations to elucidate the energy transfer mechanism and inherent advantages of the resulting MOST systems. We demonstrate remarkable quantum yields using readily available sensitizers under both LED and solar light irradiation, significantly surpassing those achieved through direct excitation with photons of higher energy. In contrast to the conventional approach, light-induced back reactions of the high-energy products do not play any role, allowing quantitative switching within minutes. These results not only underscore the potential of triplet-sensitized MOST systems to leverage the high energy storage capabilities of multistate photoswitches but they might also stimulate the broader usage of sensitization strategies in photochemical energy conversion.},

In the present study, a CFD model in ANSYS FLUENT is developed for better understanding the transport phenomena, especially the phase change, in a quite complex plate-fin heat exchanger operated in a gas refining company. The flow channels, ducts and passes of the cold box, are considered in the computational geometry. The porous media technique is introduced in the computational domain due to the excessive increase in the number of computational grids when the fins accounted for in the numerical domain. The flash calculations (FC) technique is coupled with CFD in evaluation of chemical species in the cold box by a user defined function. This study examines the importance of local thermal equilibrium between the porous medium and fluid flow without mass transfer (LTE-non mass), local thermal equilibrium between the porous medium and fluid flow with mass transfer (LTE), and local thermal non equilibrium between the porous medium and fluid flow with mass transfer (LTNE) in simulation of an industrial cold box. Numerical results are compared with the corresponding operational data and the best agreement is obtained by the LTNE approach. The calculated mean relative errors of the LTNE approach for the outlet vapor fraction of streams A, hot stream, B and C, sided cold streams, are 0.15, 0.352, and 0.173\%, respectively.},

Li extraction by membranes is reviewed in the literature much more than electrochemical processes. However, a very recent review thoroughly discussed Li recovery by electrochemically switchable ion exchange (ESIX). This paper reviews Li recovery by both charge transfer processes, namely electrodialysis (ED), and electro-sorption processes, namely capacitive deionization (CDI). It also reviews ESIX with a focus on performance matrices and includes comments on the technology readiness of each separation technique. These processes exhibit promising perspectives on the separation and recovery of Li both selectively and non-selectively from simulated brine solutions and Li salt solutions. Readers are provided with guidelines to choose between the processes, depending on the applied voltage, current density, specific energy consumption and purity of recovered Li. Most electrochemical lithium capturing systems (ELiCSs) have been tested at the lab scale. Therefore, future research should be directed toward pilot-scale development and parameter optimization. Furthermore, we urge the ELiCSs research community to report information in a standard form that allows meaningful comparisons and insights into the systems.},

The limitations of turbulent mixing are illustrated by the example of the heterogeneous NO/CO/char reaction, relevant in CFB combustion of nitrogen-containing solid fuels. The mass transfer of the gaseous reactants to the char surface is determined, and how the conversion is influenced by the degree of mixing of the multiphase system by turbulent dispersion. Particle/turbulence interactions are taken into account by a (Lagrangian) frequency spectrum of velocity fluctuations, which determine the dispersion of the char particles described here with the Tchen–Hinze model. Chars from solid fuels characterised by fuel ratio (FR) ranging from 0.1 (wood) via 0.5 (peat) and 1 (coal A) to 2 (coal B) were considered. The effective rate of the NO/CO/char reaction is determined as a function of the size and type of the char particle, temperature, particle concentration, reactor dimensions and fluidisation velocity, at atmospheric pressure.},

This investigation provided a great deal of critical information for use in future process development. Before solvent extraction, the FCC slurry is extremely complex. Saturates content is relatively high, and there are a variety of aromatic ring substituents. In addition, molecular uniformity is poor and chemical steric hindrance is strong. On the contrary, the composition of a fraction enriched in aromatics is relatively simple with excellent uniformity and homogeneous molecular alkyl-substituents. The aromatic enriched fraction (FCCRF) from the FCC slurry has weak chemical steric hindrance and, consequently, is more reactive than the original FCC slurry.},

Fluidized cracking catalyst (FCC) particles with volume average size of 70/xm and density of 1650 kg/m3, in a dilute gas--solid flow system with solid volume fraction ranging from 0.2\% to 2.5\% and solid mass flux of 10-120 kg/m2 s were experimentally studied at the test section which was 1.07 meters away from the entrance zone. More particle collision and less slip velocity between particles of different size were observed at higher solids loadings and superficial gas velocities. At lower superficial gas velocities and lower solids loadings, instantaneous reversal flow of particles and lower particles fluctuating velocities and larger particles/aggiomerates were measured along the wall. The radial distribution of axial particles velocity profile was flatter than a parabolic shape with maximum velocity of particles of different size in most cases away from the center. The particles fluctuating velocities was about 20\%--30\% of the particle velocity. However, it decreased at the wall region due to less probability of collision with moving particles and significant collision with the wall. In contrast, the turbulence intensity increased at the wall region due to lower particles velocities in this zone.},

An iteration procedure was utilized to modify the initial calibration curves, which was verified both theoretically and practically. Calibrations using two different batches of FCC particles, with different carbon contents, indicate that these probes are sensitive to minor variations of particle colour and reflective properties; however, the characteristic shape of the calibration curves remains unchanged and a simple linear relationship exists between the curves from different batches of FCC particles. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

  abstract      = {Mesoscale structures (bubbles, clusters and streamers) in two-phase flows, especially in gas–solid fluidized beds significantly affect macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior. For industrial-scale fluidized beds, it is typically impractical to simulate these structures directly due to the excessive resolution required. To model effects of mesoscale structures, the ensemble phase averaging method is extended to derive macroscopic averaged equations and their closures. It is found that added-mass and drag reduction effects due to mesoscale structures play essential roles in the macroscopic equations of motion. Unlike the classical added-mass force, which is proportional to the continuous fluid density, the mesoscale added-mass force is proportional to the mixture density. Thus for gas–solid systems wherein the classical added-mass force is almost always negligible, the mesoscale added-mass force is, in contrast, found to be quite important. Mesoscale drag reduction results from the fact that, in a particle rich region, there is significantly less relative velocity between particle and fluid phases than indicated by the macroscopic relative velocity.},

The probability density distributions (PDD) of transient solid fraction and particle velocity show bimodal distributions in the riser, while in the downer, the PDD curves only exhibit single peak distribution. The results indicate that two-phase solid flow structure exists in the riser: i.e. a dense cluster phase and a dispersed particle phase. Although there are solid aggregations in the downer, the solid concentration of which is much lower than that in the riser, and they could not form a dense cluster phase with solid fraction 1 \`{A} emf as those in the riser. From the analysis and comparison of transient solid fraction signal and the PDD of solid fraction and particle velocity in the riser and downer, it is clear that significant difference exist in the solid flow structure and the particle cluster mechanism between the gravity-assisted gas – solid flow in the downer and the against-gravity flow in the riser.},

  abstract      = {Heterogeneous structures of a particle–fluid system at constant fluid flow velocity and constant pressure drop are simulated by the socalled pseudo-particle modeling (PPM). The mass specific energy consumption Nst for suspending and transporting the solids is obtained by a weighted average method simultaneously. The stability criterion, Nst =min, proposed in the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is demonstrated numerically, which reflects the spatial and temporal compromise of the movement tendencies of the fluid and solid phases, and leads to the formation of heterogeneous structures. Further work shows that when the total mass specific energy consumption for the solids (NT ) is variable, Nst /NT = min should be used as a more general expression of the original stability criterion. Analysis of simulation results also shows dilute-to-dense phase drag responsible for the difference between Nst and NT .},

  abstract      = {Many computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models for describing the hydrodynamics of dense gas-solid flows in fluidized beds have been put forward in the past few decades. These models treat the solid phase as continuum or discrete particles, which leads to Eulerian-Eulerian or Eulerian-Lagrangian formulations, respectively. Different governing equations and closure relations essentially result from an insufficient understanding of the complex gas-particle and particle-particle interactions for gas-solid flows. The current status of these models is discussed briefly in this paper. All the approaches in the literature modify only the solid phase momentum balance equcation introducing various forms of the solid phase stress tensor and the solid phase pressure drop in the Eulerian-Eulerian models. Taking them into consideration, a new model for predicting the fluid behavior of dense gas-solid flows in fluidized beds has been developed, which contains new terms in both the particle and gas phase momentum balance equations and requires only the use of an experimental drag force correlation. Several results are shown to verify the model's reliability, which include the homogeneous fluidization of Geldart type A particles, the bubbling and jetting fluidization of Geldart type B particles in rectangular beds, and fluid dynamics in a complicated geometry for a bubbling-bed of a fast internally circulating fluidized-bed biomass gasifier.},

The experimental results suggest that both solids circulation rates and superficial gas velocities had a significant influence on the local heat transfer to the ceiling close to the riser exit to the gas solids separator.

Three types of mixtures are considered, in which biomass is a thin long stalk, and sand belongs to the Geldart B category. Experiments are carried out in a segmented fluidized bed equipped with multiple pressure transducers. Three initial packing conditions and two experiment procedures are used. The fluidization velocity varies to cover a wide range. Results show that in the local fluidization region, the mixing and segregation patterns are sensitive to the initial packing condition. In the case of a fully segregated state with biomass at the bottom, the bed inversion can be significantly observed due to the great segregation tendency of biomass. Further analyses indicate that the mixing ratio exerts a subtle influence on the competition between mixing and segregation by disturbing the coalescence and break-up of the bubble. In addition, the pressure fluctuation signal proves to be helpful in understanding the dynamic features of the phenomenology.},

It is shown that the existence of particle clusters, unique to the solid flow behavior in such a reactor, can be predicted from this first principle approach. The results demonstrate that there are two types of clusters in a riser and downer: one is in the near wall region where the velocities of particles are low; the other is in the center region where the velocities of particles are high. While the extent of particle aggregation appears to be similar, the duration time for the first type in a downer is shorter than in a riser. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the formation of clusters is affected by a range of variables related to operational conditions, particle properties, and bed properties and geometry. The increase of solid volume fraction, sliding and rolling friction between particles or between particles and wall, or damping coefficient can enhance the formation of clusters. The use of multi-sized particles can also promote the formation of clusters. But the increase of gas velocity or use of a wider bed can suppress the formation of clusters. The van der Waals force may enhance the formation of clusters when solid concentration is high but suppress the formation of clusters near the wall region when solid concentration is low. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To improve the catalytic activity and coking resistance of SRM catalysts, great efforts (including the addition of promoters, development of advanced supports, and structural modification, etc.) have been made with considerable progress in the past decade. Meanwhile, a series of novel processes have been explored for more efficient and energy-saving SRM. In this scenario, a comprehensive review on the recent advances in SRM is necessary to provide a constructive insight into the development of SRM technology, however, is still lacking. Herein, the improvements in catalyst construction for conventional SRM and the newly developed SRM processes in the past decade are presented and analyzed. First, the critical issues of SRM catalysts are briefly introduced. Then, the recent research advances of the most popular Ni based catalysts and the catalysts based on the other non-noble metals (Co, Cu, Mo etc.) and the efficient but costly noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru etc.) are discussed. Furthermore, the development of the representative modified SRM processes, including thermo-photo hybrid SRM, sorbent enhanced SRM, oxidative SRM, chemical looping SRM, plasma and electrical-field enhanced SRM, is demonstrated, and their advantages and limits are compared. Finally, a critical perspective is provided to enlighten future work on this significant area.},

Understanding the evolution of oil droplets could reveal the interfacial and colloidal interactions, facilitate the design of advanced membranes, and improve the separation performances. This review on the characteristic behavior and evolution of oil droplets focuses on the advanced analytical techniques, and the subsequent fouling as well as demulsification effects during membrane separation. A detailed introduction is provided on microscopic observations and numerical simulations of the dynamic evolution of oil droplets, featuring real-time in-situ visualization and accurate reconstruction, respectively. Characteristic behaviors of these oil droplets include attachment, pinning, wetting, spreading, blockage, intrusion, coalescence, and detachment, which have been quantified by specific proposed parameters and criteria. The fouling process can be evaluated using Hermia and resistance models. The related adhesion force and intrusion pressure as well as droplet–droplet/membrane interfacial interactions can be accurately quantified using various force analysis methods and advanced force measurement techniques. It is encouraging to note that oil coalescence has been achieved through various effects such as electrostatic interactions, mechanical actions, Laplace pressure/surface free energy gradients, and synergistic effects on functional membranes. When oil droplets become destabilized and coalesce into larger ones, the functional membranes can overcome the limitations of size-sieving effect to attain higher separation efficiency. This not only bypasses the trade-off between permeability and rejection, but also significantly reduces membrane fouling. Finally, the challenges and potential research directions in membrane separation are proposed. We hope this review will support the engineering of advanced materials for oil/water separation and research on interface science in general.},

  abstract      = {The lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is a powerful tool for simulating incompressible viscous flow, offering several advantages over traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Instead of solving Navier–Stokes equations, the LBM uses a discrete mesoscopic approach that represents fluid as discrete parcels moving in a fixed lattice, subject to simple collision rules. As a result, an LBM solver is simpler and more computationally efficient than a traditional CFD solver. The LBM-DEM coupling method can naturally represent fluid flow in the pores formed by large particles and can accommodate multiphase flow, making it particularly useful for modeling complex fluid-solid interactions. This chapter presents a direct derivation of the lattice Boltzmann equation from the continuous Boltzmann equation, discretized in a special manner in both time and phase space. In addition, this chapter also presents a formulation of the DEM/LBM coupling method, along with a modeling of particle-fluid interaction. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the coupling method: pore-scale fluid flow through idealized porous media and modeling of multi-phase fluid in porous rocks.},

  abstract      = {Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) can play important roles in integrated energy systems (IES) as the hydrogen production hub and the resilience energy hub. When tied to a microgrid with high renewable penetration, the SOEC is subjected to rapid load transitions in response to the intermittent renewable generations that occur not only in diurnal cycles but also in short timeframes (e.g., sub-minute). The cyber-physical simulation approach can derisk operability research but requires a real-time dynamic SOEC model. In the present work, a real-time multiphysics model for pressurized SOEC is developed and validated in the pressure range from 1.4 to 8~bar. The accuracy of the single repeating unit (SRU) assumption in SOEC stack simulation is quantified. A guidance of more than 45 cells in one SOEC stack is recommended to safely apply the SRU assumption. Modeling results suggest that at a given current density, more power is consumed by SOEC at elevated operating pressures. The anode air and cathode stream have major impacts on thermal management, highlighting the potential benefit of integrating SOEC with other thermal processes in IES. To achieve high hydrogen production efficiency, the SOEC could operate at the maximum endothermic point to maximize the use of thermal energy. The real-time execution of the developed SOEC model is also demonstrated, which only takes 0.1~\% of the fixed time step of 5~ms. The developed model establishes the basis for cyber-physical simulation of SOEC hybrid systems.},

The proposed scheme combines the advantages of the fluid-solid interaction scheme and geometric scheme--easy to implement (no need to interpolate the values of parameters exactly on solid boundaries and find proper characteristic vectors), the value of contact angle can be directly prescribed, and no unphysical spurious mass layer--and avoids mass leakage. Different from previous works, the values of the order parameter gradient on fluid boundary nodes are directly determined according to the geometric formulation rather than indirectly regulated through the order parameters on ghost solid nodes (i.e., ghost contact-line region). For this purpose, two numerical approaches to evaluate the order parameter gradient on fluid boundary nodes are utilized, one with the prevalent isotropic central scheme and the other with a local gradient scheme that utilizes the distribution functions. The simplified wetting boundary schemes with both numerical approaches are validated and compared through several numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed model has good ability and satisfactory accuracy to simulate wetting phenomena on curved boundaries under large density ratios.},

With the increasing demand for dietary health and food standardization, the staple food of flour products made from coarse grains due to its unique flavor and rich nutrition has become a trend and is favored by consumers. However, the lack of gluten protein in the raw materials prevented the formation of a stable gluten network structure, leading to the deterioration of the quality of flour products. Ultrasonic treatment, as an innovative food processing technology, generated energy during the action of ultrasonic waves that had a positive impact on the texture, organizational structure, or flavor characteristics of food. That was of great significance for improving food production efficiency, improving food processing quality, and extending food shelf life. This article applied ultrasonic technology to the processing of flour products from the perspective of promoting fermentation and improving production efficiency of flour products. The cavitation effect of ultrasound promoted the formation of gluten network structure, improved the rheology properties of dough and the quality of flour products by promoting protein cross-linking, improving the foaming and emulsifying stability of gluten protein, and promoting the growth and reproduction of yeast. All reviewed studies indicate that ultrasound would be a promising technology for producing high-quality surface products under appropriate conditions.

However, solving nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with PINNs presents challenges due to inherent discontinuities in the solutions. This is particularly true for the Buckley–Leverett (B-L) equation, a key model for multiphase fluid flow in porous media. In this paper, we demonstrate that PINNs, in conjunction with Welge's construction, can achieve superior precision in handling the B-L equations in different scenarios including one shock and one rarefaction wave, two shocks connected by a rarefaction wave traveling in the same direction, and two shocks connected by a rarefaction wave traveling in opposite directions. Our approach accounts for variations in fluid mobility, fluid solubility, and gravity effects, with applications in modeling 1D water flooding, polymer flooding, gravitational flow, and CO2 injection into saline aquifers. Additionally, we applied PINNs to inverse problems to estimate multiple PDE parameters from observed data, demonstrating robustness under conditions of slight scarcity and up to 5\% impurity of labeled data as well as shortages in collocation data.},

  abstract      = {The frosting phenomenon poses a potential threat to both industrial production and daily life. Typically, a frost layer consists of frost crystals that grow on various micro-sized frozen droplets, and its development is significantly affected by the frost crystal behaviors. To better understand the frosting mechanism, a series of experiments are conducted to investigate the growth characteristics of frost crystals on single frozen droplets with sizes from 1.83 to 0.02 \ensuremath{\mu}L. The results show that the whole growth process of frost crystals on a frozen droplet can be categorized into three stages: crystal rapid growth, crystal growth and collapse, and crystal growth fully stages. As the droplet size decreases, the durations of the crystal rapid growth stage and the crystal growth and collapse stage exhibit an upward fluctuation. The maximum height of frost crystals increases with droplet size, while the net crystal height does not follow this trend. Specifically, the maximum net crystal heights on frozen droplets of 1.83, 0.97, 0.43, 0.05, and 0.02 \ensuremath{\mu}L at 1,800 s are 1.681, 1.386, 1.476, 1.134 and 1.355 mm, respectively. The growth rate of the highest crystal in the case of 1.83 \ensuremath{\mu}L shows a downward trend over time due to the consistently increased crystal surface temperature. Conversely, the growth rates in the cases of 0.97, 0.43, 0.05, and 0.02 \ensuremath{\mu}L initially increase and then decrease over time due to the combined effect of crystal surface temperature and water vapor competition. Both the total number of crystal collapses and the number per unit arc length increase with an increase in droplet size. The study contributes to developing accurate frost prediction models and offers insights for optimizing the defrosting control strategy of air source heat pumps or refrigerators.},

Specifically, contact angle hysteresis is incorporated into the model. Based on the modified model, this study investigates the impact of liquid water in channel under various operational conditions and channel design schemes. The results demonstrate that the existence of liquid water in straight channel increases the liquid water saturation in gas diffusion layer while reducing the optimal inlet humidity and operating temperature. When relative humidity (RH) is around 0.5, the difference in the prediction results of the performannce of PEMFC is greatest when considering whether liquid water in channel is present or not.

The former approach runs into practical difficulties, as the system must conform to the working distance and other restrictions of the imaging optics. The latter approach requires an inverse map from the speckle autocorrelation to the particle sizes. The principle relies on the pupil function determining the basic sidelobe shape, whereas the particle size spread modulates the sidelobe intensity. We recently showed that it is feasible to invert the speckle autocorrelation and obtain the PSD using a neural network, trained efficiently through a physics-informed semi-generative approach. In this work, we eliminate one of the most time-consuming steps of our previous method by engineering the pupil function. By judiciously blocking portions of the pupil, we sacrifice some photons but in return we achieve much enhanced sidelobes and, hence, higher sensitivity to the change of the size distribution. The result is a 60\,\texttimes{} reduction in total acquisition and processing time, or 0.25\,seconds per frame in our implementation. Almost real-time operation in our system is not only more appealing toward rapid industrial adoption, it also paves the way for quantitative characterization of complex spatial or temporal dynamics in drying, blending, and other chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.},

The morphological development of a laser-induced bubble as well as the production of jets are captured by utilizing high-speed photography. The principles of bubble morphology evolution and jet formation are revealed by a OpenFOAM solver, which takes into account the effects of two-phase fluid compressibility, phase changes, heat transfer, and surface tension. Fluid temperature variations induced by bubble oscillations are discussed. The results indicate that the jet dynamics can be categorized into three cases, i.e. bubble-splitting double jets, impacting single jet, non-impacting double jets. For bubble-splitting double jets, bubble splitting is induced by an annular pressure gradient towards the bubble axis. This resulted in the production of two unequal-sized sub-bubbles, which subsequently produced double jets in opposite directions. The fluid temperature close to the bubble interface is low, while the bubble center is high. For impacting single jet, it is induced by a conical pressure gradient towards the nearest particle and the jet impacts the particle. The fluid temperature is low near the jet and high near the particle. When the jet penetrates the bubble interface, the temperature inside the bubble reaches its peak. For non-impacting double jets, they are induced by pressure gradients facing each other and they do not impact particles. The temperature inside the bubble increases with the proximity of the two jets.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a novel CFD-driven machine learning framework to develop Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. The CFD-driven training is an extension of the gene expression programming method Weatheritt and Sandberg (2016) [8], but crucially the fitness of candidate models is now evaluated by running RANS calculations in an integrated way, rather than using an algebraic function. Unlike other data-driven methods that fit the Reynolds stresses of trained models to high-fidelity data, the cost function for the CFD-driven training can be defined based on any flow feature from the CFD results. This extends the applicability of the method especially when the training data is limited. Furthermore, the resulting model, which is the one providing the most accurate CFD results at the end of the training, inherently shows good performance in RANS calculations. To demonstrate the potential of this new method, the CFD-driven machine learning approach is applied to model development for wake mixing in turbomachines. A new model is trained based on a high-pressure turbine case and then tested for three additional cases, all representative of modern turbine nozzles. Despite the geometric configurations and operating conditions being different among the cases, the predicted wake mixing profiles are significantly improved in all of these a posteriori tests. Moreover, the model equation is explicitly given and available for analysis, thus it could be deduced that the enhanced wake prediction is predominantly due to the extra diffusion introduced by the CFD-driven model.},

  abstract      = {Granular matter is ubiquitous in nature and is present in diverse forms in important engineering, industrial and natural processes. Particle-based computational modelling has become indispensable to understand and predict the complex behaviour of granular matter in these processes. The success of modern computational models requires realistic and efficient consideration of particle shape. Realistic particle shapes in naturally occurring and engineered materials offer diverse challenges owing to their multiscale nature in both length and time. Furthermore, the complex interactions with other materials, such as interstitial fluids, are highly nonlinear and commonly involve multiphysics coupling. This Technical Review presents a comprehensive appraisal of state-of-the-art computational models for granular particles of either naturally occurring shapes or engineered geometries. It focuses on particle shape characterization, representation and implementation, as well as its important effects. In addition, the particles may be hard, highly deformable, crushable or phase transformable; they might change their behaviour in the presence of interstitial fluids and are sensitive to density, confining stress and flow state. We describe generic methodologies that capture the universal features of granular matter and some unique approaches developed for special but important applications.},

It is shown that not only the governing equation but also the energy dissipation rate can be obtained accurately from DEM data for systems having different physical properties of particles and operating conditions.

  abstract      = {Lithium dendrite growth is the main trigger for internal short circuits (ISC) of lithium-ion batteries. This paper investigates the lithium dendrite growth during the whole short circuit evolution process. In this paper, the lithium dendrite growth is divided into the initial deposition of the initial operation and the secondary deposition due to the internal short circuit. Firstly, a two-dimensional model based on the phase-field theory is developed and the growth in static electrolyte is investigated. Secondly, we summarize the whole evolution process and analyze the internal structural changes as well as the external features due to the internal short circuit. Based on this analysis, a model of secondary deposition in a flowing electrolyte is proposed. The model takes into account the effect of the flowing electrolyte on the dendrites. Finally, we investigate the growth of dendrites during secondary deposition. Due to an internal short circuit that damages the separator, a flowing electrolyte appears around the damaged region. This flowing electrolyte leads to uneven growth of dendrites, with ``splitting'' and ``branch inhibition''. This phenomenon will accelerate the continued deposition of dendrites and induce a secondary internal short circuit. This work provides a quantitative simulation model for dendrite growth when an ISC occurs. Moreover, it also provides a reference for designing the structure of liquid batteries with high cycle times and safety.},

In this work, a novel design with axial gas injections is proposed with the examination for waste heat recovery from the spodumene calcination process. Part of the heat transfer fluid is diverted from the main inlet to the axial inlets, which leads to heat transfer enhancement due to flow rate drop and elevated temperature difference. Compared to the conventional design, axial gas injection leads to an immediate enhancement in temperature uniformity, with a maximum of 64~K decrease in temperature difference, which could reduce thermally induced damage and improve device safety. The axial design also leads to increased charging efficiency by up to 21~\%, with the charging efficiency increasing with the number of axial inlets. Further investigation shows charging efficiency is inversely proportional to porosity, with porosity decreasing from 0.5 to 0.3, charging efficiency increases by 15~\% at the end of charging, while the round-trip efficiency is on the contrary. Moreover, studies on heat transfer fluid show that elevated mass flow rate leads to decreased charging efficiency and improved round-trip efficiency, which is due to higher entropy generation and enhanced heat transfer rate. For a dedicated application, the packed bed needs to be optimized depending on the thermal performance, safety, and given requirements.},

To investigate the effects of steam extraction on the hydrodynamic characteristics and desalination performance and then determine the ranges of rotational speed and extraction pressure suitable for the operation of RSCE, three-dimensional steady numerical simulations are conducted on the supercavitating flows in RSCE under different rotational speeds and extraction pressures. The results show that steam extraction has little influence on the morphological characteristics and resistance characteristics and is conducive to the generation of the steam in the supercavity. Besides, the steam extraction process enhances the re-entrant jets generated in the region with the radius less than 55 mm under all the rotational speeds other than 3250 r/min and under all the extraction pressures other than 3000 Pa. Despite little change of morphological characteristics, the intensified re-entrant jet increases the length and thickness of the developed supercavity, while decreases the size of the underdeveloped supercavity due to its interaction with the blade. RSCE has low energy consumption when operating under low extraction pressure and the rotational speed of 3750 r/min.},

Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26\,257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90–99\%. Furthermore, with the data set built by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87\% accuracy in predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry subdisciplines.},

Some benchmark tests including a single wettable particle trapped at the fluid-fluid interface without gravity, capillary interactions between two wettable particles under gravity, and sinking of a horizontal cylinder through an air-water interface are carried out to validate present CACE LBE for fluid-fluid-solid flows. Raft sinking of multiple horizontal cylinders (up to five cylinders) through an air-water interface is further investigated with the present CACE LBE, and a nontrivial dynamics with an unusual nonmonotonic motion of the multiple cylinders is observed in the vertical plane.

Fractional factorial design was used to identify which of the extrusion cooking factors most affected seed coat dietary fibre composition and physicochemical properties. Extrusion cooking significantly increased soluble dietary fibre content of lupin seed coat, from 29.03\,g/kg dry basis to a maximum of 90.28\,g/kg dry basis, while decreasing insoluble dietary fibre content from 898.91\,g/kg dry basis to 828.85\,g/kg dry basis. Water solubility increased (4.02–4.47\% vs. 5.37–9.64\% dry basis) whereas water binding capacity slightly decreased (3.84–3.88\,g/g vs. 3.15–3.73\,g/g dry basis) after extrusion cooking. The screw speed, total moisture content in barrel and barrel temperature were identified as the most important processing factors.

So it is difficult to achieve the operating state monitoring in real-time by the sensor signals only. The recently booming deep learning (DL) is promising to provide a new way for flow field reconstruction due to its excellent data mining capability. For these, a fast flow field prediction model based on deep learning is proposed for the supersonic inlet in a wide operation range. To establish the data set for model training, numerical simulations at various Mach number and flight altitude obtained by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method are carried out. The trained model successfully established the mapping relationship between the inlet flow field and the input features. Both the start and unstart flows can be reconstructed by the model with high accuracy and efficiency. Then, two different types of input features are compared to test the influence of different input features on the model performance. The results indicated that the pressure distribution inputs perform better than that of operating conditions, which is because the wall pressure distribution contains more information and characteristics of the flow. Furthermore, compared with the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and wind tunnel experiments, the model has higher efficiency in predicting the inlet flow field with high accuracy. Finally, interpolation and extrapolation tests are conducted and the results revealed that the model is of high robustness and generalization ability.},

  abstract      = {Using an optical fiber particle concentration measuring system, an extensive study was carried out of voidage profiles in a circulating fluidized bed riser of square cross-section. Both lateral and axial voidage profiles were obtained. Particle concentration is not necessarily lowest at the axis of the riser, but may go through a minimum between the wall and the axis. The study also reveals the influence of the corners on the voidage profile. Because of the exit effect, profiles of voidage at the top of the riser are asymmetric. Bimodal and even trimodal probability distributions of particle concentration are found. The intermittency index is used to characterize the heterogeneity/homogeneity of the flow.},

In this article, optimal feed composition, feeding rate and operation pressure, which have only slight influences on the bed temperature, are determined by steady-state optimization, and the optimal performance are shown to be restricted by explosive limit, the capacity of down-stream decarbonater and the specification of circulation compressor. Conversely, the amount of EDC addition and coolant temperature, which are sensitive to the bed temperature for a constant productivity and thus have a large effect on catalyst sintering, are determined by dynamic optimization as functions of catalyst age. The optimal performance obtained by the dynamic optimization policy with time-dependent inlet EDC concentration is found to be very close to that of the constant EDC addition policy. Because of the opposite effects of EDC addition and coolant temperature increase, the optimal performance is not sensitive to the catalyst stability to temperature. In addition, the optimal EDC concentration level is found independent of the productivity rate.},

  abstract      = {The gas–particle turbulent flow in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser is investigated numerically by large eddy simulation (LES) coupled with Lagrangian approach. The gas phase model is based on locally averaged two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations (N–S Eqs.) for twophase flow with fluid turbulence calculated by LES, in which the effect of particles on subgrid-scale (SGS) gas flow is taken into account. The particles' motion is treated by a Lagrangian approach, in which the particles are assumed to interact through binary, instantaneous, and non-elastic collisions. The model predicts the heterogeneous particle flow structure and the gas and particle mean velocities and turbulent intensities. The gas turbulence induces particle lateral dispersion. The instantaneous gas turbulent intensity is attenuated by the formation of clusters, whereas the intensity is enhanced by the increase of gas–particle interactions. Globally, the presence of clusters enhances the gas turbulent intensity. Finally, the turbulent model is noticeably affected by an empirically assigned gas constant Ck and it consistently predicts values of the gas and particle turbulent intensities higher than those predicted by Smagorinsky's method.},

  abstract      = {Finite element method (FEM) is employed to simulate the transient heat conduction during the collision between spherical particles. The total collision time is divided into many small time steps. At each time step, the contact area is evaluated by the Hertz's theory of elastic collision and based on this information, a grid system is generated for FEM computation to determine the temperature distribution in a particle and the heat exchange between particles. The total heat exchange is the sum of the heat exchange at all time steps. The FEM approach and computer code are verified by the good agreement between the numerical and analytical solutions for a well-established case. It is then used to simulate the transient heat transfer process during particle collision. It is shown that the heat exchange is affected by variables related to collision conditions and material properties. The results are qualitatively consistent with those obtained analytically based on the semi-infinite-media assumption. However, the analytical model overestimates the heat exchange, particularly when the Fourier number is high. A modified equation is proposed to overcome this problem based on the present FEM results. The equation is particularly suited for the newly developed particle scale modeling of the heat transfer of multiparticle systems.},

  abstract      = {In the fast reaction category, the turbulent reactive mixing strongly affects the reaction products yield and distribution. The present work adopts a high-efficiency vortex structure induced by a novel static mixer – hollow cross disk (HCD) to enhance the turbulent reactive mixing within the tubular turbulent flow. Specifically, the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMoM) coupled with the interaction-by-exchange-with-the-mean model (IEM) is utilized to simulate the consecutive competitive reactions system in this tubular turbulent flow. In order to quantitatively evaluate the enhanced mixing effect of the HCD, the turbulent reacting flows in the Kenics static mixer and coaxial jet mixer have also been studied. A combining analysis of turbulent flow field and the chemical species distribution indicates that the turbulent mixing enhancement mechanisms of these two static mixers. The simulation suggests that the sinusoidal wave structure in the HCD generate an important flow structure-counter vortex pairs (CVPs), which increases the momentum exchange between the near-wall region and the flow core. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the mixture fraction and reaction product concentration in these configurations agrees well with its turbulent flow field characteristics. The improved turbulent mixing initially is located at the jet periphery when at 0 {$<$} z/D {\$<\$} 2, which fits well with the HCD's longitudinal evolution of turbulent energy dissipation. Whereas at z/D {\$>\$} 2, CVPs of the HCD ameliorate the near-wall area's turbulent mixing and thus increase the reaction productivity and selectivity. Additionally, the effects of flow rate on segregation index are studied to suggest that the improvement of Xs for HCD is of about 35\% relative to the original tubular flow.},

In recent years, supported metal nanoparticle catalysts have been researched due to their high metal utilization. Low-temperature catalysts have shown promising results, including high selectivity, high shift rates, and higher activity potential. Additionally, significant progress has been made in removing trace CO through the redox reaction in electrolytic cell. This paper reviews the development of WGS reaction catalysts, including the reaction mechanism, catalyst design, and innovative research methods. The catalyst plays a crucial role in the WGS reaction, and this paper provides an instant of catalyst design under different conditions. The progress of catalysts is closely related to the development of advanced characterization techniques.

However, limited research exists regarding the influence of different ultrasound types on the flotation process. Specifically, the impact of combined ultrasound and the comparison of horn- and bath-type ultrasounds on flotation have not been fully investigated. To address this knowledge gap, a comprehensive study to explore the effects of different ultrasonic pretreatments on the flotation of flake graphite was conducted. A Box-Behnken design is employed to analyze the effects of combined ultrasound on graphite flotation. By characterizing the properties of graphite samples before and after the ultrasonic treatment, the aim is to elucidate the mechanism underlying the impact of ultrasound on graphite flotation. The experimental results indicated that the ultrasonic cavitation intensity exerted a significant influence on the graphite flotation recovery. Both horn- and bath- type ultrasounds contributed to flotation, but horn-type ultrasound demonstrated a more pronounced effect, leading to a 7\% increase in flotation recovery, whereas bath-type ultrasound resulted in only a 2\% increase. Furthermore, the cavitation intensity of combined ultrasound was found to be higher than that of single-frequency ultrasound in the same duration. However, the performance of graphite flotation was better with short duration combined ultrasound pretreatment, while the opposite trend was observed for a long duration ultrasound pretreatment. These findings may inform the development of more efficient and effective ultrasonic pretreatments for flotation separation processes.},

The calcination temperature and residence time are crucial in the catalyst production process, with optimal conditions en-hancing catalyst activity and stability. To improve the longevity of roasting furnaces, optimizing the construction structure of the calciner is critical. This study develops a novel calciner structure and mathematical models to understand the effect of structural parameters on critical performance. Computer simulations, predictive modelling, and rotational velocity analysis of the novel calciner were performed using a DEM. The effects of the baffle angle and overlap ratio on the flow pattern and MRT were studied through simulations and experiments. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The operating parameter with the greatest effect on the MRT was the rotational angular velocity, followed by the baffle angle and overlap ratio. (2) The MRT calculation based on the numerical method model showed an error of no more than 10.0\% compared to the actual measurement data, confirming the model's accuracy. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of the complex MRT and flow field processes within this novel calciner.

The system is capable of measuring the force up to 50 g with an accuracy of 1 mg. The effects of the interparticle distance and Re on the drag forces of both the trailing and leading particles are examined. An empirical equation is obtained to describe the drag force variation of a single particle trailing in the wake of a leading particle. A mechanistic model is also developed to account for the motion of the trailing particle in the wake region of the leading particle as well as for their contact velocity. Moreover, a simultaneous flow-field visualization is conducted to characterize the wake flow phenomena. The results indicate that Re affects not only the magnitude of the drag force of an interacting particle but also its variation with the interparticle distance. At contact, the drag force of a trailing particle can be less than one-fifth of the drag force of a single particle without interparticle effects. Both tbe drag force measurements and the flow-field visualization reflect that the wake-influenced region of the leading particle can be longer at a lower Re. The mechanistic model suggests that both the drag force and the Basset force should be included in the description of the motion of the trailing particle in the wake region of the leading particle. The model predicting the contact velocity of the two particles is reasonably validated with the experimental data.},

In this study, the influence of ring-type internals on the reduction of nonuniformity in a riser of 7.6 cm in diameter and 3 m in height was investigated. Three ring internals with open areas of 70\%, 90\% and 95\% were installed in five axial positions in the riser. Measurement results for solids hold-up distribution of sand particles obtained using a fibre optic probe indicate that the internals can reduce radial nonuniformity, and evenly redistribute solids in the radial direction. Under high superficial gas velocities and low solids circulation rates, reversed radial solids distribution profiles with more dilute flow in the wall region than in the core region were also observed. A detailed study on the radial solids distributions around the ring internals shows the formation of a denser region above the 70\% opening ring as compared to above the 90\% and 95\% opening internals and a mom dilute region below all three rings. Results of the axial voidage distribution with the presence of internals show the formation of a zigzag type axial profile instead of the regular S-shape profile.},

Transport equations, which are general for the moments and independent of the distribution functions, are derived for the semicontinuous systems of both gas and liquid phases. A general treatment of the VLE is conducted which can be applied with any cubic equation of state (EOS). Relations for the properties of the continuous species are formulated. The model was further applied to calculate the sub- and super-critical vaporization processes of droplets of a representative petroleum fuel mixture \pm{} diesel fuel. The results show that the liquid mixture droplet exhibits an intrinsic transient vaporization behavior regardless of whether the pressure is sub- or super-critical. The regression rate of the liquid mixture droplet is reduced signi\textregistered{}cantly during the late vaporization period. The comparison with the results of a singlecomponent substitute fuel case emphasizes the importance of considering the multi-component nature of practical mixture fuel and the critical vaporization eects in practical applications. This paper provides a practical means for more realistically describing the high-pressure vaporization processes of practical fuels. \'{O} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we present a mechanistic model in which the formation of the heterogeneous structure is due to the radial migration of solid flow from the wall toward center as well as due to the non-uniform acceleration of solids across the crosssection near the bottom of the riser. Firstly we present the general governing equations and discuss problem closure; then a simplified model with one-way flow coupling between the wall region and the core-annulus region is proposed to simulate the formation and development process of heterogeneous flow structures in the riser. Typical results of the three-zone flow structure along the riser are illustrated, which include the axial distributions of solids concentration and phase velocities in each zone, in addition to the pressure distributions. The model is also validated against the ECT measurements.},

  abstract      = {Particle science and technology is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area with its core being the understanding of the relationships between micro- and macroscopic properties of particulate/granular matter--a state of matter that is widely encountered but poorly understood. The macroscopic behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions between individual particles as well as interactions with surrounding fluids. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in terms of these interaction forces is therefore key to leading to truly interdisciplinary research into particulate matter and producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be effectively achieved via particle scale research based on detailed microdynamic information such as the forces acting on and trajectories of individual particles in a considered system. In recent years, such research has been rapidly developed worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology. This paper reviews the work in this area with special reference to the discrete element method and associated theoretical developments. It covers three important aspects: models for the calculation of the particle–particle and particle–fluid interaction forces, coupling of discrete element method with computational fluid dynamics to describe particle–fluid flow, and the theories for linking discrete to continuum modelling. Needs for future development are also discussed.},

  abstract      = {A simple and reliable method to estimate the solid holdup distribution and solid residence time in a gas–solid riser flow is essential to the optimum design and efficient operations of riser reactors. The traditional approach of equating the local solid holdup to the pressure drop in a riser overlooks the effects of solid acceleration and energy dissipation in the acceleration and dense phase transport regions. The energy dissipation in these regions is mainly due to the interfacial friction between interstitial gas and suspended solids, inter-solid collisions, as well as solid–wall fraction. Most momentum-based models fail to account for the energy dissipation of inter-solid collisions, and the models using the simple granular kinetic theory fail to account for the energy dissipation in micro-sliding or rolling from off-center inter-solid collisions. This paper presents an energy-based mechanistic model to analyze the partitions of the axial gradient of pressure by solid acceleration, collision-induced energy dissipation and solid holdup in gas–solid riser flows. Based on this model, more reasonable estimation of axial distributions of solid holdup and resulted solid velocity can be obtained. Our analysis shows that the effect of solid acceleration on the pressure drop can be significant in a range of moderate solid holdup (typically from 3.5\% to 12\% by solid volume fraction) whereas the effect of energy dissipation becomes important in the dense phase transport region (typically when the solid volume fraction above 5\%). The exemplified results indicate that the traditional approach of equating the local solid holdup to the pressure drop overestimates the solid holdup by an error up to 50\% in the acceleration and dense phase transport regions in typical gas–solid riser flow applications.},

  abstract      = {Understanding and modelling the dynamic behaviour of particulate systems has been a major research focus worldwide for many years. Discrete particle simulation plays an important role in this area. This technique can provide dynamic information, such as the trajectories of and transient forces acting on individual particles, which is difficult to obtain by the conventional experimental techniques. Consequently, it has been increasingly used by various investigators for different particulate processes. In spite of the large bulk volume, little effort has been made to comprehensively review and summarize the progress made in the past. To overcome this gap, we have recently completed a review of the major work in this area in two separate parts. The first part has been published [Zhu, H.P., Zhou, Z.Y., Yang, R.Y., Yu, A.B., 2007. Discrete particle simulation of particulate systems: theoretical developments. Chemical Engineering Science 62, 3378–3392.], which reviews the major theoretical developments. This paper is the second one, aiming to provide a summary of the studies based on discrete particle simulation in the past two decades or so. The studies are categorized into three subject areas: particle packing, particle flow, and particle–fluid flow. The major findings are discussed, with emphasis on the microdynamics including packing/flow structure and particle–particle, particle–fluid and particle–wall interaction forces. It is concluded that discrete particle simulation is an effective method for particle scale research of particulate matter. The needs for future research are also discussed.},

The results reveal that with increasing Ug, local solids concentrations go through three evolution stages, reflecting a gradual regime transition process.

The upflowing particle velocity is strong function of both superficial gas velocity and spatial position. However, the descending particle velocity mainly depends on superficial gas velocity.

Further simulations were performed to study the influences of initial liquid phase height to width ratio and inlet area to column cross-sectional area ratio on the global gas holdup in the bubble column.

ML can provide flexible techniques to facilitate the conceptual development of new robust predictive models for multiphase flows and reactors by finding hidden pattern/information/mechanism in a data set. Due to such emergence, we thereby comprehensively survey, explore, analyze, and discuss key advancements of recent ML applications to hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and reactions in single-phase and multiphase flow systems from different aspects: (1) development of multiphase closure models of drag force, turbulence stresses and heat/mass transfer to improve the accuracy and efficiency of typical CFD simulations; (2) image reconstruction, regime identification, key parameter predictions, and optimization of multiphase flow and transport fields; (3) reaction kinetics modeling (e.g., predictions of reaction networks, kinetic parameters, and species production) and reaction condition optimization. These sections also discuss and analyze the key advantages and weakness of ML for solving the problems in the domain of multiphase flows and reactors. Finally, we summarize the under-solving challenges and opportunities in order to identify future directions that would be useful for the research community.

  abstract      = {As one of the most preferred technologies, fluidized beds with droplet injection have been widely applied in a variety of industries attribute to the advantages of excellent mixing effect as well as consecutive interphase contact. However, pronounced slugging and gas channeling may occur with the existence of droplets, where a large proportion of bed solids would be lumped together. This study focused on the hydrodynamics and cohesive-like characteristics of solid particles in a pseudo-2D droplet gas-solid fluidized bed via two-way coupled CFD-DEM numerical simulations with the consideration of droplets coating process and liquid bridge force. Results revealed that the existence of droplets would lead to poor fluidization characteristics. It could be summarized that the increase of surface tension would lead to inadequate mixing. At the same time, larger value of liquid viscosity would cause a slower particle motion, while cases that exhibited vigorous fluidization corresponded to smaller values of viscosity. The influences cast by different contact angles were also studied and results showed that choosing an appropriate contact angle is of paramount importance to the optimization of the fluidization quality. It was also found that the more droplets injected, the worse the mixing behavior, while changing the number of droplets injected had no significant effect on the flow pattern and particle motion.},

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics combined with discrete element method (CFD–DEM) is widely adopted to study particle–fluid multiphase systems. However, due to the global dynamical evolution and the naturally non-uniform distribution of particles, the computational load in parallel computing varies dynamically in each process, leading to significant load imbalance. Thus, a dynamic load balancing (DLB) algorithm is proposed for parallel CFD–DEM simulations in the CPU–GPU heterogeneous architecture. A type of computing load analyzing grid (AG) is developed which covers the entire simulation region. Then Kalman filtering and linear weighted method is used to solve the weight of fluid grids and particles. The domain decomposition scheme is updated according to the weights of AGs dynamically. This DLB method is tested for gas–solid fluidized beds and periodic gas–solid systems of different scales. Results show that the DLB algorithm can significantly speed up CFD–DEM simulation and the highest performance is 2.28 times faster with DLB.},

This study addresses the limited understanding of biomass particle hydrodynamics by investigating a pseudo-2D pressurized fluidized bed using digital image analysis techniques. The effects of biomass mass fraction in binary mixtures with inert particles and operating pressure on minimum and final fluidization velocities, mixing/segregation characteristics, and bubbling behaviors were comprehensively examined. Results indicated that the minimum and final fluidization velocities of binary mixtures increase with biomass mass fraction and decrease as pressure rises from ambient condition to 0.6~MPa. The mixing index decreases with increasing biomass loading, with a critical mass fraction of 25~\% beyond which fluidization deteriorates or fails due to particle channeling. Higher operating pressure improves biomass fluidization but negatively affects the mixing degree between biomass and inert particles. This adverse effect is attributed to reduced bubble size and the corresponding decrease in the driving force necessary for particle mixing. These findings enhance the understanding of biomass particle dynamics and significantly contribute to the advancement of efficient and sustainable biomass energy conversion processes.},

The implementation of this technology requires the development of efficient and cost-effective methods for the management of excess sludge. The aim of the research was to evaluate the effects of hydrodynamic cavitation on the efficiency of aerobic granular sludge digestion. Respirometric measurements were performed at a temperature of 38 \textdegree{}C and an initial organic load of 5.0 gVS/L. The changes in the properties of the pretreated biomass, the kinetics of methane fermentation, the amount and composition of the biogas produced, and an energetic evaluation of the process were carried out. A significant influence of hydrodynamic cavitation on the transfer of organic compounds into the dissolved phase was demonstrated. The degree of solubilisation was 37\% for COD and 42\% and for TOC. The efficiency of CH4 production from the pretreated sludge reached a value of 496 \pm{} 12 mL/gVS, which corresponds to an increase of 19.6\% compared to the raw biomass. The influence of cavitation on the CH4 content of the biogas was not observed. Strong correlations were found between the efficiency of anaerobic digestion and the concentration of dissolved organic compounds and the hydrodynamic cavitation time used. The gross energy yield was closely correlated with the amount of CH4. The highest comparable values of 3.12 Wh/gTS to 3.18 Wh/gTS were found in the variants in which the hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) time was between 15 min and 50 min. The highest net energy production of 2890 kWh/MgTS was achieved after 15 min of pretreatment.},

  abstract      = {Characterization by means of Kolmogorov entropy shows that the dynamics of the bottom bed in small size circulating fluidized bed risers are significantly different from the dynamics of the dense bottom bed in large size risers and, as a consequence, two types of circulating regimes are introduced: the exploding bubble bed for large risers and the circulating 'slugging' bed for small risers, the latter at high superficial gas velocities. In a pictorial fluidization diagram ten gas-solid fluidization regimes are given, seven of which are experimentally identified with the Kolmogorov entropy by varying the superficial gas velocity, riser solids holdup and diameter (or width) of the riser: bubbling bed, slugging bed, exploding bubble bed, intermediate turbulentbed, circulating 'slugging' bed, intermediate dilute flow, and dilute transport flow. No transition could be identified between the exploding bubble bed at captive conditions and the exploding bubble bed at circulatingconditions in the dense bottom bed of the two largest facilities in this study. This suggests that the dense boUom bed in large size risers can be considered as a bubblingbed. A turbulentbed was found in none of the facilities of this study with the Geldart B solids used. As well as by the Kolmogorov entropy (chaos analysis), the hydrodynamicshave been characterized by amplitude of pressure fluctuations, while a solids distributionanalysis has also been carried out. The study has been made in four (circulating) fluidized beds of different size and design, all operated with 0.30 mm silica sand. The dimensions of the fluidized bed risers are 1.47 X 1.42 x 13.5 m, 0.70 x 0.12 x 8.5 m, 0.12 m i.d. X 5.8 m, and 0.083 m i.d. x 4.0 m. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

At superficial velocities below 0.336Ut, the solid fraction and granular temperature are uniform throughout the bed. At higher superficial velocities, the solid fraction tends to decrease with height above the distributor, whilst the granular temperature first increases to a maximum before decaying towards the top of the bed. Correlation of the mean granular temperature with the mean solid fraction and the local granular temperature with the local solid fraction both suggest that the granular temperature in the liquid fluidized bed can be described solely in terms of the solid fraction. The granular temperature increases monotonically with solid fraction to a maximum at   \approx{} 0.18 where it then decreases monotonically as   approaches the close-packed limit.},

This paper attempts to estimate wave breaking dissipation through a passive acoustic method. Initially, regular waves were forced to break in a flume. The breaking energy loss (severity) and the underwater acoustic noise were recorded. Two kinds of thresholds, in terms of sound wave amplitude and the ratio of sound wave height to period, respectively, were used together to identify the sound waves generated by newly formed bubbles. The frequencies of these sound waves are connected with the bubble sizes. Thus, a relationship between the mean bubble radius and the breaking severity was established and found to be linear. This laboratory relationship was then applied to Lake George data to study the breaking dissipation rate across the spectrum. An average acoustic spectral density threshold was proposed to identify breaking events from acoustic records in the field. The sound waves associated with bubble formation were selected by means of the same two kinds of threshold as used in the laboratory. Thus, the mean bubble radius of each breaking event was obtained and translated into the breaking severity. The values of experimental dissipation were compared with previous relevant results obtained through different methods as well as the wave breaking dissipation source terms ST6 (WAVEWATCH-III model) and are in good agreement with both of them.},

This paper presents a study on the liquid fuel vaporizing and mixing processes. An effective method for the calculation of turbulent two phase evaporating flow has been developed, based on a realistic droplet vaporization model and a comprehensive turbulence-particle interaction model. Using the method, the influences of inlet gas swirling and heating on water droplets evaporation and mixing processes are numerically studied and compared with our experimentally measured data which show a reasonable agreement. Then, fuel droplets evaporation and mixing processes in the pre-vaporized, premixed oil burner at different confinement conditions are simulated. According to our studies, a strong inlet air swirl can greatly enhance mixing between the droplets, the air, and the recirculated flue gas which enters the burner. It also sharply reduces the droplet velocity, and thus prolongs the droplet vaporizing and mixing time to maintain a stable premixed combustion, proper combustion chamber confinement should be designed to ensure that sufficient recirculated flue gas is supplied to fully vaporize the fuel droplets before exiting from the burner and the actual mass fraction of the gaseous fuel is higher than the flammability limit one.},
