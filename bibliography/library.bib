  abstract      = {This book identifies the process as the central factor in plant automation and develops theory and practice to achieve good dynamic performance. Approaches are presented for measurement selection, process modifications, control structure design, and algorithm tuning to achieve good performance over a range of operating conditions. The sequence of topics - modeling, single-loop control and tuning, enhancements, multiloop control, and design - builds the student's ability to analyze increasingly complex systems, culminating in multiloop control design. The full complement of fundamental topics is reinforced by realistic process examples, including challenging end-of-chapter problems. Each technology is analyzed to provide guidelines for design and algorithm tuning; this approach demonstrates how fundamentals can lead to excellent practice and encourages the student to develop sound generalizations. The accompanying workbook and software, in the MATLAB environment, enable students to reproduce and extend the solved problems and design cases in the textbook. The simulations enable students to implement the digital implementations of most methods, for example, model identification, PID algorithm, windup protection, cascade, feedforward, and model predictive control.},

  abstract      = {Introduction to Process Control, Third Edition continues to provide a bridge between traditional and modern views of process control by blending conventional topics with a broader perspective of integrated process operation, control, and information systems. Updated and expanded throughout, this third edition addresses issues highly relevant to today's teaching of process control:   Discusses smart manufacturing, new data preprocessing techniques, and machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts that are part of current smart manufacturing decisions   Includes extensive references to guide the reader to the resources needed to solve modeling, classification, and monitoring problems   Introduces the link between process optimization and process control (optimizing control), including the effect of disturbances on the optimal plant operation, the concepts of steady-state and dynamic back-off as ways to quantify the economic benefits of control, and how to determine an optimal transition policy during a planned production change   Incorporates an introduction to the modern architectures of industrial computer control systems with real case studies and applications to pilot-scale operations   Analyzes the expanded role of process control in modern manufacturing, including model-centric technologies and integrated control systems   Integrates data processing/reconciliation and intelligent monitoring in the overall control system architecture    Drawing on the authors' combined 60 years of teaching experiences, this classroom-tested text is designed for chemical engineering students but is also suitable for industrial practitioners who need to understand key concepts of process control and how to implement them. The text offers a comprehensive pedagogical approach to reinforce learning and presents a concept first followed by an example, allowing students to grasp theoretical concepts in a practical manner and uses the same problem in each chapter, culminating in a complete control design strategy. A vast number of exercises throughout ensure readers are supported in their learning and comprehension.   Downloadable MATLAB\textregistered{} toolboxes for process control education as well as the main simulation examples from the book offer a user-friendly software environment for interactively studying the examples in the text. These can be downloaded from the publisher's website. Solutions manual is available for qualifying professors from the publisher.},

  abstract      = {The aim of this paper is to present analytic rules for PID controller tuning that are simple and still result in good closed-loop behavior. The starting point has been the IMC-PID tuning rules that have achieved widespread industrial acceptance. The rule for the integral term has been modified to improve disturbance rejection for integrating processes. Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model. Simple analytic rules for model reduction are presented to obtain a model in this form, including the ``half rule'' for obtaining the effective time delay.},
