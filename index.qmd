## Course Overview

This course builds upon introductory process control course (CHEN3005: Process
Instrumentation and Control). It introduces advanced modeling and control
techniques. The course aims to provide broad overview of various topics and
provide foundational knowledge for further exploration of the subject. 
While not comprehensive, it covers essential material, and current trends.

Most of the material is designed to be easily understood by undergraduate 
chemical engineering student. However, some background in mathematics,
including differential equations, as well as a solid understanding of material
and energy balance concepts and unit operations.

The unit is divided into two parts: advanced control, and advanced modeling. In
the advanced control section, we delve into the complexities of industrial
processes, which are dynamic and often multivariable. To effectively control
such processes, advanced techniques beyond simple feedback loops studied in the
Process Instrumentation and Control unit are required. The key focus of this
section is on the design and implementation of advanced process control methods
in process plants. Additionally, we will explore the utilization of Simulink, a
MATLAB tool, for controller design and simulation.

In advanced modeling section, we will address the crucial role of
mathematical modeling in the design and optimization of process equipment. This
section equips students with modeling tools for data analysis, empirical
modeling, and process design. These tools are essential for understanding and
representing the behavior of complex processes, aiding in optimization efforts
and decision-making. This year, we will focus on data driven models and also
explore some aspects of machine learning and its applications to statistical
process control. 

By combining the two components, students will gain the necessary skills to
tackle the challenges of dynamic and multivariable industrial processes,
enabling them to understand, and design effective control strategies and
optimize process performance.
